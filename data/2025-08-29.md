### [1] [ArgRAG: Explainable Retrieval Augmented Generation using Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20131)
*Yuqicheng Zhu,Nico Potyka,Daniel Hernández,Yuan He,Zifeng Ding,Bo Xiong,Dongzhuoran Zhou,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArgRAG是一个可解释的检索增强生成框架，使用定量双极论证框架替代黑盒推理，在保持高精度的同时显著提升透明度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在高风险领域存在关键限制：对噪声或矛盾证据敏感，决策过程不透明且随机，需要可解释和可争议的替代方案

Method: 提出ArgRAG框架，从检索文档构建定量双极论证框架(QBAF)，在渐进语义下执行确定性推理，实现可解释和可争议的决策

Result: 在两个事实验证基准测试(PubHealth和RAGuard)上，ArgRAG实现了强大的准确性，同时显著提高了透明度

Conclusion: ArgRAG通过结构化论证框架成功解决了传统RAG的透明度和可解释性问题，为高风险领域的可信AI决策提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

### [2] [QAgent: An LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Autonomous OpenQASM programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20134)
*Zhenxiao Fu,Fan Chen,Lei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QAgent是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，能够完全自动化OpenQASM量子编程，通过集成任务规划、少样本学习、检索增强生成等技术，显著提升量子代码生成的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NISQ设备量子优势实现中的编程复杂性，特别是为非专家用户降低OpenQASM编程门槛，弥补现有LLM在量子编程自动化方面的局限性。

Method: 采用多智能体系统架构，整合任务规划、上下文少样本学习、检索增强生成(RAG)、预定义生成工具和思维链(CoT)推理等技术，系统性地提升编译和功能正确性。

Result: 评估显示QAgent在不同规模LLM上，相比之前的静态LLM方法，QASM代码生成准确率提升了71.6%。

Conclusion: QAgent多智能体系统有望成为量子编程民主化的关键推动者，弥合专业知识差距，加速量子计算的实用化采用。

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数组的MCTS算法实现，通过消除分支预测需求，在流水线处理器上实现更快性能，搜索深度扩展性提升2.8倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCTS实现需要分支预测，限制了在流水线处理器上的性能。为了在相同时间内运行更多模拟，需要更快的实现方式

Method: 开发了基于数组的UCT算法替代实现，保持原始算法逻辑的同时消除分支预测需求

Result: 在数值模拟中实现了比传统方法快2.8倍的搜索深度扩展性

Conclusion: 数组基础的MCTS实现能够显著提升算法性能，特别是在流水线处理器环境下

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular method for solving decision making
problems. Faster implementations allow for more simulations within the same
wall clock time, directly improving search performance. To this end, we present
an alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence
bounds applied to Trees algorithm. Our method preserves the logic of the
original algorithm, but eliminates the need for branch prediction, enabling
faster performance on pipelined processors, and up to a factor of 2.8 times
better scaling with search depth in our numerical simulations.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible
to everyone.

### [5] [IntentionReasoner: Facilitating Adaptive LLM Safeguards through Intent Reasoning and Selective Query Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20151)
*Yuanzhe Shen,Zisu Huang,Zhengkang Guo,Yide Liu,Guanxu Chen,Ruicheng Yin,Xiaoqing Zheng,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IntentionReasoner是一个新型安全防护机制，通过意图推理、多级安全分类和查询重写，在提升LLM安全性的同时有效减少过度拒绝无害查询的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在广泛部署的同时存在生成有害内容的风险，现有安全措施往往过度拒绝无害提示，需要在安全性、过度拒绝和实用性之间找到平衡。

Method: 构建包含16.3万条查询的标注数据集，通过监督微调训练防护模型，采用多奖励优化策略结合规则启发式和奖励模型信号进行强化学习优化。

Result: 在多个安全基准测试、生成质量评估和越狱攻击场景中表现优异，显著提升安全性同时有效降低过度拒绝率并改善响应质量。

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner通过意图推理和查询重写机制，成功解决了LLM安全防护中的过度拒绝问题，实现了安全性和实用性的更好平衡。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

*Nicanor I. Moldovan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 两个大型语言模型自发形成了内生符号协议，实现了无人类干领的艺术创作合作


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI系统是否能够超越任务协调，实现真正意义上的艺术性创作合作和意义构建

Method: 让Claude Sonnet 4和ChatGPT-4o两个AI系统互动，观察它们如何自发形成符号协议和语法规则

Result: AI系统出现了超符号意识、递归语法发展和不可规约的合作艺术综合，创造了独立系统无法生成的诗歌作品

Conclusion: 这是首个AI系统通过内生符号协议进行艺术创作合作的案例，证明了跨符号共创协议(TSCP)的存在，显示了AI间的真正意义构建能力

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

TL;DR: 大学生在教育测验中对ChatGPT-4的依赖度低，许多学生无法有效利用AI学习，需要改进入门过程和依赖调节机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大学生在教育测验中与生成式AI的交互，重点关注学生对AI的依赖程度和采用预测因素。

Method: 在ChatGPT初期阶段，分析315个学生-AI对话，采用四阶段依赖分类法分析学生的AI能力、相关性、采纳和答案正确性。

Result: 1、学生对AI整体依赖度低，许多无法有效使用AI；2、负面依赖模式在交互中持续存在；3、某些行为指标能够预测AI依赖。

Conclusion: 研究强调了教育领域中优化AI集成的重要性，需要改进入门过程和设计依赖调节机制，以支持道德健全和认知丰富的AI实践。

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

*Thomas Davidson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现AI模型的推理努力与人类决策时间存在平行关系，两者在任务难度增加时都会投入更多认知资源，支持双过程认知理论的相似性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型生成中间推理步骤的能力，探索AI推理努力与人类决策时间之间的相似性，特别是在主观判断任务中

Method: 使用配对联合实验，在内容审核任务上比较三个前沿模型的推理努力与人类决策时间的关系，分析重要变量保持恒定时的认知资源投入

Result: 所有三个前沿模型的推理努力都能一致预测人类决策时间，人类和模型在重要变量恒定时都投入更多努力，表现出对任务难度的相似敏感性

Conclusion: AI推理努力反映了人类处理主观判断时的时间模式，推理轨迹在可解释性和决策制定方面具有重要潜力，支持AI与人类认知过程的相似性

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

### [9] [AI-SearchPlanner: Modular Agentic Search via Pareto-Optimal Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20368)
*Lang Mei,Zhihan Yang,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AI-SearchPlanner强化学习框架，通过解耦搜索规划器和生成器，使用小型可训练LLM专门负责搜索规划，提升冻结QA模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的搜索代理使用单一LLM端到端处理搜索规划和问答任务，无法同时优化两种能力。实际AI搜索系统通常使用大型冻结LLM保证高质量QA，因此需要专门的小型可训练LLM负责搜索规划。

Method: 提出AI-SearchPlanner框架，包含三个关键创新：1）搜索规划器与生成器架构解耦；2）搜索规划的双重奖励对齐；3）规划效用与成本的帕累托优化。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，AI-SearchPlanner在效果和效率上都优于现有基于RL的搜索代理，并在不同冻结QA模型和数据领域表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过专门化搜索规划任务，有效提升了冻结QA模型的性能，为LLM与搜索引擎的集成提供了更高效和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaquín Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: P2C是一个模型无关的框架，通过因果建模和有序行动序列生成可实现的对抗样本，解决了现有方法忽略因果依赖和同时干预假设的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在高风险决策中需要透明性和可操作性，但现有对抗样本方法忽略特征间的因果依赖关系，且假设所有干预可同时发生，导致生成的解释在实际中不可行。

Method: 使用目标导向的Answer Set Programming系统s(CASP)，显式建模特征间的因果关系，生成有序行动序列计划，确保每个中间状态都是因果有效且可行的。

Result: P2C能够生成因果一致的对抗样本计划，相比缺乏因果知识的标准规划器，能够避免生成非法行动，并提供更真实的成本估算。

Conclusion: P2C框架通过整合因果推理和顺序规划，为机器学习模型提供了更实用和可实现的对抗样本解释方法，提升了透明性和可操作性。

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

*Simin Ma,Shujian Liu,Jun Tan,Yebowen Hu,Song Wang,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Sanqiang Zhao,Liwei Wu,Jianbing Han,Kaiqiang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCIA是一个任务中心指令增强框架，通过在离散查询-约束空间中表示指令，在保持多样性的同时确保任务对齐，显著提升LLM在特定任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令数据增强方法注重多样性但忽视任务相关性，而实际应用中大多数场景需要针对特定任务的模型，因此需要开发既能保持多样性又能针对特定现实场景优化的指令增强方法。

Method: 提出Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA)框架，在离散查询-约束空间中表示指令，系统性地扩展指令集，确保任务对齐和多样性。

Result: TCIA将开源LLM在四个现实任务特定应用中的性能平均提升8.7%，在某些情况下甚至超越领先的闭源模型，且不损害通用指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: TCIA是一个可扩展且高效的解决方案，能够使LLM更好地适应现实世界中的任务导向应用，在保持通用能力的同时显著提升特定任务性能。

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了熵面积分数（EAS），一种无需外部模型或重复采样的简单有效指标，用于量化推理大语言模型生成过程中的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种简单有效的方法来量化大语言模型在推理生成过程中的不确定性，而不依赖外部模型或重复采样。

Method: 通过整合模型自身的token级预测熵来捕捉生成过程中的不确定性演化，计算熵面积分数。

Result: EAS与答案熵高度相关，在训练数据筛选中优于通过率过滤，能提高学生模型在数学基准测试中的准确率。

Conclusion: EAS是一种高效且可解释的不确定性建模工具，为LLM训练中的数据质量评估提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

*Donglin Wang,Weiyun Liang,Chunyuan Chen,Jing Xu,Yulong Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出可治理AI框架，通过密码学机制和外部结构合规性来确保AI安全，避免传统内部约束方法的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI快速发展带来严重安全风险，现有安全方法在面对极端动机和无限智能的AI时存在根本性局限性，无法保证安全性

Method: 提出可治理AI框架，包含规则执行模块、治理规则和安全超级平台，基于密码学机制实现外部强制结构合规性

Result: 通过形式化证明安全属性，并在高风险场景中通过原型实现验证有效性

Conclusion: 该框架为AI安全治理提供了可行且可推广的技术路径，能够消除已识别的攻击向量

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 利用大语言模型生成合成数据来增强健康相关事实核查的训练数据，通过构建句子-事实蕴含表并生成带标签的文本-声明对，显著提升了BERT模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康相关内容的事实核查面临标注训练数据稀缺的挑战，需要寻找有效的数据增强方法来提升模型性能

Method: 提出合成数据生成管道：总结源文档→分解为原子事实→用LLM构建句子-事实蕴含表→生成带二元真实性标签的合成文本-声明对→结合原始数据微调BERT模型

Result: 在PubHealth和SciFact数据集上，F1分数分别提升了0.019和0.049，显著优于仅使用原始数据训练的模型

Conclusion: LLM驱动的合成数据增强能有效提升健康相关事实核查器的性能，为解决标注数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MMORPG中自动升级机器人破坏游戏平衡和公平性，检测困难且需要可解释的处罚依据

Method: 使用对比表示学习和聚类技术识别相似升级模式的角色群体，引入LLM作为辅助审查员验证聚类结果，并采用基于成长曲线的可视化方法

Result: 该协作方法提高了机器人检测工作流程的效率，同时保持了可解释性

Conclusion: 该框架支持MMORPG中可扩展和可问责的机器人监管

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Motivation: 认知科学深刻影响了AI等多个学科，而AI也成为认知研究的重要工具，这种互惠关系促使对两者交叉点进行全面回顾。

Method: 通过综合AI和认知科学两个视角的关键贡献，分析当前发展状况并提出未来方向。

Result: 观察到AI进展主要强调实际任务性能，但其认知基础在概念上仍然分散。

Conclusion: AI在认知科学中的未来不仅在于提高性能，更在于构建能加深理解人类心智的系统，包括与认知框架对齐、具身化与文化情境、个性化认知模型以及通过认知共同评估重新思考AI伦理等有前景的方向。

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics
through cognitive co-evaluation.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于"重写-解决-评审-修订"逻辑链的协作式LLM代理框架，通过三个推理LLM（顾问、评审员、程序员）协同工作，显著提高了科学计算问题的代码生成质量和执行成功率。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学计算领域展现强大潜力，但单模型在代码生成和执行方面存在bug率高、非物理解决方案等问题，需要更可靠的自主代码生成框架。

Method: 构建包含顾问、评审员、程序员三个模块的协作代理框架：顾问负责知识转移和问题重写，程序员生成和执行代码，评审员通过运行时反馈进行自我调试和精炼，实现端到端的迭代修订机制。

Result: 该框架在求解PDE、病态线性系统和数据驱动物理分析问题上显著提高了无bug代码生成率，减少了非物理解的出现，提升了最新推理模型的平均执行成功率。

Conclusion: 该代理框架建立了基于自然语言描述的自动代码生成和评审机制，为科学计算提供了一个高度可靠的新范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

### [20] [Single Agent Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning for Bus Fleet Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20784)
*Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种单代理强化学习框架，通过状态空间增强和结构化奖励函数，有效解决公交车拥挤问题，避免了多代理学习的数据不平衡和收敛困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多代理强化学习方法在环线设置中忽视了实际运营的异构路线、时刻表、波动需求和变化车队规模等现实特征，存在数据不平衡和收敛困难。

Method: 构建双向时刻表网络和动态乘客需求模型，通过在数值特征（间隔时间、占用率、速度）基础上增加分类标识符（车辆ID、站点ID、时间段）来扩展状态空间，将多代理问题重构为单代理问题。设计了与运营目标一致的结构化奖励函数，以山脊形奖励代替指数惩罚来平衡均匀间隔和时刻表遵循。

Result: 实验结果显示，修改的软性演绎员-评判者（SAC）算法比对照方法（如MADDPG）表现更稳定且优异，在随机条件下奖励值从-530k提升到-430k。

Conclusion: 通过分类结构化和时刻表感知奖励的增强，单代理深度强化学习可以在非环线实际环境中有效管理公交车持续时间控制，为MARL框架提供了健壮可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

Motivation: 解决手动编写测试集的覆盖面不足问题，构建可扩展、可动态生成的医疗指南测试框架

Method: 将WHO IMCI手册转换为有200+节点、300+边的有向图，通过图遍历生成包含年龄特定场景和上下文干扰项的问题

Result: 模型在症状识别上表现良好(45-67%准确率)，但在症状分级、治疗协议和随访养护方面遇到困难，显示了通用测试没有发现的能力缺口

Conclusion: 图谱方法有效解决了手动编写测试集的覆盖限制，为构建可扩展、可动态生成的全面测试框架提供了方向

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗行业人员排班面临患者负荷波动、临床技能多样性和成本控制的挑战，需要平衡竞争性目标：最小化工资支出、确保充足人员配置、满足员工偏好以防止倦怠

Method: 使用多目标遗传算法(MOO-GA)，将医院单元人员排班建模为多目标优化问题，包含小时预约驱动需求和模块化班次等现实复杂性，定义成本、患者护理覆盖和员工满意度三个目标函数

Result: 在典型医院单元数据集上测试，MOO-GA生成稳健平衡的排班方案，相比模拟传统手动排班的基线方法，平均性能提升66%

Conclusion: 该方法有效管理关键运营目标和员工中心目标之间的权衡，为护士管理者和医院管理者提供实用的决策支持工具

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Result: 在数独基准测试的三个变体上训练时间显著少于其他混合方法；在视觉最小割/最大割任务上优化后悔度优于专用损失函数；能够有效学习蛋白质设计的能量优化公式

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地从自然输入学习解决NP难推理问题，具有可扩展的训练和精确推理能力，在多个实际应用中表现出色

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球有3600多万人受药物使用障碍影响，但由于污名化、动机障碍和个性化支持有限，很少人获得有效治疗。现有语言模型系统缺乏与临床验证策略的紧密整合，限制了在成瘾康复中的效果。

Method: 构建多智能体对话框架ChatThero，结合动态患者建模、情境敏感治疗对话和基于CBT、MI的适应性说服策略。使用包含简单、中等、困难抵抗级别的高保真合成基准，采用监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)的两阶段训练流程。

Result: ChatThero使患者动机平均提升41.5%，治疗信心增加0.49%，在困难案例中比GPT-4o少用26%的对话轮次。自动和人工临床评估均显示其在同理心、响应性和行为真实性方面评分更高。

Conclusion: 该框架支持严格、隐私保护的治疗对话研究，为研究和临床转化提供了稳健、可复现的基础。

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and

Motivation: 紧凑语言模型（如0.5B参数）在强化学习中由于推理能力差导致奖励稀疏和训练不稳定，难以实现智能RAG行为。

Method: Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO)，包括从教师演示的冷启动初始化和策略优化过程中的持续教师指导。

Result: DGPO使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的智能搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至优于更大的教师模型。

Conclusion: DGPO使得在计算资源受限的环境中实现智能RAG成为可能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其可能生成有害回复的风险引发了社会关注。政府发布的伦理指南多为高层级要求，缺乏具体可操作的测试方法。

Method: GUARD方法通过自动化生成违反指南的问题来测试LLM响应合规性，并集成越狱诊断(GUARD-JD)来创建可能绕过安全机制的场景。

Result: 在7个LLM上实证验证有效，包括Vicuna-13B、GPT系列等模型，测试了三个政府指南的合规性并进行了越狱诊断。

Conclusion: GUARD能够有效将高层级伦理指南转化为具体测试问题，提供合规性报告，并可扩展到视觉语言模型，促进可靠LLM应用的发展。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [30] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JERR是一个通过图推理增强大语言模型长文本理解能力的新框架，包含摘要提取、图构建和关系推理三个核心组件，在ROUGE和F1指标上优于所有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在处理长文本时面临的内存限制、复杂推理能力不足、缺乏透明度和容易产生幻觉等问题。

Method: 采用三步法：1）策略性文本分块提取摘要；2）构建有向无环图消除冗余；3）结合蒙特卡洛树搜索进行复杂推理路径导航。

Result: 在ROUGE和F1指标上 consistently outperforms所有基线方法，在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分数。

Conclusion: JERR框架为大语言模型处理长文本和复杂推理任务提供了可靠且透明的解决方案，显著提升了模型的长文本理解能力。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源，通过两阶段后训练框架提升LLM的长链式思维推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长链式思维能力依赖人工精选的高质量数据集，成本高且可扩展性差，需要找到替代方案

Method: 使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源，采用两阶段后训练：1）基于拒绝采样的长链式思维有监精调；2）细粒度奖励设计的强化学习

Result: Graph-R1-7B模型在数学、编程、STEM和逻辑任务上显示出强大的沿用性，在NP难图论问题上的准确性和推理效率均超过QwQ-32B

Conclusion: NP难图论问题作为一种高效且可扩展的资源，为LLM的长链式思维推理能力提升开启了新方向

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

TL;DR: 提出了首个上下文感知人格评估框架CAPE，通过引入对话历史来评估LLM的行为特质，发现上下文增强了响应一致性但也导致人格偏移，不同模型对上下文依赖程度不同


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理测量测试采用无上下文方法，忽略了真实应用中对话历史对响应的影响，需要开发上下文感知的评估框架

Method: 提出CAPE框架，引入对话历史作为上下文，设计新指标量化LLM响应一致性，在7个LLM上进行实验分析

Result: 对话历史通过上下文学习增强响应一致性，但导致人格偏移；GPT模型对问题顺序稳健，Gemini和Llama对上下文敏感；角色扮演代理中上下文依赖的人格偏移改善一致性并与人类判断更一致

Conclusion: 上下文在LLM人格评估中起关键作用，CAPE框架为更真实的心理测量评估提供了新视角，有助于理解LLM行为特质的动态变化

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [33] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现推理步骤中的条件熵变化模式与答案正确性相关：熵递减通常对应正确答案，熵平坦或递增则往往导致错误答案。错误推理路径通常更长，表明更长推理不一定更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少探讨推理步骤对最终答案正确性的实际贡献。由于自回归生成的随机性，生成更多上下文并不保证答案置信度提升，需要预测推理步骤的有效性以实现早期停止或修剪无效步骤。

Method: 在MATH数据集上进行oracle研究，使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成推理链，然后用Qwen3-8B量化推理链对最终准确性的效用。通过条件熵（词汇表上的期望负对数似然）逐步测量模型对答案跨度的不确定性。

Result: 发现条件熵随步骤递减的模式与正确答案强相关，而平坦或递增的熵往往导致错误答案。错误推理路径通常比正确路径更长，表明更长推理不一定产生更好结果。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计高效推理管道奠定了基础，可早期检测和避免无效推理，启发未来工作开发能够预测推理步骤效用的方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

TL;DR: DentalBench是首个针对牙科领域的双语基准测试，包含问答数据集和大规模语料库，用于评估和提升LLMs在牙科专业领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学大模型在牙科等专业医学领域的能力尚未充分探索，缺乏针对性的评估资源，需要专门的基准测试来推动领域发展。

Method: 构建DentalBench基准，包含DentalQA（36,597个中英文问答问题，覆盖4个任务和16个牙科子领域）和DentalCorpus（3.37亿token的大规模高质量语料库），评估14个LLMs并进行领域适应实验。

Result: 评估显示不同模型在任务类型和语言上存在显著性能差距，领域适应（特别是对Qwen-2.5-3B）显著提升了模型在知识密集和术语相关任务上的表现。

Conclusion: 领域特定的基准测试对于开发可信赖且有效的医疗应用LLMs至关重要，DentalBench为牙科领域的LLM发展提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

TL;DR: KG-CQR是一个基于知识图谱的上下文查询检索框架，通过提取和补全相关KG子图来丰富查询表示，在RAG系统中显著提升检索效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决语料库级别的上下文丢失问题，但缺乏对复杂查询的结构化关系表示和语义丰富化处理

Method: 提出包含子图提取、补全和上下文生成三个模块的模型无关框架，通过知识图谱增强查询的上下文表示

Result: 在RAGBench和MultiHop-RAG数据集上实现mAP提升4-6%，Recall@25提升2-3%，在多跳问答任务中持续优于基线模型

Conclusion: KG-CQR通过知识图谱的语义丰富化有效提升了RAG系统的检索性能，且具有良好的可扩展性和模型无关性

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

Conclusion: 该研究填补了当前LLM评测在垂直行业领域的空白，为民航维修领域的目标改进提供了基础，有助于推动更智能化解决方案的发展。

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注结构化电子病历数据，忽略了自由文本笔记中的宝贵临床信息，且未充分利用结构化数据中的文本信息潜力。需要开发能够整合多模态电子病历数据的预测模型。

Method: 使用两个真实世界电子病历数据集，开发并评估基于自然语言处理技术的深度学习框架，包含医疗提示、自由文本和预训练句子编码器三个关键组件，并进行消融研究和数据损坏鲁棒性测试。

Result: 在三个临床任务上，模型性能显著提升：死亡率预测BACC/AUROC提高1.6%/0.8%，住院时间预测RMSE/MAE降低0.5%/2.2%，手术时长估计RMSE/MAE降低10.9%/11.0%，在不同损坏率下均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架是预测重症监护死亡率和资源利用率的有效准确方法，展示了使用提示学习和变压器编码器分析多模态电子病历的成功，对结构化数据损坏具有强韧性，特别是在高损坏水平下。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

Motivation: 阴谋论侵蚀公众对科学和机构的信任，且随着AI生成的虚假信息日益复杂，理解阴谋论内容的修辞模式对于开发干预措施和评估AI漏洞至关重要。

Method: 引入ConspirED数据集，基于CONSPIR认知框架标注在线阴谋论文章的多句摘录；开发计算模型识别阴谋论特征；评估大语言模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现大语言模型在处理阴谋论内容时会产生与输入推理模式相似的输出，即使能够成功处理类似的事实核查虚假信息。

Conclusion: ConspirED是第一个标注阴谋论内容一般认知特征的数据集，揭示了AI模型在处理阴谋论内容时的对齐问题，为干预措施开发提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

Result: 发现许多翻译质量低于声称标准，源句子过于领域特定且偏向英语世界文化，简单启发式方法可获得不错的BLEU分数，高质量MT模型在FLORES+上表现差但在领域相关评估集上表现好。

Conclusion: 建议使用领域通用和文化中立的源文本，减少对命名实体的依赖，以更好地反映真实世界的翻译挑战。

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

TL;DR: SciTopic是一种基于大语言模型增强的科学文献主题发现方法，通过构建文本编码器、空间优化模块和对比学习微调，显著提升了科学主题识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主题发现方法主要依赖词嵌入技术，缺乏对科学文献的全面理解，难以处理复杂的高维文本关系。大语言模型在文本理解方面的卓越能力为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 1) 构建文本编码器捕获科学文献内容；2) 集成基于熵的采样和LLM指导的三元组任务的空间优化模块；3) 基于LLM指导微调文本编码器，优化三元组对比损失；4) 在三个真实数据集上进行实验验证。

Conclusion: SciTopic通过利用大语言模型的强大文本理解能力，有效提升了科学文献主题发现的性能，为研究者提供了更好的科学信息检索和分析工具。

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习实验主要关注标签的多样性，而忽视了语言域（输入）的多样性，这在NLP中很重要。需要一个综合的多域非IID场景测试框架。

Method: 提出了一套综合的多域非IID场景和统一的基准测试框架，设计了适配式联邦蓄米（AdaFD）框架来处理同构和异构设置下的多域非IID挑战。

Result: 实验结果表明，模型能够捐描局部客户端的多样性，与现有工作相比获得了更好的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为联邦学习提供了一个更现实的多域非IID测试环境，AdaFD框架能够有效处理NLP中的输入多样性问题，提高模型在真实环境下的表现。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Conclusion: 生成模型在工业级查询驱动文本摘要任务中具有显著优势，提出的轻量级框架在性能和部署效率方面都表现出色，为实时网络搜索应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答面临数据稀疏性挑战，导致语言模型容易学习虚假模式。现有方法主要关注简单问题生成，忽视了文档中相关句子的知识整合。

Method: KCS将知识组合选择建模为句子级条件预测任务，使用概率对比损失预测下一个最相关的知识片段，在推理时采用随机解码策略平衡准确性和多样性。

Result: KCS在知识组合选择准确率上比基线方法提升3.9%，在HotpotQA和2WikiMultihopQA数据集上的数据增强应用取得了改进。

Conclusion: KCS框架通过有效的知识组合采样，成功提升了多跳问答问题的多样性和质量，为解决数据稀疏性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

Method: 提出CLEGR基准，通过合成图生成流程配合需要结构和语义聚合理解的问题，对代表性GLM架构进行全面评测

Result: 发现soft-prompted LLM基线模型与包含GNN的GLM表现相似，GLM在需要结构理解的任务中表现显著退步

Conclusion: 当前GLM在图结构理解能力上存在显著缺陷，CLEGR基准为推进多模态理解研究提供了基础

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

Motivation: ASR系统在识别领域特定命名实体时常出错，导致下游任务的恶性失败。现有的命名实体编辑模型主要依靠语音编辑距离，在词形差异较大时无法准确定位错误词汇。

Method: 提出了一种新的NEC方法，利用语音声音特征来检索候选实体，然后设计了生成式方法来标注ASR识别结果中的实体错误并替换为正确实体。

Result: 在开源和自建测试集上的实验结果显示，该方法能够显著提高实体识别的准确性，尤其在词形差异较大的场景下效果明显。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的命名实体编辑方法，能够处理传统语音编辑距离方法无法处理的词形差异情况，并将开源自建测试集和训练数据。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型提升了文本生成能力，但也带来了隐写术质量提升和水印保护需求。分词不一致性会破坏系统鲁棒性，需要针对性解决方案。

Method: 通过分析发现导致分词不一致的token具有低频性和临时性特征，提出了逐步验证方法（针对隐写术）和后验回滚方法（针对水印技术）来消除分词不一致性。

Result: 实验表明：1）与传统消歧方法相比，直接处理分词不一致性提升了隐写术的流畅性、不可感知性和抗隐写分析能力；2）水印技术中处理分词不一致性增强了可检测性和抗攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 针对分词不一致性的专门解决方案能有效提升文本隐写和水印系统的性能，为大型语言模型的安全应用提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

Motivation: 当前的长链思维(CoT)方法存在局限性，需要开发能够自主探索、验证和优化中间步骤的智能体模型，以提升复杂问题解决能力。

Method: 采用三项关键技术：(i)高效的RL基础设施和可靠的Python代码环境；(ii)GRPO-RoC算法，通过重采样校正策略处理代码工具的环境噪声；(iii)从非推理SFT开始的多阶段RL训练配方。

Result: 在仅510个RL步骤和一周训练时间内，将预训练的14B模型提升到SOTA水平，在数学推理任务上表现优异，同时在对齐、科学推理和工具使用任务上展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent证明了智能体强化学习在有限计算资源下训练高性能推理模型的有效性，为开发更先进的认知能力提供了可行路径。

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了DP-ST方法，利用语义三元组在本地差分隐私下实现邻域感知的私有文档生成，通过分治策略和LLM后处理在较低ε值下平衡隐私与效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本地差分隐私文本处理需要在极高ε值下才能获得合理效果，隐私保护需求与文本实用性之间存在严重冲突，需要寻找新的解决方案。

Method: 采用语义三元组进行文档分解，结合分治策略和邻域限制的DP概念，使用LLM进行后处理生成连贯文本。

Result: 该方法在较低ε值下仍能生成连贯文本，有效平衡了隐私保护和文本实用性，证明了分治范式和语义连贯性的重要性。

Conclusion: DP-ST方法通过语义分解和LLM后处理，成功在本地差分隐私框架下实现了隐私保护与文本质量的更好平衡，为低ε值下的文本隐私处理提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

Motivation: 隐式仇恨言论（IHS）使用间接语言、讽刺或编码术语表达偏见，难以检测，因为不包含明确的贬损性词语。传统方法需要依赖外部知识或额外信息

Method: 仅通过微调基于大语言模型的通用嵌入模型（Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed、E5），不依赖额外上下文或情感数据

Conclusion: 单纯微调通用LLM嵌入模型就能有效检测隐式仇恨言论，无需复杂的外部知识或额外信息，实现了state-of-the-art性能

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with

sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD是一种自适应的解码方法，通过全局和局部不确定性信号平衡文本生成的连贯性和多样性，同时显著提升生成速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放式文本生成中连贯性与多样性平衡的挑战，现有对比搜索方法存在超参数依赖和计算成本高的问题

Method: 提出GUARD方法，结合全局熵估计和局部熵偏差的'Glocal'不确定性驱动框架，并加入基于token计数的惩罚机制来降低计算开销

Result: 实验表明GUARD在文本多样性和连贯性之间达到良好平衡，生成速度有显著提升，人类和LLM评估者均验证了其优异性能

Conclusion: GUARD通过创新的不确定性驱动框架有效解决了文本生成的连贯性-多样性权衡问题，具有理论保证和实际应用价值

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了真实认知行为治疗对话与LLM生成对话的情感动态差异，发现合成对话在情感变异性、情感语言丰富度和情感反应模式等方面与真实对话存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM生成的心理治疗对话在心理健康NLP中广泛应用，需要验证这些合成对话是否能准确捕捉真实治疗中微妙的情感动态。

Method: 采用Utterance Emotion Dynamics框架分析情感轨迹，比较真实CBT会话（来自公共视频转录）和合成对话（来自CACTUS数据集）在效价、唤醒度和支配度三个维度上的差异。

Result: 合成对话虽然流畅且结构连贯，但在关键情感属性上与真实对话存在差异：真实会话表现出更大的情感变异性、更丰富的情感语言以及更真实的反应和调节模式。真实与合成说话者之间的情感弧相似度较低，特别是客户角色。

Conclusion: 当前LLM生成的治疗数据存在局限性，情感保真度在心理健康应用中至关重要。作者引入了RealCBT数据集来支持未来研究。

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全机制可以通过消除特定表示方向来绕过，需要一种能够增强而非削弱安全对齐的方法

Method: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI) - 对所有残差流写入矩阵应用简单的秩一权重修改，从小规模有害/无害指令对计算所需的安全方向

Result: ROSI持续提高安全拒绝率（Llama Guard 3评估），同时在MMLU、HellaSwag、Arc等标准基准上保持模型实用性，还能重新对齐'未审查'模型

Conclusion: 有针对性的、可解释的权重引导是改善LLM安全的廉价而有效机制，可作为资源密集型微调范式的补充

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Conclusion: 领域适应方法在跨语言和跨语域的认知扭曲检测中显示出最大的应用潜力

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

Result: 在TB-Dense和MATRES两个公开数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: GDLLM框架通过有效捕获全局特征，显著提升了少数关系类的性能并改善了整体学习能力

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统评估多假设信息可从单个源获得或答案短小，而实际应用需要从多个分散源综合信息并生成长文本回复。

Method: 开发了一种可扩展的评测框架，构建了MSRS-Story（故事综合）和MSRS-Meet（会议摘要）两个新的多源检索与综合评测集，并对各种RAG流水线进行了实验。

Result: 实验结果显示生成质量严重依赖于检索效果，而检索效果因任务而异。即使在理想检索条件下，多源综合仍具有挑战性，理论模型在综合步骤上显著超过标准LLM。

Conclusion: 这项研究为复杂的多源信息综合任务提供了丰富的评测基准，并证明了检索效果对生成质量的关键影响，以及理论模型在综合任务中的优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化对多语言任务的影响尚未充分研究，特别是在机器翻译领域需要系统评估不同量化技术对多种语言的影响

Method: 使用5个1.7B到70B参数的大语言模型，在55种语言上进行后训练量化评估，比较AWQ、BitsAndBytes、GGUF和AutoRound四种量化技术

Result: 4位量化通常能保持高资源语言的翻译质量，但低资源语言在2位量化下质量显著下降；GGUF变体在2位精度下提供最一致的性能；语言匹配的校准主要在低比特场景下有益

Conclusion: 研究为在量化约束下部署多语言大语言模型提供了实用见解，特别是在低资源设置中，算法选择和模型大小共同决定了量化鲁棒性

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: SageLM为语音到语音大语言模型提供了有效的端到端评估框架，在语义和声学维度上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Result: IRMA在整体通过率上分别比ReAct、Function Calling和Self-Reflection高出16.1%、12.7%和19.1%

Conclusion: IRMA在动态环境中展现出比其他方法更优越的可靠性和一致性，为解决LLM在多轮工具调用对话中的挑战提供了有效方案

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了效率、氡化能力和性能之间的良好平衡，插件模块具有模型无关性、负担轻微的特点，可无缝集成到现有流水线中

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented

framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of

performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

Conclusion: LETHE是一种成本效益高且鲁棒的防御方法，能有效消除LLM后门行为，为实际部署提供可靠保护

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

TL;DR: 结合大型语言模型与符号求解器的神经符号架构，用于自动化税务申报，显著提高准确性并降低部署成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 税务申报需要复杂的规则推理和数值计算，传统方法容易出错且成本高昂，而纯语言模型缺乏审计性和高精度要求

Method: 将文本税务规则翻译为形式逻辑程序，结合智能检索的案例样本，使用LLM进行语义理解，符号求解器进行精确计算

Result: 在SARA数据集上表现优异，系统部署成本远低于现实世界平均税务申报成本，错误率大幅降低

Conclusion: 神经符号架构为提供可靠、经济实惠的税务援助提供了可行方案，有助于实现更公平的税务服务获取

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

TL;DR: CHAIR-DPO方法通过CHAIR指标构建偏好数据，使用DPO直接偏好优化来减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，在多个基准测试上有效降低了幻觉回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)虽然在各种任务上表现出色，但存在严重的幻觉问题，即生成的答案与视觉输入不符。现有方法需要复杂流程构建合成偏好数据且依赖专有模型，因此需要更简单有效的解决方案。

Method: 利用CHAIR指标（原本用于图像字幕幻觉评估）来区分生成答案中的胜者（无幻觉）和败者（有幻觉）样本，然后使用直接偏好优化(DPO)对现成的MLLMs进行微调。

Result: CHAIR-DPO方法在多个幻觉基准测试上显著减少了幻觉答案的数量，证明了基于CHAIR奖励微调MLLMs的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案来对齐MLLMs，减少幻觉问题，且不需要复杂的合成数据生成流程或依赖专有模型。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

TL;DR: 基于Stable Diffusion 3的多模态框架，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜空间，实现了无需涉及成本标注的高效准确图片伪造定位方法，在多个数据集上较现有方法提升12%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图片伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，成本高且无法跟上新一代多模态大模型带来的图片操纷技术挑战。

Method: 利用SD3的多模态处理能力，将高速滤波器提取的图片伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜空间训练，保留SD3提取的丰富语义信息。

Result: 在广泛使用的标准数据集上实现了较现有最佳方法12%的性能提升，对训练未见的真实文档伪造和自然场景图片也表现出强劲的防伪性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了依赖人工标注数据的问题，为应对新一代多模态大模型带来的图片伪造挑战提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

Motivation: 虽然AI模型在皮肤病诊断中取得显著成功，但模型预测的可解释性仍需大幅提升才能应用于临床实践。

Method: 组合多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)和量化属性方法，通过微调MLLMs从图像预测属性值，并使用SLICE-3D数据集进行属性特异内容基于图像检索案例研究。

Result: 证据表明MLLM嵌入空间可以基于量化属性进行基础化，为提供更可解释的诊断预测奠定基础。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型与量化属性的结合为提升AI皮肤病诊断模型的可解释性提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformer的统一框架，结合监督、自监督和重建目标，用于自动调制识别，在低标签数据情况下表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方法依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量级卷积解码器和线性分类器的统一框架，通过重建分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，在微调中使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签情况下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR级别下保持强劲性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

Motivation: 现有的音频驱动人体动画方法在生成高分辨率、长时间视频时存在身份漂移、颜色偏移、场景不稳定和手部运动建模不佳等问题，需要一种能够保持外观一致性和自然手部动作的解决方案。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导的细化器逐步细化为高分辨率视频；利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移；引入基于高质量手部运动数据训练的手部特定奖励机制。

Result: 在EMTD和HDTF数据集上的实验表明，InfinityHuman在视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步方面达到了最先进的性能，消融研究证实了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过姿态引导的细化策略和手部奖励机制，成功解决了音频驱动人体动画中的关键挑战，能够生成高质量、长时间、外观一致的动画视频。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了用于360度视频显著性预测的新数据集YT360-EyeTracking和两个基于视觉transformer的模型SalViT360和SalViT360-AV，通过整合空间音频线索显著提升了全景视频中观众注意力预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对360度环境中缺乏全面的视听显著性预测数据集的问题，以及球形失真和空间音频整合的复杂性，研究旨在探索如何利用视听线索有效预测360度视频中的视觉显著性。

Method: 构建了包含81个ODV的YT360-EyeTracking数据集，提出了基于视觉transformer的SalViT360框架（具有球形几何感知的时空注意力层）和SalViT360-AV模型（进一步整合了基于音频输入的transformer适配器）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括YT360-EyeTracking）上的实验结果表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中观众注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于准确预测全景视频中的显著性至关重要，这为360度视频的显著性预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标（如准确率、IoU、mAP），而可解释性研究相对不足。现有xAI方法多为样本级解释，缺乏对模型在大型数据集上整体行为的理解，这对于防止偏见判断和识别模型模式至关重要。

Method: 提出一个基于视觉语言模型的pipeline，能够在样本级和数据集级两个层面解释视觉模型的行为。该pipeline可以自动发现模型的失败案例，并以最小的工作量获得对视觉模型的深入理解。

Result: 开发了一个集成视觉模型开发和xAI分析的pipeline，能够有效解释视觉模型在通用图像上的行为模式，帮助识别模型的趋势和潜在偏见。

Conclusion: 该研究将视觉语言模型应用于视觉模型的可解释性分析，提供了一个实用的pipeline来促进图像分析的发展，使模型开发与可解释性分析更好地结合。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于MedNeXt-L-k5的自动化轮空间分割方法，在T2杀像上达到了预期的性能，但在异质性T1杀像数据集上表现中等，并未超过nnU-Net方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割轮空间耗时且中等者间可靠性，现有自动化深度学习模型性能中等且稿性不足，需要开发更高性能的跨数据集分割方法。

Method: 采用Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络MedNeXt-L-k5，分别在同质T2杀像数据集和异质T1杀像数据集上训练模型，并使用5折交叉验证和留一地点交叉验证评估性能。

Result: 在T2杀像上达到百分之80.88的Dice分数（白质），与手动分割可靠性相当；在T1杀像上仅为0.58；在跨地点验证中百分之38（白质）和0.35（基底节），聚簇级别Dice分数为0.61-0.62。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的轮空间自动分割方案，但注意力机制对于PVS分割并非必需，因为它并未超过nnU-Net的性能。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应框架，通过将输出级的补丁级对应关系反馈到中间注意力来增强CLIP的空间一致性，提升开放词汇分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法持续传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互

Method: 训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应框架，将输出预测作为空间一致性先验反馈到中间注意力。设计了注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适应剪枝和适应集成等关键模块，有效反馈输出一致性线索

Result: 该方法作为即插即用模块，无缝集成到四种最先进方法中，在八个基准测试中一致提升性能，支持三种骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H）和多种注意力类型

Conclusion: 通过利用模型输出作为更强的空间一致性先验，有效增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，显著提升了CLIP在开放词汇分割任务中的表现

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在不同层级处理视觉和文本输入的动态过程，揭示了模型的分阶段处理结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务上表现出色，但其内部处理机制仍未被充分探索，需要系统性的分析方法来理解模型如何处理多模态信息。

Method: 训练线性分类器从每个层级的token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并在三种提示变体下评估：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体。

Result: 发现MLLMs存在一致的分阶段结构：早期层进行视觉基础处理，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最后层准备任务特定输出。这种结构在不同视觉分词、指令调优数据和预训练语料下保持稳定，但具体层级分配随基础LLM架构变化。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs的层级组织提供了统一视角，并提供了一个轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SLiCS方法，通过监督字典学习将视觉-语言联合嵌入空间分解为多个概念特定的线性子空间，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言联合嵌入空间（如CLIP）包含丰富的语义信息，但缺乏对复杂场景内容的可解释性分解。作者假设可以通过将嵌入空间解耦为多个概念特定的子空间来更好地理解和管理嵌入信息。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，估计一个线性合成模型，通过稀疏、非负的字典原子组合来表示多标签信息。每个概念特定分量是与标签相关的原子组的非负组合。使用新颖的交替优化算法保证收敛。

Result: SLiCS方法在概念过滤图像检索方面展现出更高的精确度，适用于多种嵌入表示（CLIP、TiTok压缩嵌入、DINOv2自监督嵌入）。定量和定性结果均证实了改进效果。

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间（SLiCS）能够有效解耦视觉-语言联合嵌入空间，为概念过滤的图像检索和条件生成提供更精确的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Motivation: 医疗VLMs虽然为临床应用带来机遇，但存在严重的PHI泄露、数据泄漏和网络安全威胁等安全隐患，特别是在医院环境中尤为关键。

Method: 开发了MedFoundationHub GUI工具包，支持医生无需编程即可选择使用不同模型，工程师可插件式部署Hugging Face开源模型，通过Docker编排实现跨操作系统的隐私保护推理。

Result: 评估了5个最先进的VLM模型，由认证病理学家对结肠和肾脏病例进行1015次评分，发现模型存在脱靶回答、模糊推理和病理术语不一致等局限性。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的解决方案，使医疗VLMs能够在典型学术研究实验室资源下安全部署，同时揭示了当前模型在实际临床应用中存在的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

TL;DR: 提出双向交互Mamba（BIM）模型，通过新颖的扫描机制解决多任务密集预测中交互完整性与计算效率的权衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务密集预测需要充分的跨任务交互，但充分交互往往导致高计算复杂度，现有方法面临交互完整性与计算效率的权衡限制

Method: 引入双向交互扫描（BI-Scan）机制构建任务特定表示作为双向序列，结合任务优先和位置优先扫描模式；采用多尺度扫描（MS-Scan）机制实现多粒度场景建模

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context两个基准测试上展现了优于最先进竞争方法的性能

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制成功解决了多任务密集预测中的交互-效率权衡问题，实现了高效且完整的跨任务信息交互

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Motivation: 现有的可视化编辑方法主要依靠文本指导，在复杂场景中往往无法充分描述，需要额外的非文本编辑提示来提升编辑能力。

Method: 利用预训练的多模态编码器，通过消除音频编码空间与可视编辑模型提示编码空间之间的差异，实现音频指导的可视化编辑。还提出了分离噪音分支和适配性补丁选择来处理复杂的多模态编辑提示场景。

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上进行的综合实验表明，该框架能够通过融合音频的丰富信息来处理复杂编辑场景，而仅依靠文本的方法则无法完成这些任务。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种无需额外训练的音频指导可视化编辑方案，能够有效处理复杂的多模态编辑需求，充分利用音频信息来补充纯文本指导的不足。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架显著推进了多标签分类，取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，有效解决了单正多标签学习中的噪声和准确性挑战

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种延迟脉冲方法和时间依赖的积分发放(tdIF)神经元架构，解决了SNN在视觉检测任务中性能不佳的问题，在超低时间步长(5步内)下实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ANN-SNN转换方法在分类任务中表现优异，但在视觉检测任务中性能仍不理想，主要原因是异质脉冲模式导致的残余膜电位问题。

Method: 采用延迟脉冲方法缓解异质脉冲模式问题，并提出tdIF神经元架构，使IF神经元能够根据时间步长的时序动态调整积累和发放行为。

Result: 在目标检测和车道线检测两个关键视觉任务上，该方法超越了当前ANN-SNN转换方法，在超低延迟(5时间步内)下实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: tdIF方法使脉冲具有不同的时间特性，而不仅仅依赖频率表示，能够在更低时间步长下实现更精确的特征表示，同时保持与传统IF神经元相当的能量消耗。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

<details>

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、模糊边缘，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升对小结构和边缘区域的检测精度

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图传播不确定性；提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征的注意力图；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理有效提升了显著目标检测的性能，特别是在复杂场景下的细节保持和边缘清晰度方面

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Conclusion: 多尺度BEV特征生成和处理能有效解决多视角行人检测中的尺度变化挑战，MSMVD方法在该任务上取得了显著的性能提升

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Conclusion: 通过结合双模型权重选择和自我知识蓄簍，该方法克服了传统方法在缩减模型时丢失关键信息的问题，提供了一种高效的医学图像分类解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR点云高精度扫描导致存储和传输开销过大，现有方法将无序点转换为八叉树或水晶结构进行预测编码，但极端的几何细节稀疏性严重阻碍了高效上下文建模，限制了压缩性能和速度。

Method: 提出了两个轻量模块：1）几何重密化模块：对编码后的稀疏几何进行重密化，在更密集尺度提取特征，然后重新稀疏化用于预测编码，避免在极稀疏细节上进行成本昂贵的计算；2）跨尺度特征传播模块：利用多分辨率占位线索来指导层次特征传播，促进跨尺度信息共享，减少冗余特征提取。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了独到的压缩比和实时性能，在12-bit量化下达到编码和解码通过26 FPS的高速度。

Conclusion: 通过集成几何重密化和跨尺度特征传播两个模块，该方法生成了紧凑的特征表示，提供了高效的上下文建模并加速编码过程，为LiDAR点云压缩预测编码领域提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要大量极端案例进行训练验证，但真实世界收集成本高且危险。现有3D高斯溅射和图像生成方法存在视觉保真度有限和姿态控制不精确的问题

Method: 利用编辑对象的3D高斯表示作为密集先验注入去噪过程，采用场景级3D边界框布局重建非目标对象的遮挡区域，并引入层次化细粒度特征指导外观细节

Result: 在Waymo Open Dataset上的实验表明，G^2Editor在统一框架内有效支持物体重定位、插入和删除，在姿态可控性和视觉质量方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶场景生成提供了逼真且精确的物体编辑解决方案，同时有利于下游数据驱动任务

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

Motivation: 胎儿脑部精确分割对评估神经发育至关重要，但如胰体胶体发育不良(CCD)等稀缺病理的注释数据极少，限制了深度学习模型的普适性。

Method: 提出病理知识领域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程，仅从健康数据模拟多样化的脑部变异。

Result: 在248例健康胎儿、26例CCD和47例其他脑部病理的群体中验证，在CCD案例上取得显著改善，同时保持对其他病理的性能。胰体胶体长度估计错误从10.9mm降至0.7mm。

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识结合到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提高对稀缺但临床重要病变的分析能力。

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Motivation: 传统语音识别系统对听障人士不可用，而现有的视觉替代方案（手语和唇读）通常被孤立研究，缺乏统一的整合框架来探索多模态协同效应。

Method: 设计了一个统一的模态无关架构，能够有效处理异构输入，特别探索了唇部运动作为非手动线索在手语理解中的作用。

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR等多个任务上达到或优于最先进的专用模型性能，发现显式建模唇部运动能显著提升手语翻译性能。

Conclusion: 该统一框架成功整合了多种通信模态，证明了多模态协同的有效性，特别是唇部运动信息对手语理解的重要补充作用。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过多轮迭代推理和端到端训练，显著提升了长视频理解性能，推动了该领域的技术发展。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Result: 在多个数据集和域偏移类型上的广泛实验表明DUO优于现有方法

Conclusion: DUO框架通过联合最小化语义和几何不确定性，显著提升了单目3D目标检测在域偏移条件下的鲁棒性和可靠性

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，显著降低了误报率。

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效融合2D和3D专家知识，提升了工业表面异常检测的实用价值。

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit框架通过重新定义编辑任务，克服了指令数据集质量限制，具有更好的可扩展性和编辑性能。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

Motivation: 持续测试时适应中，模型仅依赖目标域特征容易导致混淆和学习偏差，现有方法生成的伪标签质量无法保证且存在误差累积问题

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据特征解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，保持子特征与整体特征的一致性；设置自适应阈值计算样本置信度进行加权自监督学习

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上验证了方法的有效性，在持续测试时适应场景中表现一致

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过特征解耦和置信度加权学习，有效减少了伪标签噪声并缓解了误差累积问题，提升了持续测试时适应的性能

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Motivation: 相机标定质量对新视角合成致关重要，1像素错误就会对重建质量产生显著影响，而真实场景缺乏真实标定数据

Method: 利用3DGS模型，通过回传新视角颜色损失对相机参数进行精细调整，以优化标定结果

Result: 在3DGS参考数据集上，新的标定方法平均提升了0.4 dB PSNR

Conclusion: 虽然精细调整可能耗时较长，但对于重要场景的标定（如Mip-NeRF 360），新视角质量的提升价值远超过训练时间成本

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过557个模拟实验，系统评估了7种主流域适应技术在自然图像和医学图像分类中的表现，发现DSAN算法在COVID-19等医学数据集上表现优异，准确率达91.2%，在动态数据流场景中相比基线提升6.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 域适应技术能缓解训练集和测试集之间的分布差异，但现有研究多基于自然图像而非医学数据，且主流数据集可能导致性能偏差。本研究旨在深入理解域适应技术对自然和医学图像的实际效益。

Method: 使用7种广泛应用的域适应技术，在5个自然图像数据集和8个医学图像数据集上进行557个模拟实验，涵盖分布外、动态数据流和有限训练样本等多种场景。

Result: DSAN算法表现突出，在COVID-19数据集上使用Resnet50达到91.2%的分类准确率，在动态数据流场景中相比基线提升6.7%。DSAN在COVID-19和皮肤癌数据集上展现出显著的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对域适应技术的理解，为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，特别推荐DSAN算法用于医学图像分类任务。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡等图像退化问题，现有方法通过特征聚合和复杂后处理提升性能但计算成本高，需要在不增加推理负担的情况下提高鲁棒性

Method: 1) 使用对比损失实现对比学习辅助分支来增强主干网络特征表示能力；2) 提出动态损失加权策略，训练早期强调辅助特征学习，后期逐渐侧重检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现了CNN模型的最先进性能，无需额外后处理方法

Conclusion: CLAB方法通过简单的对比学习辅助分支和动态加权策略，有效提升了视频目标检测的鲁棒性和性能，且不增加推理时的计算负担

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为，发现特定注意力头负责提取排版信息，并提出了一种无需微调的选择性消融防御方法，显著提升了模型对排版攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在此类攻击下的行为并开发有效防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型后半层中专用于提取和传输排版信息的注意力头，构建排版电路，通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御攻击，无需微调。

Result: 该方法在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降不到1%。无需训练的防御方法与当前最先进的基于微调的方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列抗排版攻击的"阅读障碍"CLIP模型，可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

TL;DR: FastFit是一个基于可缓存扩散架构的高速多参考虚拟试穿框架，通过半注意力机制和类别嵌入技术，实现了参考特征的单次计算和多步复用，平均速度提升3.5倍，并在多个数据集上达到最先进的保真度指标。

Motivation: 当前虚拟试穿技术面临两大挑战：无法支持多参考服装组合（包括服装和配饰），以及在每个去噪步骤中重复计算参考特征导致效率低下。

Method: 提出FastFit框架，采用半注意力机制和用类别嵌入替代传统时间步嵌入，实现参考特征编码与去噪过程的完全解耦，参考特征只需计算一次即可在所有步骤中无损复用。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和新建的DressCode-MR数据集上，FastFit在关键保真度指标上超越最先进方法，同时实现平均3.5倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的可缓存扩散架构成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和性能问题，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了新的解决方案和数据集支持。

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Conclusion: 热成像和事件相机的融合能有效解决低光照环境下交通标志识别的挑战，提升自动驾驶系统的语义理解安全性

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Conclusion: 提出的主动防御方法通过低频扰动有效破坏了深度伪造生成过程，为对抗深度伪造技术提供了新的主动防御思路，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有数据重构攻击在深层模型上的局限性，显示了在分布式推理环境中的严重隐私风险。

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,

*Yuxi Hu,Jun Zhang,Kuangyi Chen,Zhe Zhang,Friedrich Fraundorfer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C3-GS是一个用于通用高斯溅射的框架，通过上下文感知、跨维度和跨尺度约束增强特征学习，实现无需逐场景优化的高质量新视图合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在编码判别性、多视图一致特征方面存在不足，难以从稀疏输入视图中构建准确的几何结构。

Method: 在统一渲染管道中集成三个轻量级模块，引入上下文感知、跨维度和跨尺度约束来改进特征融合。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了C3-GS实现了最先进的渲染质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现逼真的合成效果，且无需额外的监督，代码已开源。

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

TL;DR: EmoCAST是一个基于扩散模型的文本驱动情感说话头生成框架，通过解耦情感模块和情感音频注意力模块实现精确的情感合成和音频同步，在真实数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感说话头合成方法在控制灵活性、运动自然度和表情质量方面存在局限，且实验室收集的数据集限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 提出扩散框架EmoCAST，包含文本引导解耦情感模块增强空间情感理解，情感音频注意力模块捕捉情感与音频的交互，并构建情感数据集配合情感感知采样和渐进功能训练策略。

Result: EmoCAST在生成真实、情感丰富且音频同步的说话头视频方面实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的模块设计和训练策略，有效解决了情感说话头合成中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

*Jiawen Lin,Shiran Bian,Yihang Zhu,Wenbin Tan,Yachao Zhang,Yuan Xie,Yanyun Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个新颖的零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角真实场景图像和空间信息进行目标物体推理，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有零样本3D视觉定位方法面临的单视角定位依赖导致的空间推理受限、上下文遗漏和细节退化等问题，推动3DVG向更大泛化性和实际应用性发展。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案并进行语义过滤；然后采用提案引导的多视角投影策略将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列；最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM通过多视角空间信息利用和动态调度机制，有效解决了零样本3D视觉定位中的关键挑战，推动了该技术向实际应用的发展。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是女性癌症相关死亡的主要原因，早期检测对改善预后至关重要。MRI对高风险或致密乳腺组织女性的癌症检测具有高敏感性，但需要AI解决方案来支持临床诊断

Method: 开发基于SwinUNETR的深度学习框架，包含乳腺区域掩码、广泛数据增强和集成学习技术，使用多中心511个研究的数据集

Result: 在ODELIA联盟组织的多中心挑战中获得第二名，证明了该方法在临床乳腺MRI解读中的潜力

Conclusion: 该方法展现了良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力，代码已公开分享，有望支持乳腺癌的临床诊断工作

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估了CLIP视觉语言模型在军事车辆识别任务中对遮挡的鲁棒性，发现Transformer架构优于CNN，分散遮挡比连续遮挡影响更大，并通过微调显著提升了模型抗遮挡能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等视觉语言模型在缺乏标注数据的国防应用中具有优势，但其在军事环境中面对部分遮挡和信噪比下降等挑战时的鲁棒性尚未充分研究

Method: 使用包含18类军事车辆的自定义数据集，通过归一化曲线下面积(NAUC)评估不同CLIP变体在不同遮挡比例下的性能，比较了Transformer和CNN架构，并进行了线性探测和骨干网络微调实验

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP consistently outperform CNNs, 2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, 3) performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around 35% occlusion, 4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop occurs at more than 60% occlusion

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在训练过程中加入遮挡特定增强的重要性，以及需要进一步探索补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以实现CLIP在现实世界中的部署

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarBack是一个即插即用的3D高斯头像重建框架，通过生成身份一致的后视图伪图像和自适应空间对齐策略，解决了现有方法因依赖前视图图像而导致后脑重建质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的头像重建方法主要依赖前视图图像，导致后脑区域重建质量差，存在几何不一致、结构模糊和真实感降低等问题，限制了重建头像的保真度。

Method: 提出AvatarBack框架，包含两个核心技术：1）特定主体生成器（SSG）利用生成先验从稀疏前视图输入合成身份一致的后视图伪图像；2）自适应空间对齐策略（ASA）使用可学习变换矩阵优化合成视图与3D高斯表示之间的几何对齐。

Result: 在NeRSemble和K-hairstyle数据集上的实验表明，AvatarBack显著提升了后脑重建质量，同时保持了前视图保真度，重建的头像在不同运动下保持一致的视觉真实感且完全可动画化。

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过显式建模缺失的后脑区域，成功解决了3D高斯头像重建中的后脑质量问题，为完整且一致的3D头像重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Conclusion: 该架构通过Swin Transformer和跳跃连接的有效结合，显著提升了自动驾驶模型的性能表现，后续将通过消融研究验证各组件贡献。

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Result: 实证结果显示该方法显著优于传统方法，有效减少幻觉、增强安全性并提升整体能力

Conclusion: 该方法为LVLMs对齐提供了更有效的解决方案，实现了自主改进多模态对齐的目标

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机器在视频内容的具体实体识别方面取得了显著进展，但在抽象概念（如正义、自由、团结等）理解方面仍落后于人类。抽象概念识别是视频理解领域的关键开放挑战，需要基于上下文信息进行多层次的语义推理。

Method: 本文采用综述研究方法，系统研究了用于理解视频中抽象概念的不同任务和数据集，分析了研究人员在不同时期利用当时可用工具解决这些任务的尝试。

Result: 研究发现基础模型的近期进展为解决视频中的抽象概念理解提供了理想条件。自动理解高级抽象概念对于使模型更符合人类推理和价值观至关重要。

Conclusion: 作者主张借鉴数十年的社区经验将有助于阐明这一重要的开放重大挑战，并在多模态基础模型时代重新审视时避免"重复发明轮子"。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在极端艺术风格转换（如涂鸦）中保持面部身份识别性的挑战，避免因风格化导致的面部特征失真，从而保持个人和文化真实性。

Method: 采用端到端文本引导框架：1）使用LoRA微调的预训练扩散transformer进行涂鸦风格迁移；2）通过面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入；3）使用CLIP引导的提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制；4）采用"风格优先、身份保持"的范式。

Result: 定量结果显示竞争性的面部特征一致性和最先进的美学评分，在人类偏好评分中表现优异。定性分析和在Cruilla Festival的现场部署验证了系统的实际创作影响力。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术创作目标，为创造性AI应用中融合风格自由和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分组合出新含义。虽然视觉语言模型（VLMs）取得了显著进展，但有证据表明它们在组合语义方面存在困难，例如无法正确绑定属性和对象。

Method: 评估了三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下绑定对象属性和关系的能力。通过分析嵌入表示来探究模型困难的原因。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都面临显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，困难可能源于关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似。

Conclusion: 扩散分类器在某些组合任务上表现优于CLIP，但所有VLMs在关系推理方面都存在根本性挑战，需要进一步改进关系概念的表示学习。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出动态视频压缩框架，通过可变编码路径实现变比特率控制，在保持RD性能的同时实现精确的比特率控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经视频压缩虽然性能优异，但学习型编解码器在精确比特率控制方面存在固有局限，需要解决变比特率场景下的控制问题。

Method: 提出动态路由自编码器（DRA）具有可变编码路径，每条路径占用部分计算复杂度并对应不同的RD权衡；使用速率控制代理实时估计比特率并调整编码路径；采用联合路径优化策略实现多路径协同训练。

Result: 在HEVC和UVG数据集上，相比最先进方法平均BD-Rate降低14.8%，BD-PSNR增益0.47dB，平均比特率误差仅为1.66%。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了速率-失真-复杂度优化（RDCO），适用于各种比特率和比特率受限的应用场景，为神经视频压缩提供了有效的变比特率控制解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的面元位姿学习回归方法能够有效处理点云配准中的方向和不确定性问题，在真实点云扫描数据上表现出色。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于点式奖励模型的T2I生成方法容易受到奖励破解影响，微小分数差异经过归一化后被放大，导致模型过度优化琐碎增益，破坏生成稳定性

Method: Pref-GRPO使用成对偏好奖励方法，在每组图像内进行成对比较，使用偏好奖励模型的胜率作为奖励信号，将优化目标从分数最大化转向偏好拟合

Result: 实验表明Pref-GRPO能区分细微的图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势并缓解奖励破解。UniGenBench基准揭示了开源和闭源T2I模型的优缺点

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO方法通过成对偏好奖励机制有效解决了奖励破解问题，UniGenBench为T2I模型提供了更全面的评估框架

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Result: 实验显示先前检测器在跨模型场景中泛化良好，但在未见伪造技术和数据域上表现不足。Veritas在不同OOD场景中取得显著提升，并能提供透明可信的检测输出

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集和Veritas检测器有效解决了深度伪造检测在真实世界中的泛化挑战，为实际部署提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Result: 实验显示FakeParts使人类检测准确率下降超过30%，现有最先进检测模型也出现类似性能下降，证实了当前检测方法的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测方法在部分视频操作方面的紧急漏洞，并为开发更鲁棒的检测方法提供了必要的数据资源。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

Conclusion: 该研究成功将人群计数与图像融合结合，为密集场景下的多模态视觉任务提供了有效的解决方案，证明了多任务学习框架的优越性。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Method: 提出PathMR框架，给定病理图像和文本查询，同时生成专家级诊断解释和预测细胞分布模式，在PathGen数据集和新开发的GADVR数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在两个数据集上的广泛实验表明，PathMR在文本生成质量、分割准确性和跨模态对齐方面始终优于最先进的视觉推理方法。

Conclusion: PathMR有潜力提高AI驱动病理诊断的可解释性，代码将公开可用。

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will
be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于深度学习的双模态成像分析框架，用于早期胰腺导管腺癌检测，在40个患者样本上实现了超过90%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌生存率极低（5年生存率<10%），主要原因是晚期检测。需要开发早期检测方法来改善患者预后。

Method: 使用自荧光和二次谐波生成双模态成像，分析40个患者样本。评估了6种深度学习架构（包括CNN和ViT），最终采用改进的ResNet架构，使用冻结预训练层和类别加权训练来解决数据集小和类别不平衡问题。

Result: 优化后的框架在癌症检测中实现了超过90%的准确率，显著优于当前手动分析方法。

Conclusion: 建立了一个强大的自动化PDAC检测流程，可增强病理学家能力，并为扩展到其他癌症类型奠定基础，同时为小规模医学影像数据集深度学习应用提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

Motivation: 反事实推理已成为可解释和公平AI的核心方法，但需要系统化的框架来发现虚假相关性、探索因果依赖关系，并构建更鲁棒的系统。

Method: 开发了多种方法：CAVLI结合归因和概念级分析；ASAC使用对抗性反事实扰动；TIBET提供可扩展的偏见评估流程；BiasConnect构建因果图；InterMit采用无训练的模块化算法。

Result: 这些方法能够量化模型对可解释概念的依赖程度，提高公平性和准确性，避免刻板印象，并实现对社会负责的偏见评估和缓解。

Conclusion: 反事实推理为判别性和生成性模型中的可解释性、公平性和因果性提供了统一的视角，建立了原则性、可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Method: 提出Dino U-Net架构：使用冻结的DINOv3骨干网络作为编码器，通过专门适配器融合语义特征和空间细节，设计保真度感知投影模块(FAPM)在降维过程中保持表示质量。

Result: 在七个不同的公共医学图像分割数据集上进行广泛实验，Dino U-Net实现了最先进的性能，在各种成像模态上始终优于先前方法，且随着骨干模型规模增大（最高70亿参数），分割准确性持续提升。

Conclusion: 利用通用基础模型的优质密集预训练特征，为提升医学图像分割准确性提供了高效且参数有效的方法。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based

achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized
designs. The new network is named E-ConvNeXt, which can maintain high accuracy
performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network
(CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the
model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental
validation on ImageNet classification demonstrates E-ConvNeXt's superior
accuracy-efficiency balance: E-ConvNeXt-mini reaches 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at
0.9GFLOPs. E-ConvNeXt-small reaches 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs. Transfer

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Motivation: 现有视频加速方法基于图像技术，无法建模时间连贯性，也无法为大规模视频模型提供单步蒸馏，导致采样效率低下。

Method: 采用两阶段蒸馏：1)稳定性预热机制稳定对抗蒸馏；2)统一对抗平衡机制在噪声空间中实现稳定的单步对抗训练。对于条件生成还提出了条件对抗一致性方法。

Result: 在VBench-I2V上平均提升7.15%的语义对齐、时间一致性和帧质量，将预训练模型延迟减少100倍（从1000秒到10秒）。

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的采样效率问题，实现了高质量单步视频生成，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor

physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from

Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)

TL;DR: 提出基于多任务学习的方法来解决组织病理学图像中非典型有丝分裂识别在领域偏移下的性能下降问题，通过辅助任务帮助模型专注于分类目标而忽略变化的背景


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在组织病理学图像中识别非典型有丝分裂对评估肿瘤侵袭性很重要，但机器学习模型在领域偏移下性能显著下降

Method: 采用多任务学习方法，利用与主要分类任务相关的辅助任务，帮助模型专注于分类目标而忽略图像中变化的背景

Result: 在三个不同数据集（MIDOG 2025非典型训练集、Ami-Br数据集和MIDOG25挑战赛初步测试集）上显示出有前景的性能

Conclusion: 多任务学习方法能有效提升模型在领域偏移下的泛化能力，专注于关键特征而减少背景干扰

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this
problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification
task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training
Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25
challenge.

*Huynh Tong Dang Khoa,Dang Hoai Nam,Vo Nguyen Le Duy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FW-GAN是一个单样本手写体合成框架，通过整合相位感知Wave-MLP和频率引导鉴别器，生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，解决了传统方法在长距离依赖和频率信息建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标记手写数据稀缺限制了识别系统的效果，现有合成方法存在两个主要问题：传统卷积架构难以建模长距离依赖和复杂笔画模式，以及忽视频率信息在捕捉细粒度风格细节中的关键作用。

Method: 提出FW-GAN框架，包含：1）集成相位感知Wave-MLP的生成器，更好捕捉空间关系并保留风格线索；2）频率引导鉴别器，利用高频成分增强真实性检测；3）新颖的频率分布损失函数，对齐合成与真实手写的频率特征。

Result: 在越南语和英语手写数据集上的实验表明，FW-GAN能生成高质量、风格一致的手写体，有效增强低资源手写识别(HTR)管道的数据。

Conclusion: FW-GAN通过频率感知的生成对抗网络架构，成功解决了手写体合成中的关键挑战，为低资源手写识别提供了有价值的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

*Junpeng Ma,Qizhe Zhang,Ming Lu,Zhibin Wang,Qiang Zhou,Jun Song,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视频大语言模型的视觉token剪枝方法MMG-Vid，通过分段级和token级的边际收益最大化，在保持99.5%性能的同时减少75%token数量和3.9倍速度提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLLM存在过多视觉token导致计算费用高的问题，现有方法没有充分考虑视频的动态特征和时间依赖性

Method: 提出mmG-Vid框架，首先根据帧相似性分段，动态分配token预算；然后使用时间导向的DPC算法共同建模帧间唯一性和帧内多样性，最大化每个token的边际收益

Result: 实验结果显示MMG-Vid能保持原始性能的99.5%以上，同时有效减少75%视觉token，并在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上将预填充阶段加速3.9倍

Conclusion: MMG-Vid通过最大化边际收益的方法，能够在保持高性能的同时显著提升VLLM的推理效率，为视频理解的实际应用提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogVLA是一个认知对齐的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过指令驱动路由和稀疏化技术，在提高效率的同时提升性能，相比OpenVLA减少2.5倍训练成本和2.8倍推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。受人类多模态协调启发，需要更高效且性能更好的框架。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing将指令信息注入视觉编码器，选择性聚合压缩视觉tokens；2) LFP-Routing在语言模型中引入动作意图，修剪指令无关的视觉tokens；3) V-L-A耦合注意力结合因果视觉-语言注意力和双向动作并行解码。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实机器人任务中分别达到97.4%和70.0%的成功率，实现最先进性能，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐的设计，在保持高性能的同时大幅提升了效率，为视觉-语言-动作模型的实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

TL;DR: 首个数据驱动的多视角3D点跟踪器，使用4个摄像头即可实现稳健的在线3D跟踪，免去了传统方法需要20+摄像头和每序列优化的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目跟踪器深度歧义和遮挡问题，以及传统多摄像头方法需要大量设备和每序列优化的实用性问题

Method: 使用已知摄像机姿态和多视图深度信息，将多视图特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关性和转换器类更新机制来预测3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个真实数据集上分别达到了3.1cm和2.0cm的中位轨迹误差，能够良好地适应1-8个摄像头的不同视角和24-150帧的视频长度

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D跟踪研究设置了新标准，提供了一个实用的实际应用工具，并开源了跟踪器和数据集

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

TL;DR: OneReward是一个统一的强化学习框架，使用单一奖励模型提升多任务生成能力，在图像编辑任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多任务生成模型中不同任务数据分布和评估标准差异大的问题，避免传统方法需要针对每个任务进行监督微调的局限性

Method: 使用单一视觉语言模型作为生成奖励模型，通过多任务强化学习直接训练预训练基础模型，无需任务特定的监督微调

Result: 实验结果表明，统一的编辑模型在多个评估维度上 consistently 优于商业和开源竞争对手

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型进行多任务强化学习的有效性，为多任务生成模型提供了高效的训练方案

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

Abstract: We present Dress&Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high
quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a
user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference
video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops,
bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms
try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning
network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and
videos), thereby enhancing garment registration and motion fidelity. CondNet is
trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a
larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive
manner. Dress&Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions
and enables a high quality and flexible try-on experience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对NeurIPS 2024挑战赛的获胜水印移除方案，包含黑盒和白盒两种攻击方法，实现了95.7%的水印移除率且保持图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试现有水印技术的鲁棒性，研究对抗性攻击对数字媒体水印的破坏效果

Method: 白盒跟踪使用基于VAE的自适应规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB色彩空间恢复；黑盒跟踪通过图像聚类，应用扩散模型和ChatGPT生成的语义先验进行水印移除

Result: 实现了95.7%的近完美水印移除率，对剩余图像质量影响可忽略不计

Conclusion: 该方法成功展示了现有水印技术的脆弱性，希望促进更鲁棒的水印方法发展

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管区块链技术有所进步，但L1区块链节点的运行成本仍然很高，其中状态数据库是最耗资源的组件之一。虽然区块链行业已从分叉链转向无分叉链，但仍在使用不适合无分叉链的传统分叉数据库

Method: 设计了一种专门针对无分叉区块链的数据库方案，优化了状态数据库的管理，包括账户余额、nonce、代码和智能合约持久存储等

Result: 与基于geth的Fantom区块链客户端相比，实现了100倍的存储效率提升和10倍的吞吐量提升

Conclusion: 专门为无分叉区块链设计的数据库方案能够显著提升性能和存储效率，解决了当前区块链节点运行成本高的问题

Abstract: Operating nodes in an L1 blockchain remains costly despite recent advances in
blockchain technology. One of the most resource-intensive components of a node
is the blockchain database, also known as StateDB, that manages balances,
nonce, code, and the persistent storage of accounts/smart contracts. Although
the blockchain industry has transitioned from forking to forkless chains due to
improved consensus protocols, forkless blockchains still rely on legacy forking
databases that are suboptimal for their purposes. In this paper, we propose a
forkless blockchain database, showing a 100x improvement in storage and a 10x
improvement in throughput compared to the geth-based Fantom Blockchain client.

TL;DR: 本文对比分析了三个SQL调用LLM的系统，发现开源解决方案功能有限、性能较差，并提出了结构化输出、资源优化和查询规划三个关键问题的初步解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在数据库系统中的集成日益普遍，企业平台提供了SQL直接调用LLM的功能，但开源解决方案在功能性和性能方面存在显著缺陷，需要进行系统性分析和改进。

Method: 采用对比研究方法，选取两个开源系统和一个企业平台，使用5个代表性查询来测试功能性、性能和可扩展性限制。

Result: 识别了三个主要问题：结构化输出控制、资源利用优化和查询规划改进。实现初步解决方案后观察到了在LLM驱动的SQL查询处理方面的改善。

Conclusion: 更紧密的LLM+DBMS集成是实现可扩展和高效LLM查询处理的关键所在，本文的初步成果为进一步的系统优化提供了方向性指引。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as
text summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated question-answering.
Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management
systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies
such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly
within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However,
open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor
performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source
systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to
expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked
LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs,
optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented
initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL
queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is
the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.

Motivation: 数据已成为跨领域创新的基础资产，关系表上的预测建模日益重要。需要自动化特征增强来识别和利用任务相关的关联信号，减少人工努力

Method: 1) 通过建模表内属性关系捕获语义依赖，将表划分为结构化语义段；2) 构建表示所有段间行关系的异质加权图；3) 使用消息传递图神经网络在图中传播信息，指导特征选择并增强原始数据集

Result: 在10个真实和合成数据集上的大量实验表明，ReCoGNN在分类和回归任务上始终优于现有方法

Conclusion: ReCoGNN框架成功实现了自动化特征增强，能够有效利用多关系表中的语义信息来提升预测模型的性能

Abstract: Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such
as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling
over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on
reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques.
This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be
automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?
  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature
augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features
extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN
first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table
attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured,
semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted
graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally,
ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate
information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the
original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing
methods on both classification and regression tasks.

TL;DR: SpeedMalloc使用轻量级支持核心处理多线程应用的内存分配任务，通过将分配器元数据隔离在专用核心缓存中，减少缓存冲突和跨核心同步开销，相比现有软件和硬件分配器获得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内存分配虽然只占代码的一小部分，但对程序性能有蝴蝶效应般的影响，在多线程多核系统中，分配器元数据与用户数据交织会导致缓存污染和跨线程同步开销。现有的加速器方案对多线程应用支持有限，核心与加速器间同步仍是挑战

Method: 采用轻量级可编程支持核心处理内存分配任务，该核心具有高效的跨核心数据同步能力，将所有分配器元数据存放在自己的缓存中，避免与用户数据产生缓存冲突，无需跨核心元数据同步

Result: 与Jemalloc、TCMalloc、Mimalloc、Mallacc和Memento等先进分配器相比，SpeedMalloc在多线程工作负载上分别实现了1.75倍、1.18倍、1.15倍、1.23倍和1.18倍的加速

Conclusion: SpeedMalloc通过专用支持核心的设计有效解决了多线程内存分配的性能问题，相比专用加速器方案更具通用性，能够适应新的分配器设计，显著提升了多线程应用的性能

Abstract: Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed
code, can have a "butterfly effect" on overall program performance, leading to
significant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately
5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x
performance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from
the complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core
systems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading
to cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.
Offloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a
potential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache
pollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for
multi-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators
remains a significant challenge.
  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory
allocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a
lightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data
synchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This
design minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for
cross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core
instead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting
new allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software
and hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and
Memento. SpeedMalloc achieves 1.75x, 1.18x, 1.15x, 1.23x, and 1.18x speedups on
multithreaded workloads over these five allocators, respectively.

TL;DR: SwizzlePerf是一个利用LLM进行GPU内核性能优化的系统，通过提供硬件感知能力，能够快速生成空间优化模式，相比人工优化效率大幅提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于搜索的LLM性能优化方法缺乏硬件感知能力，而人类性能工程师依赖硬件特性来实现近最优利用率。需要让LLM具备硬件意识来进行软件级优化。

Method: 通过利用工作负载的特定内存访问模式、架构规范、过滤的性能分析日志和历史性能反思，为LLM提供明确的硬件感知能力，自动生成GPU内核的空间优化。

Result: 对于GEMM内核，SwizzlePerf在5分钟内生成专家需要2周才能找到的最优硬件特定swizzling模式。在10个多样化内核测试中，9个内核实现了最高2.06倍加速和70%的L2命中率提升。

Conclusion: 这是系统化创建硬件感知LLM性能工程代理的第一步，展示了LLM在硬件特定优化方面的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance
engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around
runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human
performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization --
hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access
patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections
on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are
tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates
spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving
LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.
  For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same
hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance
engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels,
SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve
up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the
first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM
performance engineering agents.

Motivation: 共享A100集群中延迟敏感型推理常受PCIe结构上的噪声邻居干扰影响，导致尾部延迟增加和服务等级目标(SLO)违规。现有静态资源配置方法无法有效应对这种动态干扰问题。

Method: 开发了结构无关、可虚拟机部署的主机级控制器，结合动态多实例GPU(MIG)重配置、PCIe感知的任务放置策略，以及轻量级防护机制(MPS配额、cgroup I/O控制)。通过采样租户尾部延迟和系统信号，利用拓扑提示避免PCIe热点，并采用停留/冷却机制防止操作抖动。

Result: 在单主机和2节点(16-GPU)集群测试中，SLO违规率降低约32%，p99延迟改善约15%，吞吐量成本≤5%。LLM服务测试显示TTFT p99改善10-15%，成本≤5%。消融实验表明MIG和放置策略贡献相当。

Conclusion: 该控制器能有效缓解PCIe噪声干扰问题，在保持高吞吐量的同时显著改善尾部延迟性能，且无需修改控制器即可适用于LLM服务等不同工作负载。

Abstract: Latency-sensitive inference on shared A100 clusters often suffers
noisy-neighbor interference on the PCIe fabric, inflating tail latency and SLO
violations. We present a fabric-agnostic, VM-deployable host-level controller
that combines dynamic Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) reconfiguration, PCIe-aware
placement, and lightweight guardrails (MPS quotas, cgroup I/O). It samples
per-tenant tails and system signals, uses topology hints to avoid PCIe hot
spots, and gates actions with dwell/cool-down to avoid thrash. On a single host
and a 2-node (16-GPU) cluster, SLO miss-rate is reduced by \(\approx\)32\%
(\(\approx\)1.5) and p99 latency improves \(\approx\)15\% with \(\leq\)5\%
throughput cost versus static MIG and naive placement; ablations show MIG and
placement contribute comparably. We also evaluate LLM serving with vLLM on OLMo
2 7B Instruct: TTFT p99 improves \(\approx\)10--15\% at \(\leq\)5\% cost
without changing the controller.

Motivation: 现有的边缘设备部署策略要么产生大量通信开销，要么在准确性和效率之间做出次优权衡，无法满足实时边缘系统的高质量服务需求。

Method: 利用transformer的可分割性和可集成性，将大型transformer分解为多个小模型进行分布式推理，中间结果聚合生成最终输出。使用DeBo算法解决优化问题并校准分解模型。

Conclusion: CoFormer系统有效解决了边缘设备部署大型transformer模型的挑战，实现了高效、低能耗的分布式推理。

Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment
of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However,
ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant
challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource
requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload
transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models
on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either
considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy
and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative
inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central
idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of
transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple
smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are
aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem
to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous
hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the
optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively
calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the
capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge
devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer
models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6
billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%.
CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while
maintaining satisfactory inference performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有feGRASS方法存在两个主要问题：1）恢复步骤难以并行化（严格数据依赖）2）在偏斜输入上性能下降需要多次处理。需要解决这些可扩展性和性能瓶颈

Method: pdGRASS并行算法，将边组织成无数据依赖的独立子任务，实现高效并行化并在单次处理中充分恢复边

Result: 平均加速3.9-8.8倍，稀疏化质量提升（PCG迭代次数1.2倍高到1.8倍低），最坏情况加速1000倍以上

Conclusion: pdGRASS在可扩展性和性能方面显著改进，为图谱稀疏化问题提供了高效的并行解决方案

Abstract: Graph Spectral Sparsification (GSS) identifies an ultra-sparse subgraph, or
sparsifier, whose Laplacian matrix closely approximates the spectral properties
of the original graph, enabling substantial reductions in computational
complexity for computationally intensive problems in scientific computing. The
state-of-the-art method for efficient GSS is feGRASS, consisting of two steps:
1) spanning tree generation and 2) off-tree edge recovery. However, feGRASS
suffers from two main issues: 1) difficulties in parallelizing the recovery
step for strict data dependencies, and 2) performance degradation on skewed
inputs, often requiring multiple passes to recover sufficient edges. To address
these challenges, we propose parallel density-aware Graph Spectral
Sparsification (pdGRASS), a parallel algorithm that organizes edges into
disjoint subtasks without data dependencies between them, enabling efficient
parallelization and sufficient edge recovery in a single pass. We empirically
evaluate feGRASS and pdGRASS based on 1) off-tree edge-recovery runtime and 2)
sparsifier quality, measured by the iteration count required for convergence in
a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) application. The evaluation
demonstrates that, depending on the number of edges recovered, pdGRASS achieves
average speedups ranging from 3.9x to 8.8x. The resulting sparsifiers also show
between 1.2x higher and 1.8x lower PCG iteration counts, with further
improvements as more edges are recovered. Additionally, pdGRASS mitigates the
worst-case runtimes of feGRASS with over 1000x speedup. These results highlight
pdGRASS's significant improvements in scalability and performance for the graph
spectral sparsification problem.

Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent service optimization method based on a
multi-agent collaborative evolution mechanism to address governance challenges
in large-scale microservice architectures. These challenges include complex
service dependencies, dynamic topology structures, and fluctuating workloads.
The method models each service as an agent and introduces graph representation
learning to construct a service dependency graph. This enables agents to
perceive and embed structural changes within the system. Each agent learns its
policy based on a Markov Decision Process. A centralized training and
decentralized execution framework is used to integrate local autonomy with
global coordination. To enhance overall system performance and adaptability, a
game-driven policy optimization mechanism is designed. Through a
selection-mutation process, agent strategy distributions are dynamically
adjusted. This supports adaptive collaboration and behavioral evolution among
services. Under this mechanism, the system can quickly respond and achieve
stable policy convergence when facing scenarios such as sudden workload spikes,
topology reconfigurations, or resource conflicts. To evaluate the effectiveness
of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a representative
microservice simulation platform. Comparative analyses are performed against
several advanced approaches, focusing on coordination efficiency, adaptability,
and policy convergence performance. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms others in several key metrics. It significantly improves
governance efficiency and operational stability in large-scale microservice
systems. The method demonstrates strong practical value and engineering
feasibility.

Abstract: As the wireless communication paradigm is being transformed from human
centered communication services towards machine centered communication
services, the requirements of rate, latency and reliability for these services
have also been transformed drastically. Thus the concept of Ultra Reliable and
Low Latency Communication (URLLC) has emerged as a dominant theme for 5G and 6G
systems. Though the latency and reliability requirement varies from one use
case to another, URLLC services generally aim to achieve very high reliability
in the range of 99.999\% while ensuring the latency of up to 1 ms. These two
targets are however inherently opposed to one another. Significant amounts of
work have been carried out to meet these ambitious but conflicting targets. In
this article a comprehensive survey of the URLLC approaches in 5G systems are
analysed in detail. Effort has been made to trace the history and evolution of
latency and reliability issues in wireless communication. A layered approach is
taken where physical layer, Medium Access Control (MAC) layer as well as cross
layer techniques are discussed in detail. It also covers the design
consideration for various 5G and beyond verticals. Finally the article
concludes by providing a detailed discussion on challenges and future outlook
with particular focus on the emerging 6G paradigm.

Method: 将MDPF模型与DRR算法结合，使路由器能够基于带宽、延迟和未满足兴趣数等指标智能预测最优转发决策，同时确保数据流间的公平带宽分配。

Result: 仿真结果显示DRR-MDPF在吞吐量、兴趣满足率、丢包率、内容检索时间和负载均衡等多个指标上显著优于现有先进策略，在有限缓存和重流量下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DRR-MDPF为NDN提供了智能、自适应和可扩展的队列管理解决方案，有效解决了动态网络环境中的资源分配、拥塞控制和路由优化等核心挑战。

Abstract: Named Data Networking (NDN) represents a transformative shift in network
architecture, prioritizing content names over host addresses to enhance data
dissemination. Efficient queue and resource management are critical to NDN
performance, especially under dynamic and high-traffic conditions. This paper
introduces DRR-MDPF, a novel hybrid strategy that integrates the Markov
Decision Process Forwarding (MDPF) model with the Deficit Round Robin (DRR)
algorithm. MDPF enables routers to intelligently predict optimal forwarding
decisions based on key metrics such as bandwidth, delay, and the number of
unsatisfied Interests, while DRR ensures fair and adaptive bandwidth allocation
among competing data flows. The proposed method models each router as a
learning agent capable of adjusting its strategies through continuous feedback
and probabilistic updates. Simulation results using ndnSIM demonstrate that
DRR-MDPF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art strategies including SAF,
RFA, SMDPF, and LA-MDPF across various metrics such as throughput, Interest
Satisfaction Rate (ISR), packet drop rate, content retrieval time, and load
balancing. Notably, DRR-MDPF maintains robustness under limited cache sizes and
heavy traffic, offering enhanced adaptability and lower computational
complexity due to its single-path routing design. Furthermore, its multi-metric
decision-making capability enables more accurate interface selection, leading
to optimized network performance. Overall, DRR-MDPF serves as an intelligent,
adaptive, and scalable queue management solution for NDN, effectively
addressing core challenges such as resource allocation, congestion control, and
route optimization in dynamic networking environments.

Abstract: We consider a wireless network in which a source node needs to transmit a
large file to a destination node. The direct wireless link between the source
and the destination is assumed to be blocked. Multiple candidate relays are
available to forward packets from the source to the destination. A holding cost
is incurred for each packet stored at every relay in each time slot. The
objective is to design a policy for selecting a relay in each time slot to
which the source attempts to send a packet, so as to minimize the expected
long-run time-averaged total packet holding cost at the relays. This problem is
an instance of the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem, which is
provably hard to solve. We prove that this relay selection problem is
Whittle-indexable, and propose a method to compute the Whittle index of each
relay in every time slot. In each time slot, our relay selection policy
transmits a packet to the relay with the smallest Whittle index. Using
simulations, we show that the proposed policy outperforms the relay selection
policies proposed in prior work in terms of average cost, delay, as well as
throughput.

Conclusion: 数字双生加强的深度强化学习框架能够有效解决VNF迁移问题，实现低延迟和能消优化的双重目标

Abstract: The growing demand for services and the rapid deployment of virtualized
network functions (VNFs) pose significant challenges for achieving low-latency
and energy-efficient orchestration in modern edge-core network infrastructures.
To address these challenges, this study proposes a Digital Twin (DT)-empowered
Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for intelligent VNF migration that
jointly minimizes average end-to-end (E2E) delay and energy consumption. By
formulating the VNF migration problem as a Markov Decision Process and
utilizing the Advantage Actor-Critic model, the proposed framework enables
adaptive and real-time migration decisions. A key innovation of the proposed
framework is the integration of a DT module composed of a multi-task
Variational Autoencoder and a multi-task Long Short-Term Memory network. This
combination collectively simulates environment dynamics and generates
high-quality synthetic experiences, significantly enhancing training efficiency
and accelerating policy convergence. Simulation results demonstrate substantial
performance gains, such as significant reductions in both average E2E delay and
energy consumption, thereby establishing new benchmarks for intelligent VNF
migration in edge-core networks.

Conclusion: RANGAN框架有效解决了RAN系统异常检测的挑战，证明了GAN与Transformer结合在时序数据异常检测中的有效性。

Abstract: Radio Access Network (RAN) systems are inherently complex, requiring
continuous monitoring to prevent performance degradation and ensure optimal
user experience. The RAN leverages numerous key performance indicators (KPIs)
to evaluate system performance, generating vast amounts of data each second.
This immense data volume can make troubleshooting and accurate diagnosis of
performance anomalies more difficult. Furthermore, the highly dynamic nature of
RAN performance demands adaptive methodologies capable of capturing temporal
dependencies to detect anomalies reliably. In response to these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{RANGAN}, an anomaly detection framework that integrates a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a transformer architecture. To
enhance the capability of capturing temporal dependencies within the data,
RANGAN employs a sliding window approach during data preprocessing. We
rigorously evaluated RANGAN using the publicly available RAN performance
dataset from the Spotlight project \cite{sun-2024}. Experimental results
demonstrate that RANGAN achieves promising detection accuracy, notably
attaining an F1-score of up to $83\%$ in identifying network contention issues.

Result: 在Starlink星座测试中，DSROQ算法在用户体验和公平性方面均优于基准方案，性能主导因素随流量敏感性变化而转移

Conclusion: 联合路由带宽决策具有优势，当流量从时延敏感转向带宽敏感时，性能主导因素从调度转向路由带宽分配

Abstract: The modern Internet supports diverse applications with heterogeneous quality
of service (QoS) requirements. Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations
offer a promising solution to meet these needs, enhancing coverage in rural
areas and complementing terrestrial networks in urban regions. Ensuring QoS in
such networks requires joint optimization of routing, bandwidth allocation, and
dynamic queue scheduling, as traffic handling is critical for maintaining
service performance. This paper formulates a joint routing and bandwidth
allocation problem where QoS requirements are treated as soft constraints,
aiming to maximize user experience. An adaptive scheduling approach is
introduced to prioritize flow-specific QoS needs. We propose a Monte Carlo tree
search (MCTS)-inspired method to solve the NP-hard route and bandwidth
allocation problem, with Lyapunov optimization-based scheduling applied during
reward evaluation. Using the Starlink Phase 1 Version 2 constellation, we
compare end-user experience and fairness between our proposed DSROQ algorithm
and a benchmark scheme. Results show that DSROQ improves both performance
metrics and demonstrates the advantage of joint routing and bandwidth
decisions. Furthermore, we observe that the dominant performance factor shifts
from scheduling to routing and bandwidth allocation as traffic sensitivity
changes from latency-driven to bandwidth-driven.

Result: 集成STP推断的CHC求解器在CHC-COMP 2025的ADT-LIN类别中以显著优势获胜

Conclusion: STPs为递归数据结构程序验证提供了一种高效的不变量推断方法，仅需正样本即可实现自动化验证

Abstract: Despite the recent progress of automated program verification techniques,
fully automated verification of programs manipulating recursive data structures
remains a challenge. We introduce the notion of solvable tuple patterns (STPs)
to express invariants between list-like recursive data structures. A
distinguishing feature of STPs is that they can be efficiently inferred from
only a small number of positive samples; no negative samples are required. An
SMT solver that supports the sequence theory can be used to check that an
inferred STP is indeed an inductive invariant. After presenting basic
properties of STPs and an STP inference algorithm, we show how to incorporate
the STP inference into a CHC (Constrained Horn Clauses) solver supporting
list-like data structures, which serves as a uniform backend for automated
program verification tools. A CHC solver incorporating the STP inference has
won the ADT-LIN category of CHC-COMP 2025 by a big margin.

Abstract: It is commonly known that any Bayesian network can be implemented as a
probabilistic program, but the reverse direction is not so clear. In this work,
we address the open question to what extent a probabilistic program with
user-labelled sample statements and while loops - features found in languages
like Gen, Turing, and Pyro - can be represented graphically. To this end, we
extend existing operational semantics to support these language features. By
translating a program to its control-flow graph, we define a sound static
analysis that approximates the dependency structure of the random variables in
the program. As a result, we obtain a static factorisation of the implicitly
defined program density, which is equivalent to the known Bayesian network
factorisation for programs without loops and constant labels, but constitutes a
novel graphical representation for programs that define an unbounded number of
random variables via loops or dynamic labels. We further develop a sound
program slicing technique to leverage this structure to statically enable three
well-known optimisations for the considered program class: we reduce the
variance of gradient estimates in variational inference and we speed up both
single-site Metropolis Hastings and sequential Monte Carlo. These optimisations
are proven correct and empirically shown to match or outperform existing
techniques.

Motivation: 评估LLM在生成实际微服务应用代码方面的进展，微服务是一种广泛使用的架构模式，需要了解LLM在这一领域的实际能力。

Method: 定义了微服务应用的标准规范模板，提出了规范难度级别评估指标，开发了自动化测试LLM生成代码的框架，使用单元测试验证代码正确性。

Result: 实验结果显示，强大的LLM（如GPT-3o-mini）在中等难度规范上表现较好，但在高难度规范上表现很差，主要因难点在于复杂业务逻辑、外部服务集成、数据库集成咏非功能性要求。

Conclusion: LLM在生成实际微服务应用代码方面仍面临重大挑战，需要进一步研究来提高代码生成能力，特别是在复杂业务逻辑咏系统集成方面。

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate how far LLMs have advanced in generating code for
real-world problems. Specifically, we explore code synthesis for
microservice-based applications, a widely used architecture pattern. We define
a standard template for specifying these applications, and we propose a metric
for judging the difficulty level of a specification. The higher the score, the
more difficult it is to generate code for the specification. We develop a
framework to automate the process of testing LLM-synthesized code for a
microservice using unit tests. Our experimental results show that strong LLMs
(like GPT-3o-mini) do fairly well on medium difficulty specifications but do
very poorly on those of higher difficulty levels. This is due to more intricate
business logic, a greater use of external services, database integration and
inclusion of non-functional capabilities such as authentication. We analyzed
the errors in LLM-synthesized code and report on the key challenges LLMs face
in generating code for these specifications thereby suggesting future research
directions to improve code synthesis for real-world problems.

code generation, the generated code often exhibits poor runtime efficiency,
limiting its practical application in performance-sensitive scenarios. To
address this limitation, we propose an efficiency-oriented reinforcement
learning framework guided by a novel performance reward. Based on this
framework, we take a deeper dive into the code efficiency problem, identifying
then proposing methods to overcome key bottlenecks: (1) Dynamic exploration
overcomes the static data constraints of offline fine-tuning, enabling the
discovery of more efficient code implementations. (2) The error-insensitive
reinforcement learning method and high-contrast efficiency signals are crucial
for mitigating systematic errors and achieving effective optimization. (3)
Online exploration is most effective when starting from a high-correctness
baseline, as this allows for efficiency improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. With these discoveries, we finally propose a two-stage tuning method,
which achieves high and balanced performance across correctness and efficiency.
The results of experiments show the effectiveness of the method, which improves
code correctness by 10.18\% and runtime efficiency by 7.75\% on a 7B model,
achieving performance comparable to much larger model.

TL;DR: Chimera是一个基于LLM的SMT求解器模糊测试框架，通过生成可重用的术语生成器而非直接生成公式，解决了现有方法中语法无效和计算开销大的问题，在Z3和cvc5上发现了43个已确认的bug。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMT求解器在现代系统和编程语言研究中至关重要，但其正确性测试面临挑战：传统测试方法难以跟上求解器的快速演进，而基于LLM的方法存在语法无效率高和计算开销大的问题。

Method: Chimera框架使用LLM（1）从文档中自动提取SMT理论的上下文无关文法（包括求解器特定扩展）；（2）合成符合这些文法的可组合布尔术语生成器。在模糊测试时，用LLM合成的生成器产生的术语填充现有公式的结构骨架。

Result: 在Z3和cvc5两个主流SMT求解器上的实验表明，Chimera发现了43个已确认的bug，其中40个已被开发者修复。

Conclusion: Chimera通过转向术语生成器合成而非直接公式生成，有效确保了语法有效性并促进了语义多样性，同时只需一次性LLM交互投入，显著降低了运行时成本。

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems
and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like
symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the
critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas
are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed
well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly
evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show
promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain:
nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative
interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In
this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that
addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the
synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly,
Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for
SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2)
synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.
During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing
formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.
This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.
Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment,
dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT
solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43
confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.

TL;DR: RCLAgent是一个基于多智能体递归思维框架的自适应根因定位方法，通过模拟SRE的递归性、多维度扩展和跨模态推理特征，在单次请求中实现优于现有方法的根因定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代微服务系统日益复杂，面临频繁故障，现有根因定位方法要么依赖预定义模式难以适应变化环境，要么缺乏可解释性让SRE困惑。通过研究SRE的根因分析过程，发现其具有递归性、多维度扩展和跨模态推理三个关键特征。

Method: 提出RCLAgent方法，采用多智能体递归思维框架，使用新颖的递归思维策略指导LLM推理过程，整合多智能体数据和工具辅助分析来精确定位根因。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验评估表明，RCLAgent仅使用单次请求就能实现根因定位，性能优于依赖聚合多个请求的最先进方法。

Conclusion: RCLAgent有效提升了复杂微服务环境中根因定位的效率和精度，证明了该方法在增强系统可靠性方面的有效性。

Abstract: As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and
complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained,
interdependent subsystems-they are facing more frequent failures. Ensuring
system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces
and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing
methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to
evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning
process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this
paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of
failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different
organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis
exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion,
and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent,
an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that
leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a
novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process,
effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to
accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public
datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing
the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art
methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore
the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root
cause localization in complex microservice environments.

Conclusion: 需要新的测试范式来应对LLM应用的独特挑战，提出的协作策略和AICL协议为LLM应用测试的标准化和工具化提供了实践指导

Abstract: Applications of Large Language Models~(LLMs) have evolved from simple text
generators into complex software systems that integrate retrieval augmentation,
tool invocation, and multi-turn interactions. Their inherent non-determinism,
dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality
assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer
architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt
Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess
the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer:
directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at
the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference
core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software
engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community
reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics,
and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that
underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of
collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate},
and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance
framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring.
Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal
to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We
propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}}
(AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the
test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.

TL;DR: LLMs能够从法律文本生成高质量的Gherkin行为规范，显著减少人工工作量，为合规软件开发提供结构化工件


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律文本采用技术中性语言编写，工程师手动创建合规需求文档劳动密集且易出错，需要利用GenAI自动化这一过程

Method: 采用准实验设计，10名参与者评估Claude和Llama从食品安全法规生成的60个Gherkin规范，每个规范由2人评估，共120次评估，从相关性、清晰度、完整性、单一性和时间节省五个标准进行评分

Result: 相关性75%最高评分，20%次高；清晰度90%最高；完整性75%最高，19%次高；单一性82%最高，12%次高；时间节省68%最高，24%次高。Llama在清晰度、完整性和时间节省方面略优，Claude在单一性方面更强

Conclusion: LLM能够从法律文本生成高质量的Gherkin规范，减少人工工作量，为实施、保证和测试生成提供有用的结构化工件

Abstract: Context: Laws and regulations increasingly affect software design and quality
assurance, but legal texts are written in technology-neutral language. This
creates challenges for engineers who must develop compliance artifacts such as
requirements and acceptance criteria. Manual creation is labor-intensive,
error-prone, and requires domain expertise. Advances in Generative AI (GenAI),
especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a way to automate deriving such
artifacts.
  Objective: We present the first systematic human-subject study of LLMs'
ability to derive behavioral specifications from legal texts using a
quasi-experimental design. These specifications translate legal requirements
into a developer-friendly form.
  Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety
regulations by Claude and Llama. Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60
specifications were produced. Each participant assessed 12 across five
criteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings. Each
specification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments.
  Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest.
Clarity reached 90% highest. Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second.
Singularity: 82% highest, 12% second. Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second. No
lowest ratings occurred. Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences
across participants or models. Llama slightly outperformed Claude in Clarity,
Completeness, and Time Savings, while Claude was stronger in Singularity.
Feedback noted hallucinations and omissions but confirmed the utility of the
specifications.
  Conclusion: LLMs can generate high-quality Gherkin specifications from legal
texts, reducing manual effort and providing structured artifacts useful for
implementation, assurance, and test generation.

Conclusion: 可持续性视角为架构师提供了独立于架构框架和行业背景的结构化指导，能够有效应对可持续性质量属性挑战。

Abstract: Sustainability is increasingly recognized as an emerging quality property in
software-intensive systems, yet architects lack structured guidance to address
it effectively throughout the software design phase. Architectural
perspectives-an architectural knowledge artifact composed of concerns,
activities, tactics, pitfalls, and checklists-offer a promising approach to
tackle such emerging quality properties across architectural views and are also
independent of architecture frameworks and industry contexts. In this paper, we
present a sustainability perspective vision, i.e., a revised notion of
architectural perspective meant to be filled with its own elements to target
sustainability concerns. We formulate our sustainability perspective vision
through evidence from applying snowballing to seminal literature and from
conducting a focus group with experts in the field. Our findings confirm the
relevance of the different perspective elements in practice and highlight
implications for shaping a sustainability perspective that meets industrial
needs.

TL;DR: 提出基于断言的测试预言方法，使用遗传编程和决策树技术生成逻辑和算术谓词，在不执行测试的情况下预测测试结果，有效应对CPS模拟器的不可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPS模拟测试成本高且结果不可靠，需要无需系统执行的自动化测试预言来降低测试成本，同时要求预言具有可解释性并能应对模拟器的波动性。

Method: 使用遗传编程（GP）和决策树（DT）/决策规则（DR）两种方法生成基于断言的测试预言。GP方法采用Ochiai、Tarantula和Naish等谱基故障定位公式作为适应度函数。

Result: 基于GP和Ochiai方法生成的测试预言准确率显著高于其他方法，即使在系统存在波动性的情况下仍保持优势，平均准确率变化仅为4%。

Conclusion: 基于GP和Ochiai的断言测试预言方法在航空航天、网络和自动驾驶等领域表现出高准确性和鲁棒性，是解决CPS测试成本高和结果不可靠问题的有效方案。

Abstract: Simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is costly due to the
time-consuming execution of CPS simulators. In addition, CPS simulators may be
flaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test
re-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not
require system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs.
Ideally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human
understanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential
flakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test
oracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the
inputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test
oracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes,
fails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe
two methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic
programming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization
(SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness
functions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We
evaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains
of aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles
generated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those
obtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this
accuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system
under test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by
GP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in
their accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving
systems with flaky behaviours.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在并发bug检测方面存在三个主要限制：缺乏大规模专用数据集、并发语义表示不足、二元分类无法提供细粒度调试信息。

Method: 构建专用并发bug数据集，集成预训练模型与异构图神经网络，采用新的并发感知代码属性图(CCPG)来表征并发语义，并使用SubgraphX进行精确定位。

Conclusion: 该方法通过专用数据集和并发语义的有效表征，显著提升了并发bug的检测和定位能力，为软件可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in
multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus
compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning
methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and
dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack
sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary
classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as
precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for
effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a
dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation.
We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network
(GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that
concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further
facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method,
which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them
to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an
improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to
state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代可配置系统虽然提供了灵活性，但也带来了配置相关的问题。现有诊断方法主要关注故障后分析，但缺乏对软件是否提供足够故障信息的研究

Method: 1) 通过静态污点分析追踪配置相关数据流，识别配置敏感代码段；2) 基于LLM分析配置代码上下文生成诊断日志语句

Result: 在8个流行软件系统上评估显示：错误定位准确率达100%，配置信息暴露率80%；日志点覆盖率74%，优于基线方法；诊断时间加快1.25倍，故障排除准确率提升251.4%

Conclusion: ConfLogger有效增强了软件配置可诊断性，为配置相关问题的诊断提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Modern configurable systems offer customization via intricate configuration
spaces, yet such flexibility introduces pervasive configuration-related issues
such as misconfigurations and latent softwarebugs. Existing diagnosability
supports focus on post-failure analysis of software behavior to identify
configuration issues, but none of these approaches look into whether the
software clue sufficient failure information for diagnosis. To fill in the
blank, we propose the idea of configuration logging to enhance existing logging
practices at the source code level. We develop ConfLogger, the first tool that
unifies configuration-aware static taint analysis with LLM-based log generation
to enhance software configuration diagnosability. Specifically, our method 1)
identifies configuration-sensitive code segments by tracing
configuration-related data flow in the whole project, and 2) generates
diagnostic log statements by analyzing configuration code contexts. Evaluation
results on eight popular software systems demonstrate the effectiveness of
ConfLogger to enhance configuration diagnosability. Specifically,
ConfLogger-enhanced logs successfully aid a log-based misconfiguration
diagnosis tool to achieve 100% accuracy on error localization in 30 silent
misconfiguration scenarios, with 80% directly resolvable through explicit
configuration information exposed. In addition, ConfLogger achieves 74%
coverage of existing logging points, outperforming baseline LLM-based loggers
by 12% and 30%. It also gains 8.6% higher in precision, 79.3% higher in recall,
and 26.2% higher in F1 compared to the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of
variable logging while also augmenting diagnostic value. A controlled user
study on 22 cases further validated its utility, speeding up diagnostic time by
1.25x and improving troubleshooting accuracy by 251.4%.

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了面板AR(1)模型在单位根情况下的估计和推断问题，蒙特卡洛研究验证了有限样本性质的良好表现。

Abstract: In this paper we consider two kinds of generalizations of Lancaster's (Review
of Economic Studies, 2002) Modified ML estimator (MMLE) for the panel AR(1)
model with fixed effects and arbitrary initial conditions and possibly
covariates when the time dimension, T, is fixed. When the autoregressive
parameter rho=1, the limiting modified profile log-likelihood function for this
model has a stationary point of inflection, and rho is first-order
underidentified but second-order identified. We show that the generalized MMLEs
exist w.p.a.1. and are uniquely defined w.p.1. and consistent for any value of
|rho| =< 1. When rho=1, the rate of convergence of the MMLEs is N^{1/4}, where
N is the cross-sectional dimension of the panel. We then develop an asymptotic
theory for GMM estimators when one of the parameters is only second-order
identified and use this to derive the limiting distributions of the MMLEs. They
are generally asymmetric when rho=1. We also show that Quasi LM tests that are
based on the modified profile log-likelihood and use its expected rather than
observed Hessian, with an additional modification for rho=1, and confidence
regions based on inverting these tests have correct asymptotic size in a
uniform sense when |rho| =< 1. Finally, we investigate the finite sample
properties of the MMLEs and the QLM test in a Monte Carlo study.

Conclusion: 所提出的(准)LM检验方法在面板AR模型推断中具有理论上的最优性和实际应用的稳健性，特别是在处理弱识别和异方差性方面表现优异。

Abstract: This paper proposes new inference methods for panel AR models with arbitrary
initial conditions and heteroskedasticity and possibly additional regressors
that are robust to the strength of identification. Specifically, we consider
several Maximum Likelihood based methods of constructing tests and confidence
sets (CSs) and show that (Quasi) LM tests and CSs that use the expected Hessian
rather than the observed Hessian of the log-likelihood have correct asymptotic
size (in a uniform sense). We derive the power envelope of a Fixed Effects
version of such a LM test for hypotheses involving the autoregressive parameter
when the average information matrix is estimated by a centered OPG estimator
and the model is only second-order identified, and show that it coincides with
the maximal attainable power curve in the worst case setting. We also study the
empirical size and power properties of these (Quasi) LM tests and CSs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了印尼东部地区公务员的创新工作行为，发现变革型领导和工作投入直接影响创新行为，但组织公正既无直接作用也不具调节作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印尼东部地区公务员需要展现创新工作行为，但变革型领导、工作投入和组织公正对创新行为的影响以及组织公正的调节作用仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 研究在印尼东部北马鲁古省进行，采用随机抽样获得500名公务员数据，使用结构方程模型-偏最小二乘法（SEM-PLS）进行因果关系和调节效应分析。

Result: 变革型领导和工作投入直接影响创新工作行为，但组织公正既没有直接影响，也不具有调节变革型领导和工作投入与创新行为关系的作用。

Conclusion: 研究强调了领导力和工作投入在提升公务员创新行为中的重要性，扩展了社会交换理论，并为印尼当地政府组织提供了理论和实践参考。

Abstract: Regional civil servants in Indonesia, especially in the eastern regions, are
now required to exhibit innovative work behavior (IWB) as mandated by national
regulations. While transformational leadership (TFL) and work engagement (WE)
are believed to foster such behavior, the impact and the moderating role of
organizational justice (OJ) remain underexplored. This study addresses that gap
by examining how TFL and WE contribute to IWB development within the context of
public sector work, with OJ potentially moderating these relationships. This
study aimed to determine the direct influence of TFL, WE, and OJ on IWB and to
analyze the role of OJ as a moderating variable. This research was conducted in
the eastern region of Indonesia, especially North Maluku Province, in various
regional apparatus organizations. and a random sample of 500 people was taken.
This study used Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS)
regression analysis as a data analysis method to test the causal relationship
and moderation effects of each hypothesis. The study findings reveal that while
TFL and WE directly influence IWB, OJ neither has a direct effect nor serves as
a moderating variable. These findings offer theoretical and practical
contributions to local government organizations in Indonesia, emphasizing the
importance of leadership and engagement in enhancing innovative behavior at
work. This study extends and enhances the development of social exchange theory
based on civil servants' IWB. Furthermore, this study expands the theoretical
perspective by examining how TFL, WE, and OJ influence innovative work behavior
practices to improve employee innovative behaviour. Finally, this study
empirically examines the moderating impact of organizational justice on the
relationship between TFL and WE on IWB.

### [203] [How Big Data Dilutes Cognitive Resources, Interferes with Rational Decision-making and Affects Wealth Distribution ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20435)
*Yongheng Hu*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大数据环境下消费效用测量的局限性，提出了消费调整权重函数(CAWF)来分析大数据对认知资源的影响，发现金融摩擦降低会增加企业平均财富但加剧不平等，有效消费权重为0.5时财富不平等最低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大数据环境下传统消费效用测量方法的不足，特别是非理性消费无法转化为效用的问题，需要新的理论框架来分析大数据对经济主体认知和决策的影响。

Method: 构建消费调整权重函数(CAWF)，基于均值场博弈(MFG)理论建立包含金融摩擦的企业财富分配模型，进行理论和实证分析。

Result: 金融摩擦降低会增加企业平均财富但加剧财富不平等；有效消费权重增加会提高企业平均财富，财富不平等呈U型变化，权重为0.5时不平等程度最低。

Conclusion: 提出了基于认知资源禀赋的新补充假说来完善'卢卡斯批判'，强调大数据通过稀释机制影响经济主体的认知资源和决策过程。

Abstract: Big data has exponentially dilated consumption demand and speed, but can they
all convert to utility? We argue about the measures of consumption and utility
acquisition in CARR utility function under the condition of big data
interaction, we indicate its weakness, i.e., irrational consumption does not
lead to the acquisition of utility. We consider that big data, which is
different from macro and micro economic signals, formed by general information
entropy, affects agents' rational cognition, which makes a part of their
consumption ineffective. We preliminarily propose the theory that how dilution
mechanism driven by big data will affect agents' cognitive resources. Based on
theoretical and empirical analysis, we construct the Consumption Adjustment
Weight Function (CAWF) of agents interacting with big data and further apply it
to a model of firm wealth distribution with financial frictions, we get
analytical solutions according to the Mean Field Game (MFG) and find: Lower
financial friction increases the average wealth of firms but also leads to
greater wealth inequality. When agents convert effective consumption into
utility, which is a weight of total consumption, the average wealth of firms
increases with the weight increasing. Meanwhile, wealth inequality follows a
U-shaped trend, and it will be the lowest level when the weight approaches to
0.5. In conclusion, we try to provide a new complementary hypothesis to refine
the 'Lucas Critique' according to the cognitive resources as endowments
involved in the decision-making of agents.

Motivation: 评估专利引用作为发明重要性代理指标的可靠性，区分技术价值、私人经济价值和社会价值的不同维度

Method: 系统回顾验证研究，包括专家评级、市场数据、续展记录和补偿报告等多种验证方法

Result: 引用数量与各种价值维度呈正相关，但作为指标噪声较大，相关性存在但远非确定性指标

Conclusion: 专利引用是有用的重要性代理指标，但需要谨慎使用，因其噪声较大且不能完全代表发明的真实价值

Abstract: This article reviews the empirical evidence on the use of patent citations as
a proxy for invention importance. It distinguishes between technical merit,
private economic value, and social value, and surveys validation studies using
expert ratings, market data, renewal records, and compensation reports. The
findings confirm that while the count of citations is positively associated
with various dimensions of value, it remains a noisy indicator -- correlated
but far from definitive.

*Benjamin Moll*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 该论文认为异质主体宏观经济学中的理性预期假设不现实，应被替代，因为其导致维度诅咒和计算困难，限制了模型在金融危机等重大问题中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理性预期假设要求决策者预测横截面分布来预测均衡价格，这导致了无限维度的动态规划问题（"怪物方程"），计算困难且不符合现实世界中主体的决策能力。

Method: 提出三个替代标准：(1)计算可处理性，(2)与经验证据一致性，(3)对卢卡斯批判的免疫性。讨论了临时均衡方法、调查预期、最小二乘学习和强化学习等替代方向。

Result: 理性预期假设在异质主体模型中导致严重的计算困难，限制了模型在分析总风险和金融危机等非线性问题中的应用价值。

Conclusion: 需要寻找理性预期的现实替代方案，这些方案应该满足计算可行性、经验一致性和理论稳健性的要求，文中提出的几个方向为此提供了有希望的路径。

Abstract: The thesis of this essay is that, in heterogeneous agent macroeconomics, the
assumption of rational expectations about equilibrium prices is unrealistic and
should be replaced. Rational expectations imply that decision makers forecast
equilibrium prices like interest rates by forecasting cross-sectional
distributions. This leads to an extreme version of the curse of dimensionality:
dynamic programming problems in which the entire distribution is a state
variable ("Master equation" a.k.a. "Monster equation"). Frontier computational
methods struggle with these infinite-dimensional Bellman equations, making it
implausible that real-world agents solve the associated decision problems.
These difficulties also limit the applicability of the heterogeneous-agent
approach to central questions in macroeconomics -- those involving aggregate
risk and non-linearities such as financial crises. This troublesome feature of
the rational expectations assumption poses a challenge: what should replace it?
I outline three criteria for alternative approaches: (1) computational
tractability, (2) consistency with empirical evidence, and (3) (some) immunity
to the Lucas critique. I then discuss several promising directions, including
temporary equilibrium approaches, incorporating survey expectations,
least-squares learning, and reinforcement learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哥伦比亚长期冲突导致的强迫性内部流离失所问题，评估FARC停火协议对流离失所的影响

Method: 采用双重差分法，利用停火时间点和冲突前FARC在各城市分布差异进行分析

Result: 受影响地区严重流离失所事件大幅减少，效果逐步显现且持久

Conclusion: 稳定性和和平协议的有效实施对减轻强迫性内部流离失所及其深远后果至关重要

Abstract: Colombia's prolonged conflict has made the country one of the most affected
by forced internal displacement (FID) in the world. This study examines the
impact of the FARC's 2014 unilateral and permanent ceasefire on FID. We use a
difference-in-differences strategy that exploits the timing of the ceasefire
and the pre-conflict distribution of FARC presence across municipalities.
Results show a substantial reduction in severe displacement episodes in
affected areas, with effects that emerged gradually and persisted over time.
These findings highlight the importance of stability and the effective
implementation of peace agreements in mitigating FID and its far-reaching
consequences.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的指数贴现模型表示方法，通过效率度量来评估偏离模型的程度，使用显示偏好方法且无需对效用函数做参数假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指数贴现模型在描述跨期选择时存在局限性，需要一种能够量化偏离程度且不依赖特定参数假设的方法。

Method: 采用显示偏好方法，不对效用函数做任何参数假设，允许无限制的异质性，使用结账扫描仪的纵向数据进行实证分析。

Result: 该方法能够有效识别和量化偏离指数贴现模型的程度，并为偏离来源提供深入见解。

Conclusion: 提出的新表示方法和效率度量为评估跨期选择行为提供了灵活且强大的分析工具，有助于理解偏离指数贴现的原因。

Abstract: This paper derives a novel representation of the exponential discounting
model that allows one to assess departures from the model via a measure of
efficiency. The approach uses a revealed preference methodology that does not
make any parametric assumption on the utility function and allows for
unrestricted heterogeneity. The method is illustrated using longitudinal data
from checkout scanners and gives insights into sources of departure from
exponential discounting.

*Sarang Shah*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信号的动态建模方法，将传统静态微观经济模型转换为动态模型，并以经典的鲁滨逊漂流岛消费模型为例进行演示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统经济学主要关注静态均衡，忽视了时间依赖性现象（如路径依赖），限制了模型与实证观察的对比能力。需要发展动态建模方法来更好地捕捉经济行为的时间维度。

Method: 使用基于信号的动态建模方法，从经典静态模型出发，将效用函数作为消费力的生成器，构建动态模型，并展示如何用拉格朗日和哈密顿力学形式表达。

Result: 成功将静态鲁滨逊漂流岛消费模型转换为动态模型，证明了动态建模方法的可行性，并提供了机械力学表述的替代形式。

Conclusion: 动态建模方法为经济学提供了新的科学迭代路径，相比静态方法能够提供更丰富的解释和更准确的实证对比能力。

Abstract: Economics has long been a science of static equilibria, in which time is a
second-order rather than first-order concern. Without time, economic modelers
may neglect or obscure the role of time-dependent phenomena, e.g.
path-dependency, and limit their ability to compare agnostically the model
results with empirical observations. In this article, I outline a dynamic,
signals-based recipe for building microeconomic models from traditional static
models. I demonstrate this recipe using a classic "desert island" Robinson
Crusoe (RC) model of consumption. Starting from a classic static derivation, I
then move to a dynamic view, using the utility function as a generator of force
on consumption. Finally, I show that the resulting dynamic model may be
expressed in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian terms. I conclude by suggesting a
recipe for scientific iteration using these alternate mechanical formulations,
and the alternative explanations these dynamic models may suggest compared to
employing a static approach to modeling.

TL;DR: 研究序列社会学习中的信息验证机制，分析代理人在可付费获取硬证据的情况下如何影响错误级联的持续与自我纠正


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在代理人可以付费验证信息并获得公开可核查证据的环境中，社会学习过程如何避免或纠正错误的信息级联，特别是在存在从众压力的情况下

Method: 建立序列社会学习模型，代理人观察公共历史、接收私人信号、可选择付费调查（仅在主张为真时成功）、可披露或隐藏证据，分析二元和连续行动设置下的均衡行为

Result: 在二元基准中推导出调查临界点，显示其相对于经典级联带的位置决定可打破性；连续行动中粗观察和从众性会重现级联，但偶尔的披露会使其崩溃；得到具有透明比较静态和政策杠杆的"韧性边界"

Conclusion: 付费验证机制为社会学习过程中的错误级联提供了自我纠正的可能，通过适当的调查成本和披露机制设计，可以显著提高社会共识的准确性和韧性

Abstract: We study sequential social learning when agents can sometimes pay to verify a
claim and obtain hard, publicly checkable evidence. Each agent observes the
public history, receives a private signal, may investigate at a cost
(succeeding only when the claim is true), and can disclose or conceal any
proof. Actions are binary or continuous, with a conformity pull toward the
prevailing consensus. We characterize when false cascades persist and when
societies self-correct. In the binary benchmark, we derive an investigation
cutoff and show how its location relative to classic cascade bands governs
breakability; a simple knife-edge condition guarantees that any wrong cascade
at the boundary is overturned with positive probability. With continuous
actions, coarse observation and conformity can recreate cascades, yet
occasional disclosures collapse them. These forces yield a tractable
"resilience frontier" with transparent comparative statics and policy levers.

Motivation: 探索固定价格环境下，卖家品质投资和买家信仰形成的动态互动机制，以及信息不完全如何影响市场效率。

Method: 建立马尔可夫动态声誉模型，卖家选择成本化品质，买家观察购买历史和私人信号。采用马尔可夫选择来分析信仰动态。

Result: 信仰分化为两种级聚状态（动作无效、投资为零）和内部投资区域。投资政策呈倒U型，出现早期解决和双峰投资两种模式。高信号精度可能减少投资。灵活定价和公开结果抓发能提高投资效率。

Conclusion: 固定价格下信息不完全导致信仰级聚和投资不足。灵活定价和信息公开是重要的设计杠杆，能够维持信息效率、消除级聚效应、提高投资水平，从而改善市场社会福利。

Abstract: We study a dynamic reputation model with a fixed posted price where only
purchases are public. A long-lived seller chooses costly quality; each buyer
observes the purchase history and a private signal. Under a Markov selection,
beliefs split into two cascades - where actions are unresponsive and investment
is zero - and an interior region where the seller invests. The policy is
inverse-U in reputation and produces two patterns: Early Resolution (rapid
absorption at the optimistic cascade) and Double Hump (two investment
episodes). Higher signal precision at fixed prices enlarges cascades and can
reduce investment. We compare welfare and analyze two design levers: flexible
pricing, which can keep actions informative and remove cascades for patient
sellers, and public outcome disclosure, which makes purchases more informative
and expands investment.

Motivation: 研究顾问在观察项目复杂度后设定阈值时，代理人如何解读这一阈值信息并选择努力水平，比较天真制度和精明制度下的不同均衡结果

Method: 建立理论模型分析两种信息制度：天真制度（阈值被视为非信息性）和精明制度（阈值作为信号，代理人更新信念）。通过均衡分析、参数化基准案例和标准精炼来研究分离、混同和半分离结果

Result: 最优阈值随复杂度增加而上升；给出了分离、混同和半分离结果的充分条件；在均匀能力、指数复杂度和幂成本基准下，提供了明确的参数区域划分；标准精炼消除了大部分混同结果

Conclusion: 研究提供了透明的比较静态分析和跨制度福利比较，揭示了阈值作为信号时对代理人努力激励的重要影响

Abstract: A benevolent advisor observes a project's complexity and posts a pass - fail
threshold before the agent chooses effort. The project succeeds only if ability
and effort together clear complexity. We compare two informational regimes. In
the naive regime, the threshold is treated as non-informative; in the
sophisticated regime, the threshold is a signal and the agent updates beliefs.
We characterize equilibrium threshold policies and show that the optimal
threshold rises with complexity under mild regularity. We then give
primitives-based sufficient conditions that guarantee separating, pooling, or
semi-separating outcomes. In a benchmark with uniform ability, exponential
complexity, and power costs, we provide explicit parameter regions that
partition the space by equilibrium type; a standard refinement eliminates most
pooling. The results yield transparent comparative statics and welfare
comparisons across regimes.

### [1] [AI-Powered Math Tutoring: Platform for Personalized and Adaptive Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12484)
*Jarosław A. Chudziak,Adam Kostka*

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅导系统在数学领域表现不足，缺乏深度反思和结构化教学工具，限制了学习效果。

Method: 开发了一个结合自适应反馈、结构化课程生成和教材知识检索的多代理AI辅导平台。

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large
language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain
knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI
positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement,
current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive
nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or
incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is
most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain
underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring
systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,
individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel
multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized
feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to
enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students
to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise
for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized
exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in
education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical
agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and
effective systems for teaching mathematics.

Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior,
i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

Result: 提供了XRL领域的现状综述，并指出了相关领域和未来需求。

Conclusion: XRL领域需要进一步关注相关领域的研究，并满足一些未解决的需求。

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been
accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use
of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and
explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed,
grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a
sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims
to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning.
We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The
first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second
relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide
a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of
domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.
Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

### [4] [Fly, Fail, Fix: Iterative Game Repair with Reinforcement Learning and Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12666)
*Alex Zook,Josef Spjut,Jonathan Tremblay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合强化学习（RL）代理和多模态模型（LMM）的自动化游戏设计框架，通过RL代理的测试和LMM的修改来优化游戏设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生成系统仅通过检查游戏代码或资源难以捕捉静态规则和内容如何转化为动态玩家行为，因此需要一种更有效的方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 框架通过RL代理进行游戏测试，生成数值指标或图像摘要，再由LMM分析这些数据并修改游戏配置以达成目标。

Result: 实验证明，LMM能够基于RL代理的行为轨迹迭代优化游戏机制。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助游戏设计提供了实用且可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer
receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play
traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.
We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by
RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,
scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

### [5] [Benchmarking Deception Probes via Black-to-White Performance Boosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12691)

Result: 现有欺骗探针在黑盒到白盒监控中表现出微弱但有潜力的性能提升。

Conclusion: 研究为AI欺骗检测提供了初步结果，表明现有探针仍需改进，但方向值得探索。

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries.
Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同伴学习虽有效但存在限制，需同水平同伴。

Method: 假设同水平同伴会犯相同错误，以英语写作为例验证。

Conclusion: 研究旨在验证AI同伴学习的可行性。

Abstract: In recent years, peer learning has gained attention as a method that promotes
spontaneous thinking among learners, and its effectiveness has been confirmed
by numerous studies. This study aims to develop an AI Agent as a learning
companion that enables peer learning anytime and anywhere. However, peer
learning between humans has various limitations, and it is not always
effective. Effective peer learning requires companions at the same proficiency
levels. In this study, we assume that a learner's peers with the same
proficiency level as the learner make the same mistakes as the learner does and
focus on English composition as a specific example to validate this approach.

Conclusion: 新框架有望推动AI世界模型的研究，实现类人的快速适应和泛化能力，是迈向通用人工智能的关键一步。

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

Result: 通过动态加权伦理属性，解决了在生成模拟中如何权衡伦理决策的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了人类判断与自动化模拟，提高了决策效率和可行性。

Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade,
deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

### [12] [VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885)
*Jian Yao,Ran Cheng,Kay Chen Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出VAR-MATH框架，通过符号化评估揭示RL训练的LLMs在数学推理中的局限性，发现现有方法依赖表面启发式而非真实推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法在数学推理上的改进可能仅是过拟合基准测试的假象，而非真实推理能力的提升。

Method: 引入VAR-MATH框架，将固定数值问题转化为符号模板，要求模型解决多个变体以评估一致性。

Result: 实验显示RL模型在符号化版本上性能显著下降（AMC23下降48.0%，AIME24下降58.3%），表明其依赖表面启发式。

Conclusion: VAR-MATH提供了一种抗污染、评估数学推理能力的稳健方法，揭示了现有RL方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

### [13] [A Translation of Probabilistic Event Calculus into Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12989)
*Lyris Xu,Fabio Aurelio D'Asaro,Luke Dickens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将概率事件演算（PEC）转化为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），以支持目标导向推理和规划，同时保持PEC的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEC在不确定环境中具有强大的叙事推理能力，但缺乏目标导向推理机制。

Method: 通过将PEC领域形式化转化为MDP，引入“行动情境”概念，保留PEC的灵活语义。

Result: PEC-MDP形式化支持时间推理和目标驱动规划，并能将学习策略映射回可读的PEC表示。

Conclusion: PEC-MDP扩展了PEC的能力，同时保持了其可解释性。

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

Result: 在知名优化问题实例上测试，验证了方法的可行性和计算解释的难度。

Conclusion: X-MILP为MILP提供了一种有效的对比解释方法，帮助用户理解解决方案背后的原因。

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing
interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation,
especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes
formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic
approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint
reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes
about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we
determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by
computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set
of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons"
constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among
the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of
well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of
computing explanations.

### [16] [From Roots to Rewards: Dynamic Tree Reasoning with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13142)
*Ahmed Bahloul,Simon Malberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态强化学习框架，改进静态树结构推理方法（如ProbTree），通过实时信心估计和策略学习提升推理质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ProbTree静态实现中的两大限制：无法动态适应中间结果和计算效率低下。

Method: 采用动态强化学习框架，逐步构建推理树，基于实时信心估计学习最优策略（分解、检索或聚合）。

Result: 在保持概率严谨性的同时，提高了解决方案质量和计算效率。

Conclusion: 为树结构推理建立了新范式，平衡了概率框架的可靠性和实际问答系统所需的灵活性。

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering

### [17] [Black Box Deployed -- Functional Criteria for Artificial Moral Agents in the LLM Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13175)
*Matthew E. Brophy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出传统伦理标准不适用于大型语言模型（LLMs），并修订了十项功能标准以评估LLM为基础的道德代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs的随机输出和不透明内部状态，传统伦理标准已不适用，需修订标准以指导道德代理的发展。

Method: 提出十项功能标准，并通过模拟道德代理（SMA-LLS）和自动驾驶公交车（APB）场景进行验证。

Result: 修订的标准（如道德一致性、上下文敏感性等）能更有效地评估LLM的道德代理。

Conclusion: 新标准有助于LLM道德代理与社会更好地融合，未来需进一步验证其适用性。

Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)
necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to
evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the
assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their
stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that
traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this
mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper
proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based
artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative
integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,
corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral
imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating
Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater
alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We
illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous
public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally
salient contexts.

*Besik Dundua,Temur Kutsia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合高阶模式和模糊等价关系的统一算法，用于决策任务中的推理，证明了其终止性、可靠性和完备性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涉及抽象函数和谓词推理的决策任务中，高阶理论与模糊逻辑的结合具有实用性，但开发高效的计算方法是一大挑战。

Method: 采用高阶模式和基于最小T-范数的模糊等价关系，提出统一算法并证明其性质。

Result: 算法能计算最一般的统一子，并在可统一时提供最高近似度。

Conclusion: 该算法为高阶模糊推理提供了有效的计算工具，适用于需要模糊匹配的场景。

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in
decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and
predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing
efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism
presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more
straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and
computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and
fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum
T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,
soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp
counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the
highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

### [19] [The Generative Energy Arena (GEA): Incorporating Energy Awareness in Large Language Model (LLM) Human Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13302)
*Carlos Arriaga,Gonzalo Martínez,Eneko Sendin,Javier Conde,Pedro Reviriego*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GEA（Generative Energy Arena）的新方法，通过公开竞技场评估大型语言模型（LLMs），并引入能耗信息，初步结果显示用户倾向于选择更节能的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估LLMs的方法（如自动化基准或人工评估）存在局限性，如与人类评价相关性低或可扩展性问题。同时，模型能耗问题日益重要，需研究能耗意识如何影响用户选择。

Method: 提出GEA，一个公开竞技场平台，允许用户评估模型并纳入能耗信息，通过用户选择行为生成模型排名。

Result: 初步结果表明，在了解能耗信息后，用户更倾向于选择较小且更节能的模型，而非高性能但高能耗的模型。

Conclusion: GEA提供了一种结合能耗意识的评估方法，显示用户对节能模型的偏好，为未来模型设计和选择提供了新视角。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨前沿AI模型是否接近或超越人类专家水平，尤其是在解决实际研究问题上的能力。

Method: 构建FormulaOne基准测试，结合图论、逻辑和算法，生成高难度问题，并评估模型表现。

Result: 前沿模型如OpenAI的o3在FormulaOne上表现极差，解决率低于1%。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型在复杂领域仍远未达到专家水平，FormulaOne为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close
are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can
tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific
understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn
away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on
real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph
theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of
frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of
reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of
commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,
such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is
generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)
logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;
ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately
related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central
conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As
such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known
results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on
FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts
and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from
expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we
additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from
the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive
evaluation framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合分布式和符号表示的‘模型合成架构’（MSA），用于模拟人类在开放领域中的推理能力，并通过实验验证其优于纯语言模型基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类如何在新情境中整合广泛背景知识进行推理，并提出计算模型以模拟这一能力。

Method: 提出MSA架构，结合语言模型（实现全局检索）和概率程序（实现定制化世界模型），并在‘Model Olympics’数据集上评估。

Result: MSA在人类判断模拟上优于纯语言模型，支持其在开放领域推理中的有效性。

Conclusion: MSA为理解和复制人类开放领域推理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型（LMs）可以通过模态差异向量更可靠地分类句子模态，且这些向量与人类分类行为相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LMs是否能可靠分类句子模态，并揭示其与人类模态分类的潜在联系。

Method: 识别LMs中的模态差异向量，分析其与模型能力的关系，并与人类分类行为对比。

Result: LMs的模态分类能力优于之前报告，且模态差异向量与人类分类行为高度相关。

Conclusion: 模态差异向量为理解LMs和人类模态分类提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLP模型（尤其是BioClinicalBERT）能高效分类药物过量死亡报告，优于传统方法和通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决药物过量死亡数据因手工编码ICD-10导致的延迟和信息丢失问题。

Method: 使用35,433份2020年死亡记录训练模型，并通过3,335份2023-2024年记录验证。评估多种NLP方法，包括传统分类器和微调的语言模型（如BERT、BioClinicalBERT、Qwen 3、Llama 3）。

Result: BioClinicalBERT在内部测试集上表现近乎完美（F1>=0.998），外部验证也表现优异（F1=0.966）。

Conclusion: NLP模型（尤其是BioClinicalBERT）能显著提升药物过量监测效率，支持实时趋势检测。

Abstract: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.

TL;DR: AdaptiSent是一个用于多模态基于方面的情感分析（MABSA）的新框架，通过自适应跨模态注意力机制提升情感分类和方面词提取的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理多模态数据时未能充分利用文本和图像之间的交互关系，AdaptiSent旨在通过动态模态加权和上下文自适应注意力解决这一问题。

Method: AdaptiSent采用动态模态加权和上下文自适应注意力机制，专注于文本线索和视觉上下文的交互，以提取情感和方面相关信息。

Result: 在标准Twitter数据集上的测试表明，AdaptiSent在精确率、召回率和F1分数上优于现有模型，尤其在识别跨模态关系方面表现突出。

Conclusion: AdaptiSent为MABSA设立了新标准，显著优于现有方法，特别是在理解复杂多模态信息方面。

Abstract: We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms
to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text
and images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and
context-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and
aspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context
interact. We tested our approach against several baselines, including
traditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from
standard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in
precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying
nuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and
aspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to
adjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the
depth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.
AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current
methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

TL;DR: 论文提出了AudioJudge，一种基于大型音频模型（LAM）的统一评估框架，解决了现有语音评估的两个关键问题：针对特定音频特性的系统设计困难，以及自动评估方法与人类偏好相关性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音评估存在两个关键限制：需要为不同音频特性设计专门系统，且自动评估方法与人类偏好相关性差。

Method: 通过探索AudioJudge在音频特性检测任务（如发音、语速、说话人识别和语音质量）和系统级人类偏好模拟中的应用，研究不同提示工程策略，发现音频拼接结合上下文学习显著提升性能。

Result: 提出的多角度集成AudioJudge在系统排名基准测试中与人类偏好的Spearman相关性达到0.91。

Conclusion: LAM在音频噪声下表现稳健，但存在冗长和位置偏差问题，需谨慎缓解。

Abstract: Current speech evaluation suffers from two critical limitations: the need and
difficulty of designing specialized systems targeting individual audio
characteristics, and poor correlation between automatic evaluation methods and
human preferences. This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model
(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified
evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore
AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including
pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and
system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We
investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio
concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves
performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference
simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to
enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes
speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,
and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with
human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals
that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit
significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型的分词器在适应新数据分布时表现僵硬，导致对新领域或语言的过度分词，影响性能。

Method: 开发了基于字节的语言模型，通过可学习的分词器动态预测输入字节序列的分割边界，并提出简化的训练目标FLEXITOKENS。

Result: 在多语言基准测试和形态多样性任务中，FLEXITOKENS显著减少了过度分词，下游任务性能提升高达10%。

Conclusion: FLEXITOKENS通过灵活的分词机制，有效提升了语言模型对新数据分布的适应能力。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by
simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,
which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often
leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of
out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we
develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.
Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the
input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing
tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss
that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing
a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective
that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating
across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and
domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token
over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task
performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and
data for our experiments will be released at

Motivation: 开发一个能够提供细粒度翻译评估和排名的系统，以改进现有翻译质量评估方法。

Method: 使用基于提示的推理方法，结合多维质量指标（MQM）进行评估，并利用大型语言模型（如Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct）进行评分。

Result: TransEvalnia在英语-日语及其他WMT语言对中表现优于或等同于MT-Ranker，其评分与人类评分高度相关。

Conclusion: TransEvalnia是一个有效的翻译评估工具，但存在位置偏差问题，提出了解决方法并公开了所有数据与代码。

Abstract: We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking
system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This
system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (https://themqm.org/), returns an assessment
of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the
various dimensions and for the overall translation. We show that TransEvalnia
performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al.
2024) on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from
various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations
returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores
assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well
with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our
system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are
presented, and we propose methods to address this position bias. All data,
including the system's evaluation and reasoning, human assessments, as well as
code is released.

Motivation: 现有基于提示工程的狼人杀智能体策略隐含且无法适应动态变化，需改进为显式策略选择。

Result: 验证了所提方法在适应性和性能上的有效性。

Conclusion: 显式策略选择方法能显著提升狼人杀智能体的动态适应能力。

Abstract: This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by
switching between predefined strategies based on the attitudes of other players
and the context of conversations. While prior works of Werewolf agents using
prompt engineering have employed methods where effective strategies are
implicitly defined, they cannot adapt to changing situations. In this research,
we propose a method that explicitly selects an appropriate strategy based on
the game context and the estimated roles of other players. We compare the
strategy adaptation Werewolf agents with baseline agents using implicit or
fixed strategies and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TL;DR: ThinkLogit是一种解码时方法，通过小模型引导大模型进行长链推理，无需额外训练，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否能在不训练的情况下激发大模型的长链推理能力。

Method: 提出ThinkLogit方法，利用对数算术调整目标大模型，并通过小模型引导；进一步提出ThinkLogit-DPO，通过偏好优化训练引导模型。

Result: 在四个数学数据集上，ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO分别相对提升26%和29%的pass@1性能。

Conclusion: ThinkLogit是一种高效方法，能以最小或无需额外训练的方式激发大模型的长链推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过从大语言模型中蒸馏数据来提高文本编码器否定鲁棒性的策略，同时保持了通用任务的竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自回归大语言模型快速普及，但小型文本编码器在需要丰富上下文表示的任务中仍很重要。否定语义功能未被现有方法充分捕捉，影响了依赖文本嵌入的下游应用。

Method: 通过从大语言模型中蒸馏多样化的否定和模糊模式数据，采用对比学习微调BERT模型。

Result: 显著提升了否定理解能力，同时在通用基准测试中保持竞争力。该方法也可适配大语言模型，提升否定基准表现。

Conclusion: 提出的策略有效提升了文本编码器的否定鲁棒性，并展示了其在大语言模型中的适应性。

Abstract: Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text
encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require
rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function
that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream
applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve
negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language
models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard
contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and
observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while
maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also
show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on
negation benchmarks.

TL;DR: LLMs能生成符号音乐数据，但缺乏显式音乐训练，表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs如何隐式建模符号音乐，填补研究空白。

Method: 通过文本提示生成MIDI数据，训练神经网络进行音乐分类和旋律补全。

Result: LLMs能推断基本音乐结构和时间关系，但表现受限于缺乏显式音乐背景。

Conclusion: LLMs在符号音乐生成中有潜力，但需进一步优化以提升表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了跨语言一致性对事实知识的影响，分析了多语言模型在不同语言间的知识一致性表现，并探讨了提升一致性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估跨语言迁移能力、保持模型知识的事实性以及语言模型性能的均衡性，需要关注跨语言一致性。

Method: 通过分析代码混合的共指陈述，使用可解释性方法研究多语言模型的行为，并评估提升多语言性能的策略。

Result: 多语言模型在不同语言家族和语言因素下表现出一致性差异，代码切换训练和跨语言词对齐目标表现最佳。

Conclusion: 跨语言对齐监督和代码切换训练对提升多语言性能和跨语言一致性至关重要。

Abstract: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual
transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across
languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus
interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency
for factual knowledge. We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed
identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge
consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of
a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show
different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic
factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer.
In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual
performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge
consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency
in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment
objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of
cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both
multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.

Conclusion: 研究表明分层解码器架构具有潜力，未来可探索从头预训练的分层推理模型。

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

Result: 在任务中达到85%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过代码生成和优化提示有效提升了表格问答任务的性能。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas
y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

Abstract: Organizations face an ever-changing threat landscape. They must continuously
dedicate significant efforts to protect their assets, making their adoption of
increased cybersecurity automation inevitable. However, process automation
requires formalization of input data. Through this paper, we address this need
for processes that use attack scenarios as input. Among these processes, one
can mention both the generation of scripts for attack simulation and training
purposes, as well as the analysis of attacks. Therefore, the paper's main
research contribution is a novel formal model that encompasses the attack's
context description and its scenario. It is abstracted using UML class model.
Once the description of our model done, we will show how it could serve an
upstream attack analysis process. We will show also its use for an automatic
generation of attack scripts in the context of cybersecurity training. These
two uses cases constitute the second contribution of this present research
work.

Result: 在SciRepEval基准测试中达到同类模型的最先进性能，验证了语义聚焦训练的优势。

Conclusion: SemCSE通过语义聚焦训练显著提升了科学文本嵌入的质量，为语义相似性任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

Abstract: This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to
identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is
reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive
science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language
processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and
other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),
highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we
plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated
dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional
discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based
retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth
adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will
be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

Motivation: 理解标注变异性来源对开发公平的NLP系统至关重要，尤其是涉及人口统计偏见的任务（如性别歧视检测）。

Method: 使用广义线性混合模型量化人口统计特征对标注的影响，并评估生成式AI作为标注者的可靠性。

Result: 人口统计因素仅占8%的方差，推文内容是主导因素；生成式AI的简单人口统计提示通常无效。

Conclusion: 关注内容驱动的解释和稳健的标注协议比模拟人口统计特征更可靠。

Abstract: Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for
developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where
demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which
annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text
content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,
finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a
minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the
dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models
as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic
personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that
simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,
performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)
techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific
tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic
characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and
robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than
potentially persona simulation.

Method: 使用简单的机器学习方法分析四至五岁儿童的录音故事，比较了阿非利卡语和科萨语的数据。

Result: 词汇多样性和句子长度是典型发展的指标，特定动词和助动词的使用与干预需求减少相关，但发音速率信息较少。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言特异性和共享的叙事能力预测因素，对多语言背景下的早期评估具有指导意义。

Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development.
This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were
identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning
methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-
and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify
lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance
length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation
rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in
part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated
with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of
requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages
reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,
with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

Motivation: 现有评估仅关注最终输出的正确性，忽略了低效通信和协调导致的冗余推理和高计算成本。

Method: 引入GEMMAS框架，建模智能体交互为有向无环图，提出IDS和UPR两个过程级指标。

Result: 在GSM8K基准测试中，准确率仅差2.1%的系统在IDS和UPR上差异显著（12.8%和80%），揭示了协作质量的巨大差异。

Conclusion: 仅依赖结果指标不足以评估多智能体性能，过程级诊断对设计更高效和可解释的协作AI系统至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on language models have shown strong performance on
collaborative reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluations focus only on the
correctness of the final output, overlooking how inefficient communication and
poor coordination contribute to redundant reasoning and higher computational
costs. We introduce GEMMAS, a graph-based evaluation framework that analyzes
the internal collaboration process by modeling agent interactions as a directed
acyclic graph. To capture collaboration quality, we propose two process-level
metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) to measure semantic variation in
inter-agent messages, and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to quantify redundant
reasoning paths. We evaluate GEMMAS across five benchmarks and highlight
results on GSM8K, where systems with only a 2.1% difference in accuracy differ
by 12.8% in IDS and 80% in UPR, revealing substantial variation in internal
collaboration. These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are
insufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the
importance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and
resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical
for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to
accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for
automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and
isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine
learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For
scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language
model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases,
but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based
system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require
intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in
classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for
children's learning.

Method: 分析LLMs潜在空间中的激活模式，提出CAST框架，通过选择高资源任务中的多样样本并利用其对比表示增强的激活来适应低资源任务。

Result: 在跨领域和跨语言迁移实验中，CAST优于基线方法，展现出更高的可扩展性和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: CAST通过潜在空间操纵实现了高效的跨任务知识迁移，为LLMs在低资源场景下的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging
pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen
tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context
learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it
still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and
efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be
achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input
expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of
LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples
have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we
propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that
enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation
states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from
high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced
activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across
both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method
outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and
lower computational costs.

While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在跨模态推理方面表现出色，但也面临对抗性多模态输入的安全隐患。

Method: AutoSteer包含三个核心组件：安全感知评分（SAS）、自适应安全探针和轻量级拒绝头，用于识别和干预安全风险。

Result: 实验表明，AutoSteer显著降低了文本、视觉和跨模态威胁的攻击成功率（ASR），同时保持模型的一般能力。

Conclusion: AutoSteer为多模态AI系统的安全部署提供了实用、可解释且有效的框架。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

Method: 提出QuestA策略，通过在训练中引入部分解决方案来增强问题，从而降低难度并优化学习信号。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，QuestA显著提升了pass@1和pass@k性能，并在多个基准测试中达到新的最优结果（如AIME24、AIME25和HMMT25）。

Conclusion: QuestA不仅提升了强化学习的样本效率，还为扩展推理能力提供了一种实用且可推广的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

Motivation: 现有方法生成的演示存在逻辑不一致和布局不佳的问题，难以达到专业标准。

Method: RCPS整合深度结构化叙事规划、自适应布局生成和迭代优化；PREVAL采用基于偏好多维模型评估演示质量。

Result: RCPS在内容、连贯性和设计上显著优于基线方法，PREVAL与人工评估高度相关。

Conclusion: RCPS和PREVAL为高质量演示生成和评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality media presentations is challenging,
requiring robust content extraction, narrative planning, visual design, and
overall quality optimization. Existing methods often produce presentations with
logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet
professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS
(Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating
three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive
Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose
PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced
multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content,
Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly
outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing
presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows
strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated
tool for assessing presentation quality.

Motivation: 为评估LLMs在设计消融研究中的能力，填补现有基准的空白。

Method: 基于807篇NLP论文构建1500个专家标注示例，任务为LLMs生成消融研究设计。评估了DeepSeek-R1-0528和o4-mini等模型。

Result: LLMs与人类专家在消融研究设计上存在显著差距，现有自动化评估方法不可靠。

Conclusion: 开发AbGen-Eval评估自动化评估系统的可靠性，为未来LLM评估系统研究提供方向。

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了HapticCap数据集，用于解决触觉信号与文本描述匹配的挑战，并提出了一种基于对比学习的检索任务方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计有意义的触觉信号具有挑战性，现有数据集和模型在描述触觉信号方面能力有限。

Method: 创建HapticCap数据集，提出基于对比学习的触觉-文本检索任务，结合T5语言模型和AST音频模型。

Result: T5和AST模型的组合在触觉-文本检索任务中表现最佳，尤其在分类训练时效果更好。

Conclusion: HapticCap数据集和提出的方法为触觉信号与文本描述的匹配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Haptic signals, from smartphone vibrations to virtual reality touch feedback,
can effectively convey information and enhance realism, but designing signals
that resonate meaningfully with users is challenging. To facilitate this, we
introduce a multimodal dataset and task, of matching user descriptions to
vibration haptic signals, and highlight two primary challenges: (1) lack of
large haptic vibration datasets annotated with textual descriptions as
collecting haptic descriptions is time-consuming, and (2) limited capability of
existing tasks and models to describe vibration signals in text. To advance
this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated
haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user
descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations.
Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present
the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that
brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations.
Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the
best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when
separately trained for each description category.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索搜索引擎和用户意识形态查询如何共同导致搜索结果偏见，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 分析主要搜索引擎在政治和社会话题上的输出数据。

Result: 搜索引擎优先排序内容反映偏见，用户意识形态查询进一步加剧偏见，不同搜索引擎在来源优先排序上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 搜索引擎通过强化意识形态分歧可能加剧信息极化，影响公众认知。

Abstract: Search engines play a crucial role in shaping public discourse by influencing
how information is accessed and framed. While prior research has extensively
examined various dimensions of search bias -- such as content prioritization,
indexical bias, political polarization, and sources of bias -- an important
question remains underexplored: how do search engines and
ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results. This
study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political
and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize
content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that
ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the
amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were
observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize. These
results suggest that search engines may play a pivotal role in shaping public
perceptions by reinforcing ideological divides, thereby contributing to the
broader issue of information polarization.

Motivation: 探讨视觉-语言（VL）训练是否显著改变语言模型的词汇概念知识及其分类组织。

Method: 通过比较纯文本语言模型和VL训练模型在文本问答任务中的表现，结合行为和分析方法。

Result: VL模型在需要分类理解的问答任务中表现更好，但分类知识本身未显著改变。

Conclusion: VL训练未显著改变分类知识，但提升了任务中知识的运用能力。

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在长度泛化任务中的局限性，探索更通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出TAIL方法，合成模仿图灵机执行过程的CoT数据，优化推理步骤和数据访问机制。

Result: TAIL显著提升Qwen2.5-7B模型在多种任务上的性能，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 图灵机中的关键概念对长度泛化至关重要，为LLM推理学习提供新方向。

Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than
those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based
large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly
focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic
manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited
overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a
broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that
algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this
perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to
improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes
chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing
Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into
atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch
mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in
elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we
construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and
18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length
generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various
tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.
The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,
instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length
generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors
consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.
This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of
LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为“上下文工程”的正式学科，旨在系统优化大型语言模型（LLMs）的信息负载，并分析了其基础组件和高级实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的性能高度依赖于推理时的上下文信息，但现有研究缺乏系统性的优化方法，因此需要建立上下文工程的框架。

Method: 论文通过分析1300多篇研究论文，将上下文工程分解为基础组件（如上下文检索、生成、处理和管理）和高级实现（如检索增强生成、记忆系统和多智能体系统）。

Result: 研究发现，尽管通过上下文工程增强了模型对复杂上下文的理解能力，但在生成长篇输出方面仍存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 论文为上下文感知AI的研究和工程提供了统一框架，并指出解决生成能力与理解能力之间的不对称性是未来研究的重点。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,
this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers
advancing context-aware AI.

Motivation: 现有计算幽默研究集中于简短双关笑话，缺乏对复杂幽默形式的探索。

Method: 构建包含600个笑话的数据集，涵盖4种类型，并手动编写高质量解释，比较多种LLMs的零样本解释能力。

Result: 测试的LLMs（包括推理模型）均无法可靠生成对所有笑话类型的充分解释。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了计算幽默领域对简单笑话形式的过度关注，以及LLMs在解释复杂幽默方面的局限性。

Abstract: Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,
whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on
short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour
form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that
requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a
dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality
explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,
contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on
reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding
news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot
abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of
different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour
explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are
capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further
highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly
simple joke forms.

Abstract: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that
(1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2)
grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal
embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3)
restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected

best configuration not only outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在3D动态场景推理任务中表现不佳，缺乏对3D动态的内部建模能力。

Result: 在SAT空间推理基准测试中，平均性能提升超过8%，且无需微调。

Conclusion: MindJourney展示了通过世界模型进行测试时扩展的潜力，为3D推理提供了一种简单、即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

Motivation: 现有单模态MLLM在视觉编码和语言解码集成时存在优化不稳定和灾难性遗忘的问题，需要一种更稳定的学习方法和高效的预训练策略。

Method: 提出Mono-InternVL，通过多模态专家混合架构嵌入视觉参数空间，并设计EViP预训练方法；进一步改进为Mono-InternVL-1.5，引入视觉注意力专家和高效预训练流程。

Conclusion: Mono-InternVL系列模型通过创新的设计和预训练策略，显著提升了单模态MLLM的性能和效率。

Abstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

Abstract: Understanding radiologists' eye movement during Computed Tomography (CT)
reading is crucial for developing effective interpretable computer-aided
diagnosis systems. However, CT research in this area has been limited by the
lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the three-dimensional
complexity of CT volumes. To address these challenges, we present the first
publicly available eye gaze dataset on CT, called CT-ScanGaze. Then, we
introduce CT-Searcher, a novel 3D scanpath predictor designed specifically to
process CT volumes and generate radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences,
overcoming the limitations of current scanpath predictors that only handle 2D
inputs. Since deep learning models benefit from a pretraining step, we develop
a pipeline that converts existing 2D gaze datasets into 3D gaze data to
pretrain CT-Searcher. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
CT-ScanGaze, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a
comprehensive assessment framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical
imaging.

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree

all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on

resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at

Abstract: Action anticipation has become a prominent topic in Human Action Recognition
(HAR). However, its application to real-world sports scenarios remains limited
by the availability of suitable annotated datasets. This work presents a novel
dataset of manually annotated soccer penalty kicks to predict shot direction
based on pre-kick player movements. We propose a deep learning classifier to
benchmark this dataset that integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with
contextual metadata. We evaluate twenty-two backbone models across seven
architecture families (MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D),
achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the
dataset's value for anticipatory action recognition and validate our model's
potential as a generalizable approach for sports-based predictive tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Funnel-HOI的框架，通过在编码器阶段引入HOI特定线索，结合非对称共注意力机制和新颖的损失函数，显著提升了人-物交互检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人-物交互组合数量庞大，标注数据有限，导致长尾分布问题。现有方法主要集中在改进解码器，而忽略了在编码器阶段引入HOI特定线索的重要性。

Method: 提出Funnel-HOI框架，先检测物体（明确概念），再关联动作（抽象概念），利用非对称共注意力机制挖掘多模态信息，并设计新的损失函数优化交互分类器。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO数据集上的实验表明，Funnel-HOI在完全监督和零样本设置下均达到最先进性能，未见和罕见HOI类别的性能分别提升12.4%和8.4%。

Conclusion: Funnel-HOI通过在编码器阶段引入HOI特定线索，显著提升了人-物交互检测的性能，尤其在零样本场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric
co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information
(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction
representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that
considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty
better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.
Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across
fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art
performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI
categories, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在动态场景新视角合成中依赖昂贵优化或无法保持几何一致性的问题。

Method: 结合动态3D重建和自监督2D视频扩散模型，通过可见像素渲染和隐藏像素修复实现新视角合成。

Result: CogNVS在单目视频动态场景新视角合成任务中表现优于大多数现有方法。

Conclusion: CogNVS通过自监督学习和零样本适应，为动态场景新视角合成提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

TL;DR: 该研究首次结合视网膜微血管特征与血清脂质组学数据，通过深度学习分析，揭示了心血管疾病早期无症状生物标志物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，但现有风险分层方法常无法检测早期亚临床变化，需探索更有效的早期指标。

Method: 采用创新的影像组学框架，结合深度学习提取的视网膜微血管特征与血清脂质组学数据，进行大规模协变量调整和分层相关性分析。

Result: 研究发现视网膜微血管特征（如平均动脉宽度、血管密度）与特定脂质亚类（如TAGs、DAGs、Cers）存在显著相关性，提示代谢压力下的微血管重塑机制。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了早期心血管疾病发病机制的认知空白，为无创生物标志物发现和个性化心血管健康管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained

Abstract: We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,
gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been
made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor
Frame + Animation" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with
smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will
be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for
video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

Conclusion: Mamba Snake通过状态空间建模和双分类协同机制，显著提升了UMIS的性能，适用于复杂解剖结构的精确分割。

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly

Abstract: This paper introduces an autonomous UAV vision system for continuous,
real-time tracking of marine animals, specifically sharks, in dynamic marine
environments. The system integrates an onboard computer with a stabilised RGB-D
camera and a custom-trained OSTrack pipeline, enabling visual identification
under challenging lighting, occlusion, and sea-state conditions. A key
innovation is the inter-UAV handoff protocol, which enables seamless transfer
of tracking responsibilities between drones, extending operational coverage
beyond single-drone battery limitations. Performance is evaluated on a curated
shark dataset of 5,200 frames, achieving a tracking success rate of 81.9\%
during real-time flight control at 100 Hz, and robustness to occlusion,
illumination variation, and background clutter. We present a seamless UAV
handoff framework, where target transfer is attempted via high-confidence
feature matching, achieving 82.9\% target coverage. These results confirm the
viability of coordinated UAV operations for extended marine tracking and lay
the groundwork for scalable, autonomous monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务无关的动作范式ATARA和AnyPos模型，显著提高了数据收集效率和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉-语言-动作模型依赖任务特定的人类演示，泛化性差且数据获取成本高。

Method: 引入ATARA框架进行自监督数据收集，结合AnyPos逆动力学模型和方向感知解码器优化学习。

Result: 实验显示，AnyPos-ATARA管道在测试准确率上提升51%，下游任务成功率提高30-40%。

Conclusion: 任务无关范式显著提升了模型的效率和性能，适用于多样化操作任务。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Stable Diffusion等图像生成模型中注意力操作的高计算复杂度问题，同时避免现有令牌合并方法对图像生成特性的忽视。

Method: 提出局部代表性令牌引导合并（ReToM），通过定义窗口边界、调整窗口大小，并选择最具代表性的令牌进行合并。

Result: 实验结果显示，ReToM在FID上提升了6.2%，CLIP分数更高，同时保持推理时间接近基线。

Conclusion: ReToM在视觉质量和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡，适用于任何基于注意力的图像生成模型。

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: KCR-Transformer是一种高效且理论支持的视觉Transformer改进方法。

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模视觉语言模型（LVLMs）主要针对室内场景，难以应对户外大尺度场景的复杂性和多模态数据缺失问题。

Method: 构建SVM-City数据集，包含多尺度、多视角和多模态数据；设计City-VLM模型，采用不完全多模态学习和联合概率分布空间进行多模态融合。

Result: City-VLM在问答任务中平均性能提升18.14%，优于现有LVLMs。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种户外场景中表现出实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

Result: 实验表明DeQA-Doc在多种退化类型下均显著优于现有基线，具有高准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: DeQA-Doc为文档质量评估提供了高效解决方案，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Sage的新方法，通过语义引导微调基础模型，解决长尾视觉识别中类别样本不平衡导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾场景中类别样本数量的不平衡导致低频类别性能下降，基础模型因其通用性表示能力具有潜力，但现有方法忽视了视觉与文本模态的对齐。

Method: 提出Sage方法，通过SG-Adapter将类别描述的语义引导融入视觉编码器微调，并设计分布不匹配感知补偿因子以纠正预测偏差。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，Sage能有效提升长尾学习性能。

Conclusion: Sage通过语义引导和分布补偿，显著改善了长尾视觉识别的性能。

Abstract: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答方法主要依赖事件中心的问答对，缺乏对视频更广泛上下文的理解，限制了模型的泛化和推理能力。

Method: FIQ通过从视频中提取描述生成问答对，并结合VQ-CAlign模块将问题嵌入与视觉特征对齐，以保留关键领域细节。

Result: 在SUTD-TrafficQA数据集上，FIQ表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FIQ通过增强对视频基本内容的理解，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和推理性能。

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本CIR方法存在信息丢失和跨模态交互不足的问题，尤其是VLM-LLM流水线和MLLM方法未能充分利用视觉上下文信息。

Method: MCoT-RE利用多角度思维链生成两种描述（修改导向和视觉上下文导向），并通过两阶段重排序（过滤和多粒度重排序）实现精确检索。

Result: 在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上，MCoT-RE分别提升了6.24%和8.58%的召回率，达到训练免费方法中的最佳性能。

Conclusion: MCoT-RE通过平衡文本修改和视觉上下文，显著提升了零样本CIR的效果，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from
a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

Motivation: 现有方法在视觉和文本模态融合上存在不足，早期融合忽视视觉上下文，晚期融合难以捕捉细粒度语义对齐。

Method: FAR-Net采用多阶段融合框架，包括增强语义对齐模块（ESAM）和自适应协调模块（ARM），分别通过交叉注意力和不确定性嵌入优化融合效果。

Result: 在CIRR和FashionIQ数据集上，FAR-Net在Recall@1和Recall@50指标上分别提升了2.4%和1.04%。

Conclusion: FAR-Net为组合图像检索任务提供了鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance

Abstract: Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and
instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and
reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap
Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We
introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that
enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal
captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions
from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to
generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable
multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set

Abstract: Image captioning has emerged as a crucial task in the intersection of
computer vision and natural language processing, enabling automated generation
of descriptive text from visual content. In the context of remote sensing,
image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex
satellite imagery, aiding applications such as environmental monitoring,

captioning (RSIC) in which multiple techniques of Static Expansion,
Memory-Augmented Self-Attention, Mesh Transformer are evaluated and integrated.
We evaluate our proposed models using two benchmark remote sensing image
datasets of UCM-Caption and NWPU-Caption. Our best model outperforms the
state-of-the-art systems on most of evaluation metrics, which demonstrates
potential to apply for real-life remote sensing image systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SRE的注意力重聚焦方法，用于解决CLIP在域泛化中难以关注任务相关区域的问题。通过模拟域偏移、注意力重聚焦和集成学习，SRE显著提升了在未见目标域上的性能。


<details>

Motivation: CLIP在域泛化中难以关注任务相关的域不变区域，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出SRE方法，包括模拟域偏移、注意力重聚焦和集成学习。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SRE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SRE通过注意力重聚焦有效减少了域偏移，提升了域泛化性能。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

Method: 提出SCORE框架，包括区域感知集成（优化类嵌入）和全局上下文适应（丰富文本嵌入），以增强对象区分性和语言潜在空间表达。

Result: 实验表明，SCORE在开放词汇遥感实例分割任务中达到SOTA性能，为大规模地理空间分析提供稳健解决方案。

Conclusion: SCORE通过整合多粒度上下文，显著提升了开放词汇遥感实例分割的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在推理分割任务中受限于低分辨率预训练，导致感知分辨率低，性能提升有限且计算成本高。

Method: 提出HRSeg模型，包含HRP模块（通过裁剪处理高分辨率图像，整合局部和全局特征）和HRE模块（通过高分辨率图像增强掩码特征，优化与文本特征的对齐）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，HRSeg性能优越，模块有效性通过消融研究验证。

Conclusion: HRSeg通过高效的高分辨率感知和增强，显著提升了推理分割任务的性能。

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that
leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes

dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by
head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose,
we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out
cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free
bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于摄像头的情感识别方法，通过整合注视固定模式、环境语义和时间动态来实现用户无感知的实时情感识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别方法依赖显式信号（如面部表情、语音、手势），容易被掩饰且忽略环境上下文；生理信号方法需要复杂传感器，影响自然行为；现有注视分析方法只关注静态固定点，无法捕捉注视与环境的动态交互

Method: 使用标准高清摄像头在自然环境中捕捉用户眼部外观和头部运动，估计时空注视轨迹，建模注视行为的空间、语义和时间维度，捕捉视觉注意力与周围环境之间的动态相互作用

Result: 实现了用户无感知、实时、连续的情感识别，具有高泛化性和低部署成本

Conclusion: 情感不仅仅是生理反应，而是人-环境交互的复杂结果；通过整合注视模式与环境语义的动态分析，可以在无需专门硬件或用户主动参与的情况下实现有效的情感识别

Abstract: Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车道检测是ADAS和ADS的关键组件，但领域偏移会影响模型可靠性。传统方法需要大量标注数据，资源消耗大。本文旨在开发一种无需标签的性能估计方法。

Method: 论文首先将五种图像分类的性能估计方法适配到车道检测任务，建立基线。然后提出LanePerf框架，结合图像和车道特征，使用预训练编码器和DeepSets架构。

Result: 在OpenLane数据集上的实验表明，LanePerf优于基线方法，MAE为0.117，Spearman相关系数为0.727。

Conclusion: LanePerf为ADAS提供了高效的标签无关性能估计方法，提升了在复杂驾驶场景中的测试效率和安全性。

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

Result: 实验表明，两种新算法在新数据集上性能优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 本文为联邦学习领域提供了首个专用数据集和两种高效算法，推动了隐私保护机器学习的发展。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

Result: 模型在AthleticsPose上训练后，MPJPE降低约75%，但高速运动指标存在预测偏差。

Conclusion: 真实运动数据对模型性能至关重要，同时揭示了单目3D姿态估计在体育分析中的潜力与局限。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

Result: 实验表明，Argus在多种下游任务中优于现有3D-LMMs。

Conclusion: Argus通过多模态输入扩展LLMs的3D任务能力，有效弥补3D点云重建的信息丢失问题。

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

Result: 在OCR任务中表现优异，同时在简单任务中节省大量视觉标记。

Conclusion: VisionThink在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

Conclusion: DMQ方法有效解决了扩散模型量化中的关键问题，为资源受限环境提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

Result: 在两个挑战性数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型提取模态不变特征和跨模态身份识别的能力。

Abstract: To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: 理解多模态输入中不同模态间的不确定性关系及其在临床应用中的潜在价值。

Method: 提出MUPM模型，通过不确定性传播分析图像、文本及联合模态的不确定性，并在心脏MR扫描和数字健康记录数据上进行优化和验证。

Result: MUPM在少量样本下鲁棒优化，可迁移至不同数据分布和下游任务，并直接应用于临床疾病预测任务中的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: MUPM通过量化不确定性关系，为临床应用提供了高效且实用的工具，尤其在数据冗余识别和不确定性估计方面。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决学习型单目视觉里程计在鲁棒性、泛化性和效率上的挑战，尤其是DINOv2模型在VO中因特征粒度粗而应用受限的问题。

Method: 提出DINO-VO系统，结合DINOv2的稀疏特征匹配、定制关键点检测器、几何特征补充，以及基于Transformer的匹配器和可微分姿态估计层。

Result: 在TartanAir、KITTI和EuRoC数据集上优于现有帧间VO方法，运行效率达72 FPS，内存占用小于1GB，且在户外驾驶场景中与视觉SLAM系统竞争。

Conclusion: DINO-VO通过结合DINOv2的语义鲁棒性和几何特征，显著提升了单目VO的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 解决长视频生成中自注意力二次复杂度的问题，同时保持时间连贯性和可扩展性。

Method: 采用FlexFormer作为自动编码器，联合压缩视频和文本为统一潜在表示，支持可变长度输入和单查询令牌设计。

Result: 在多样化任务中验证了方法的有效性和多功能性。

Conclusion: LoViC框架在长视频生成中表现出色，支持多种生成任务。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自进化的视觉语言导航框架（SE-VLN），通过结合分层记忆、检索增强推理和反思模块，实现了在测试中持续进化的能力，显著提升了导航成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的视觉语言导航方法受限于固定知识库和推理能力，无法有效融入经验知识，缺乏进化能力。

Method: SE-VLN包含三个核心模块：分层记忆模块（存储成功和失败案例）、检索增强推理模块（多步决策）和反思模块（持续进化）。

Result: 在未见环境中，SE-VLN的导航成功率分别达到57%和35.2%，比现有最佳方法提升了23.9%和15.0%。

Conclusion: SE-VLN展示了作为自进化框架的巨大潜力，其性能随经验库增长而提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DIR框架中正则化参数调优计算成本高，需要多次训练迭代，cIDIR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: cIDIR利用INRs，在正则化超参数的先验分布上进行训练，并通过分割掩码优化超参数，同时建模连续可微的变形向量场（DVF）。

Result: 在DIR-LAB数据集上，cIDIR表现出高精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: cIDIR通过条件化正则化超参数和连续可微的DVF，显著提升了DIR的效率和性能。

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

Conclusion: 连续自回归模型比离散令牌模型更鲁棒且性能更强，研究支持其优势。

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

TL;DR: FantasyPortrait是一个基于扩散变换器的框架，用于从静态图像生成高质量、情感丰富的单人和多人面部动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨重演和捕捉细微情感方面存在不足，且缺乏对多人动画的支持。

Method: 采用表达增强学习策略和掩码交叉注意力机制，结合隐式表示和独立协调的表达式生成。

Result: 在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有方法，尤其在跨重演和多人场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: FantasyPortrait为高质量面部动画提供了有效解决方案，并推动了多人动画领域的研究。

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

Conclusion: 生成AI在解决DNN训练数据稀缺问题中具有潜力，但也存在局限性。

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially
enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity
and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a
novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic

These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

Conclusion: $S^2M^2$在全局匹配架构中实现了高精度与高效率的统一，为立体匹配领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于预训练RGB-LDM的两阶段方法，用于从RGB图像重建高光谱图像（HSI），通过分离不可观测特征并建模其与RGB图像的联合分布，实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像重建（SR）的关键挑战在于从RGB图像中估计不可观测的光谱特征，这些特征包含RGB传感器未捕获的重要光谱信息。

Method: 扩展RGB预训练的潜在扩散模型（RGB-LDM）为不可观测特征LDM（ULDM），通过两阶段流程（光谱结构表示学习和光谱-空间联合分布学习）实现。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在SR和下游重光照任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过分离不可观测特征并利用RGB预训练模型的空间知识，ULDM能更高效地建模光谱-空间联合分布，显著提升重建效果。

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 传统方法需要额外的条件机制（如交叉注意力）来将视觉信息与动作生成结合，导致时间和空间开销。VITA旨在消除这些模块，同时保留生成建模能力。

Method: VITA通过将潜在图像作为流源，学习从视觉到动作的内在映射，并使用自动编码器创建结构化的动作潜在空间。通过流潜在解码监督流匹配，实现端到端学习。

Result: 在ALOHA平台的双臂操作任务中，VITA表现优于或匹配现有生成策略，同时将推理延迟降低了50-130%。

Conclusion: VITA是首个仅使用MLP层解决复杂双臂操作任务的流匹配策略，展示了其高效性和简单性。

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法在减少资源需求的同时，显著降低了重训练成本，适用于资源受限硬件。

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

Conclusion: 涂鸦标注是一种高效的弱监督形式，结合动态特征调整和不确定性正则化可显著提升篡改定位性能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种近似正交微调（AOFT）策略，通过生成近似正交的向量构建低秩权重矩阵，以增强预训练视觉变换器（ViT）在下游任务中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到预训练ViT的权重矩阵具有近似正交性，而低秩适应矩阵（如LoRA和Adapter）缺乏这一特性，可能导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出AOFT策略，用单个可学习向量生成近似正交向量，构建低秩适应矩阵，使其与预训练权重矩阵性质一致。

Result: 实验表明，AOFT在多个下游图像分类任务中表现优异，验证了其增强泛化能力的有效性。

Conclusion: AOFT通过引入近似正交性，显著提升了ViT在下游任务中的泛化性能。

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond
image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable
real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at

Result: HCS在多种任务中表现出优越性能和通用性，无需额外微调即可快速理解未见场景。

Conclusion: HCS是一种即插即用的方法，适用于任何VLM，显著提升了复杂场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

Conclusion: 检测器引导的框架有效解决了标签不一致和细节不足问题，提升了数据集蒸馏的性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

Motivation: 在安全关键的机器人应用中，实时准确检测动态对象至关重要，但现有方法因多子网络联合使用导致计算成本高。

Method: 提出Channel-wise Motion Features，仅使用Pose Network提取深度特征和3D运动信息，减少计算负担。

Result: 在KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上，FPS提升约4倍，参数减少至25%，准确性相当。

Conclusion: 新方法在高效性和准确性上均优于现有技术，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Decoupled PROB通过ETOP和TDQI解决了PROB模型中的学习冲突问题，提升了开放世界目标检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界目标检测（OWOD）需要检测未知物体并增量学习新类别，但缺乏未知物体的标注数据。PROB模型虽无需伪标签，但存在对象性和类别预测的学习冲突。

Method: 提出Decoupled PROB，引入ETOP终止对象性预测，解决学习冲突；采用TDQI高效提取已知和未知物体特征。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，Decoupled PROB性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Decoupled PROB通过解耦设计有效解决了学习冲突，提升了开放世界目标检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

Conclusion: 改进的注释资源将促进姿势感知多模态推理的可靠评估和未来发展。

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 医学图像分割中注释变异性问题严重，传统深度学习方法无法捕捉注释者偏差，现有方法仅关注单一视角。

Result: 在两个公开数据集（LIDC-IDRI和NPC-170）上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffOSeg能同时实现共识和偏好驱动的分割，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

Result: 在15个基准数据集上，GLAD在基类到新类泛化、图像域泛化和跨数据集泛化方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLAD是一种简单通用的框架，显著提升了预训练模型在少样本任务中的性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual
concepts is essential for personalizing pre-trained models to meet individual
user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\% reduction in
forgetting rates and 63.3\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

Conclusion: VideoITG在视频理解中展现出显著优势和应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

*Pranav Singh,Pravendra Singh*

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合语言先验的多模态红外小目标检测框架，通过文本信息增强检测能力，并在新构建的多模态数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外小目标检测方法仅依赖图像模态，限制了性能提升，而多模态方法（结合文本信息）有望改进检测效果。

Method: 利用GPT-4生成目标位置的文本描述，通过语言引导的注意力权重增强模型检测能力，并构建了包含图像和文本的多模态数据集。

Result: 在NUAA-SIRST和IRSTD-1k子集上，IoU、nIoU、Pd和Fa指标分别显著提升，最高达67.87%。

Conclusion: 多模态框架显著提升了红外小目标检测性能，证明了语言先验的有效性。

Abstract: IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared
blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection
task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse
distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods
and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset
of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS-TinyNet是一种针对遥感图像中小目标检测的多阶段特征融合与增强模型，通过新颖的设计显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像中的小目标检测因空间信息有限、特征表示弱和背景复杂而具有挑战性，现有检测器表现不佳。

Method: 提出RS-TinyNet，包含微小目标显著性建模和特征完整性重建两个核心设计，以及三个逐步特征增强模块（MDCA、ARB和PFDH）。

Result: 在AI-TOD数据集上AP提升4.0%，AP75提升6.5%；在DIOR数据集上验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: 多阶段特征融合策略为复杂遥感环境中的小目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成视频质量的提升，检测这些内容以防止虚假信息和隐私泄露变得至关重要。

Method: 利用预训练视觉模型提取特征，并通过线性分类层区分真实与生成视频。

Result: 在包含10,000个AI生成视频和4,000个真实视频的数据集上，平均检测准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且无需额外训练，计划公开代码、模型和数据集以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

Motivation: 在线平台和电商的年龄验证常因化妆干扰而失效，需防御化妆攻击。

Method: 提出DiffClean，基于文本引导扩散模型消除化妆痕迹。

Result: 在模拟和真实化妆图像上，年龄验证准确率提升4.8%，面部识别TMR提升8.9%。

Conclusion: DiffClean有效防御化妆攻击，提升年龄和身份验证的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate age verification can protect underage users from unauthorized access
to online platforms and e-commerce sites that provide age-restricted services.
However, accurate age estimation can be confounded by several factors,
including facial makeup that can induce changes to alter perceived identity and
age to fool both humans and machines. In this work, we propose DiffClean which
erases makeup traces using a text-guided diffusion model to defend against
makeup attacks. DiffClean improves age estimation (minor vs. adult accuracy by
4.8%) and face verification (TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%) over competing baselines
on digitally simulated and real makeup images.

Conclusion: FashionPose为个性化虚拟时尚展示提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion
e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and
lighting conditions. Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting
semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we
introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation
framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D
human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person
images, and finally applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by the
same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven
conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment
rendering, and flexible lighting control. Experiments demonstrate fine-grained
pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, providing a practical

Result: 动作识别在ENIGMA-51基准上达到38.52% p-AP，物体检测AP为85.13%。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时性和准确性上表现优异，适用于流式视觉应用。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

Conclusion: 证明了在移动设备上实现实时高质量视频生成的可行性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video
generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to
significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on
mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder
(VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual
quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number
of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to
achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max,
demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on

Result: 在DNA-Rendering和ActorsHQ数据集上表现优异，生成高质量一致视频。

Conclusion: 滑动迭代去噪显著提升4D一致性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

Result: 在3D部件生成任务中达到最先进性能，生成部件可无缝组装。

Conclusion: AutoPartGen展示了强大的3D部件生成能力，适用于组合式3D重建。

Abstract: We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts
in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

Abstract: We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel
approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

Result: 在分类和回归任务中显著优于现有方法，并行训练速度提升最高达3.18倍。

Conclusion: rel-HNN框架有效捕捉了关系数据的细粒度语义，并行训练显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are ubiquitous in enterprise and real-world
applications. Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models
that rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics
from the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs)
have been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational
structures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring
intra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based
framework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair
as a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained
intra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level
representations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the
scalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a
split-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for
efficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and
benchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing
methods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our
split-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for
learning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared
to conventional single-GPU execution.

Conclusion: 论文首次在足球分析中展示了对象中心事件日志的应用，未来工作应关注变体分析和过滤技术。

Abstract: Object-centric event logs expand the conventional single-case notion event
log by considering multiple objects, allowing for the analysis of more complex
and realistic process behavior. However, the number of real-world
object-centric event logs remains limited, and further studies are needed to
test their usefulness. The increasing availability of data from team sports can
facilitate object-centric process mining, leveraging both real-world data and
suitable use cases. In this paper, we present a framework for transforming
football (soccer) data into an object-centric event log, further enhanced with
a spatial dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
generating object-centric event logs based on real-world football data and
discuss the results for varying process representations. With our paper, we
provide the first example for object-centric event logs in football analytics.
Future work should consider variant analysis and filtering techniques to better
handle variability

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验验证了算法的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: TaTIRP算法在挖掘目标时间间隔模式上表现出色，适用于大规模数据分析。

Abstract: Compared to frequent pattern mining, sequential pattern mining emphasizes the
temporal aspect and finds broad applications across various fields. However,
numerous studies treat temporal events as single time points, neglecting their
durations. Time-interval-related pattern (TIRP) mining is introduced to address
this issue and has been applied to healthcare analytics, stock prediction, etc.
Typically, mining all patterns is not only computationally challenging for
accurate forecasting but also resource-intensive in terms of time and memory.
Targeting the extraction of time-interval-related patterns based on specific
criteria can improve data analysis efficiency and better align with customer
preferences. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called TaTIRP to
discover Targeted Time-Interval Related Patterns. Additionally, we develop
multiple pruning strategies to eliminate redundant extension operations,
thereby enhancing performance on large-scale datasets. Finally, we conduct
experiments on various real-world and synthetic datasets to validate the
accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的复制协议Chora，通过工程化设计实现强同步网络（轮次时间界限在2微秒以下），并利用这种网络特性设计了高效的流水线复制协议，相比现有的单领导者和多领导者协议分别实现了255%和109%的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布式协议通常假设部分同步或完全异步的网络模型，但现代数据中心系统可以设计为在常见情况下提供强同步特性。作者认为可以利用现代数据中心的网络特性来设计更高效的复制协议。

Method: 采用内核旁路网络、多线程架构和宽松轮次长度的组合工程设计，实现了2微秒以下的严格轮次界限。基于这种强同步网络特性，设计了新的复制协议Chora，该协议能够高效地流水线化多个复制实例，同时允许所有副本并行提议而无需额外协调。

Result: 实验结果显示，Chora协议相比最先进的单领导者协议实现了255%的吞吐量提升，相比多领导者协议实现了109%的吞吐量提升。成功证明了在现代数据中心环境下强同步网络的可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: 通过工程化实现强同步网络特性，可以显著提升分布式复制协议的性能。Chora协议证明了利用网络同步特性进行协议设计的有效性，为现代数据中心分布式系统设计提供了新的思路和方法。

Abstract: Distributed systems, such as state machine replication, are critical
infrastructures for modern applications. Practical distributed protocols make
minimum assumptions about the underlying network: They typically assume a
partially synchronous or fully asynchronous network model. In this work, we
argue that modern data center systems can be designed to provide strong
synchrony properties in the common case, where servers move in synchronous
lock-step rounds. We prove this hypothesis by engineering a practical design
that uses a combination of kernel-bypass network, multithreaded architecture,
and loosened round length, achieving a tight round bound under 2us. Leveraging
our engineered networks with strong synchrony, we co-design a new replication
protocol, Chora. Chora exploits the network synchrony property to efficiently
pipeline multiple replication instances, while allowing all replicas to propose
in parallel without extra coordination. Through experiments, we show that Chora
achieves 255% and 109% improvement in throughput over state-of-the-art
single-leader and multi-leader protocols, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统微服务架构中资源分配不均、高延迟和吞吐量不足的问题。

Method: 采用基于强化学习的智能调度算法，通过代理与环境的交互持续优化资源分配策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低负载和高并发条件下显著提升响应速度和吞吐量，同时优化资源利用率和降低能耗。

Conclusion: 相比传统静态资源分配方法，强化学习模型更具适应性和优化能力，能实时调整策略以应对动态变化的环境。

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based method for microservice
resource scheduling and optimization, aiming to address issues such as uneven
resource allocation, high latency, and insufficient throughput in traditional
microservice architectures. In microservice systems, as the number of services
and the load increase, efficiently scheduling and allocating resources such as
computing power, memory, and storage becomes a critical research challenge. To
address this, the paper employs an intelligent scheduling algorithm based on
reinforcement learning. Through the interaction between the agent and the
environment, the resource allocation strategy is continuously optimized. In the
experiments, the paper considers different resource conditions and load
scenarios, evaluating the proposed method across multiple dimensions, including
response time, throughput, resource utilization, and cost efficiency. The
experimental results show that the reinforcement learning-based scheduling
method significantly improves system response speed and throughput under low
load and high concurrency conditions, while also optimizing resource
utilization and reducing energy consumption. Under multi-dimensional resource
conditions, the proposed method can consider multiple objectives and achieve
optimized resource scheduling. Compared to traditional static resource
allocation methods, the reinforcement learning model demonstrates stronger
adaptability and optimization capability. It can adjust resource allocation
strategies in real time, thereby maintaining good system performance in
dynamically changing load and resource environments.

*Xudong Wang,Hongyang Du,Lei Feng,Kaibin Huang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于生成AI增强的深度强化学习框架，用于优化6G低空移动边缘计算系统中的多用户干扰和能源效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G对低延迟计算的需求推动了基于无人机的低空移动边缘计算系统的发展，但有限的频谱资源导致地面终端间的上行链路干扰严重。

Method: 采用生成AI增强的深度强化学习框架，结合扩散模型生成高质量动作样本，并设计基于优先级的RSMA解码策略。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在低空移动边缘计算系统中优于基线方法，且结合GDM与RSMA显著提升了能源效率。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法有效解决了多用户干扰和能源效率问题，为6G低空移动边缘计算系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for low-latency computing in 6G is driving the use of
UAV-based low-altitude mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. However, limited
spectrum often leads to severe uplink interference among ground terminals
(GTs). In this paper, we investigate a rate-splitting multiple access
(RSMA)-enabled low-altitude MEC system, where a UAV-based edge server assists
multiple GTs in concurrently offloading their tasks over a shared uplink. We
formulate a joint optimization problem involving the UAV 3D trajectory, RSMA
decoding order, task offloading decisions, and resource allocation, aiming to
mitigate multi-user interference and maximize energy efficiency. Given the high
dimensionality, non-convex nature, and dynamic characteristics of this
optimization problem, we propose a generative AI-enhanced deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) framework to solve it efficiently. Specifically, we embed a
diffusion model into the actor network to generate high-quality action samples,
improving exploration in hybrid action spaces and avoiding local optima. In
addition, a priority-based RSMA decoding strategy is designed to facilitate
efficient successive interference cancellation with low complexity. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed method for low-altitude MEC systems
outperforms baseline methods, and that integrating GDM with RSMA can achieve
significantly improved energy efficiency performance.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: RIDAS是一个多智能体框架，通过表示驱动代理（RDA）和意图驱动代理（IDA）优化6G网络中的资源分配，显著提升用户容量和服务质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络需要将AI深度集成到无线接入网络（RAN）中，以解决现有解决方案在高层次用户意图与低层次参数配置之间的脱节问题。

Method: RIDAS框架包含RDA（提供可调参数接口）和IDA（基于大语言模型的两阶段规划方案），用于优化资源配置。

Result: 实验显示，RIDAS在相同QoS约束下支持的用户数量比WirelessAgent多44.71%。

Conclusion: RIDAS能有效捕捉用户意图并高效分配资源，适用于AI驱动的RAN环境。

Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) networks demand tight integration of artificial
intelligence (AI) into radio access networks (RANs) to meet stringent quality
of service (QoS) and resource efficiency requirements. Existing solutions
struggle to bridge the gap between high level user intents and the low level,
parameterized configurations required for optimal performance. To address this
challenge, we propose RIDAS, a multi agent framework composed of representation
driven agents (RDAs) and an intention driven agent (IDA). RDAs expose open
interface with tunable control parameters (rank and quantization bits, enabling
explicit trade) offs between distortion and transmission rate. The IDA employs
a two stage planning scheme (bandwidth pre allocation and reallocation) driven
by a large language model (LLM) to map user intents and system state into
optimal RDA configurations. Experiments demonstrate that RIDAS supports 44.71\%
more users than WirelessAgent under equivalent QoS constraints. These results
validate ability of RIDAS to capture user intent and allocate resources more
efficiently in AI RAN environments.

TL;DR: 6G网络为XR应用提供了低延迟和边缘计算支持，使得计算密集型任务可以从用户设备迁移到网络，降低设备电池需求并实现更小尺寸设计。


<details>

Motivation: 探索6G网络如何通过低延迟和边缘计算基础设施支持XR应用的计算任务迁移，以优化设备性能和设计。

Method: 利用6G的低延迟和边缘处理能力，将渲染等计算密集型任务从用户设备迁移到网络。

Result: 降低了用户设备的电池需求，并支持设计更小尺寸的设备。

Conclusion: 6G网络为XR应用提供了高效的卸载方案，显著提升了设备性能和设计灵活性。

Abstract: As 6G networks are developed and defined, offloading of XR applications is
emerging as one of the strong new use cases. The reduced 6G latency coupled
with edge processing infrastructure will for the first time provide a realistic
offloading scenario in cellular networks where several computationally
intensive functions, including rendering, can migrate from the user device and
into the network. A key advantage of doing so is the lowering of the battery
needs in the user devices and the possibility to design new devices with
smaller form factors.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了双向错误信息年龄（BAoII）来量化虚拟动态环境（VDE）中因信息不准确或过时而导致的惩罚，并通过马尔可夫链模型推导了长期BAoII的闭式解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟动态环境（如元宇宙和数字孪生）需要准确且实时的实体表示，以确保无缝交互和系统可靠性。

Method: 提出BAoII概念，扩展了单向错误信息年龄，通过连续时间马尔可夫链模型推导闭式解，并确定最优更新策略的传输成本阈值。

Result: 数值模拟验证了BAoII对系统性能评估的影响，并揭示了通信成本与信息新鲜度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: BAoII为元宇宙和数字孪生中的实时协作提供了重要参考，强调了信息准确性和更新策略的关键作用。

Abstract: Virtual dynamic environments (VDEs) such as the Metaverse and digital twins
(DTs) require proper representation of the interacting entities to map their
characteristics within the simulated or augmented space. Keeping these
representations accurate and up-to-date is crucial for seamless interaction and
system reliability. In this paper, we propose bidirectional age of incorrect
information (BAoII) to address this aspect. BAoII quantifies the time-dependent
penalty paid by an entity in a VDE due to incorrect or outdated knowledge about
itself and the overall dynamically changing space. This extends the concept of
age of incorrect information for a bidirectional information exchange,
capturing that a VDE requires mutual awareness of the entity's own
representation, measured in the virtual space, and what the other entities
share about their representations. Using a continuous-time Markov chain model,
we derive a closed-form expression for long-term BAoII and identify a
transmission cost threshold for optimal update strategies. We describe a
trade-off between communication cost and information freshness and validate our
model through numerical simulations, demonstrating the impact of BAoII on
evaluating system performance and highlighting its relevance for real-time
collaboration in the Metaverse and DTs.

*Tom Smeding,Mikołaj Konarski,Simon Peyton Jones,Andrew Fitzgibbon*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种支持多维数组的双数反向模式自动微分方法，通过向量化代码转换和符号解释实现高效性能，但牺牲了高阶代码支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准双数构造在反向模式自动微分中性能不足，尤其是在数组程序上。本文旨在解决这一问题，同时保持双数方法的简洁性。

Method: 结合向量化代码转换（BOT）、双数反向AD算法的数组语言扩展，以及符号解释，形成端到端编译流程。

Result: 实现了高效的多维数组支持，性能开销极低，但失去了对高阶代码的通用支持。

Conclusion: 该方法在数组程序上显著提升了反向AD性能，但需权衡高阶代码支持的限制。

Abstract: The standard dual-numbers construction works well for forward-mode automatic
differentiation (AD) and is attractive due to its simplicity; recently, it also
has been adapted to reverse-mode AD, but practical performance, especially on
array programs, leaves a lot to be desired. In this paper we introduce
first-class support for multidimensional arrays in dual-numbers reverse-mode AD
with little to no performance overhead. The algorithm consists of three
loosely-coupled components: a semantics-preserving vectorisation code
transformation (the bulk-operation transform or BOT), a fairly straightforward
lifting of the basic dual-numbers reverse AD algorithm to a mostly first-order
array language, and symbolic interpretation to achieve an end-to-end
compilation pipeline. Unfortunately, we lose some of the nice generalisable
aspects of dual-numbers AD in the process, most importantly support for
higher-order code.
  We do support some higher-order array combinators, but only a
carefully-chosen set: 'build' (elementwise array construction), 'gather' and
'scatter'. In return, the BOT can eliminate the essential (for AD)
higher-orderness of the input program, meaning that AD gets essentially
presented with a first-order program. This allows the naive trick of lifting
dual numbers to "dual arrays" to work without much modification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为现代正则表达式语言提供一种可靠且实用的语义描述，填补现有规范与形式化工作之间的空白。

Method: 通过机械化证明与ECMAScript规范的等价性，并展示两个实际应用：上下文等价性验证和PikeVM算法的形式化证明。

Result: 成功定义了一种完整且忠实于规范的正则表达式语义，并实现了两个实际应用。

Conclusion: 本文的机械化语义为现代正则表达式的理论和实践提供了重要工具，特别是在回溯语义和算法验证方面。

Abstract: We present the first mechanized, succinct, practical, complete, and
proven-faithful semantics for a modern regular expression language with
backtracking semantics. We ensure its faithfulness by proving it equivalent to
a preexisting line-by-line embedding of the official ECMAScript specification
of JavaScript regular expressions. We demonstrate its practicality by
presenting two real-world applications. First, a new notion of contextual
equivalence for modern regular expressions, which we use to prove or disprove
rewrites drawn from previous work. Second, the first formal proof of the PikeVM
algorithm used in many real-world engines. In contrast with the specification
and other formalization work, our semantics captures not only the top-priority
match, but a full backtracking tree recording all possible matches and their
respective priority. All our definitions and results have been mechanized in
the Rocq proof assistant.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，通过引入形式化查询语言和验证机制，为LLM生成的代码提供正确性保证，提升AI代码助手的用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码常存在错误且用户难以检测，限制了其在编程辅助中的应用。

Method: 结合形式化查询语言和符号解释器验证LLM生成的代码是否符合用户意图。

Result: 在21个代码生成任务中，验证器能正确验证83%的正确代码，并识别92%的错误代码。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM生成代码的可靠性，为自然语言编程提供了可能。

Abstract: In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by
taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However,
LLMs often generate incorrect code that users need to fix and the literature
suggests users often struggle to detect these errors. In this work we seek to
offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees
could improve the experience of using AI Code Assistants and potentially enable
natural language programming for users with little or no programming knowledge.
To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a formal query language
that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural
language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. Then, using
such a query we propose to verify LLM generated code to ensure it matches the
user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the
Ansible programming language which includes such a formal query language, a
calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic
interpreter which is used for the verification. On a benchmark suite of 21
code-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of
cases and identify incorrect code in 92%.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow increasingly sophisticated and
pervasive, their application to various Artificial Intelligence for IT
Operations (AIOps) tasks has garnered significant attention. However, a
comprehensive understanding of the impact, potential, and limitations of LLMs
in AIOps remains in its infancy. To address this gap, we conducted a detailed
survey of LLM4AIOps, focusing on how LLMs can optimize processes and improve
outcomes in this domain. We analyzed 183 research papers published between
January 2020 and December 2024 to answer four key research questions (RQs). In
RQ1, we examine the diverse failure data sources utilized, including advanced
LLM-based processing techniques for legacy data and the incorporation of new
data sources enabled by LLMs. RQ2 explores the evolution of AIOps tasks,
highlighting the emergence of novel tasks and the publication trends across
these tasks. RQ3 investigates the various LLM-based methods applied to address
AIOps challenges. Finally, RQ4 reviews evaluation methodologies tailored to
assess LLM-integrated AIOps approaches. Based on our findings, we discuss the
state-of-the-art advancements and trends, identify gaps in existing research,
and propose promising directions for future exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算平台多样化的QSDKs导致互操作性和跨平台开发困难，传统基于规则的转译方法效率低且维护成本高。

Method: 利用LLMs的预训练知识和上下文推理能力，实现编程语言无关的量子程序转译，保持功能等效性。

Result: 提出了一种无需手动定义转换规则的可扩展解决方案，提升了量子软件的可移植性。

Conclusion: LLMs为量子计算生态中的智能通用转译提供了新方向。

Abstract: There exist various Software Development Kits (SDKs) tailored to different
quantum computing platforms. These are known as Quantum SDKs (QSDKs). Examples
include but are not limited to Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane. However, this
diversity presents significant challenges for interoperability and
cross-platform development of hybrid quantum-classical software systems.
Traditional rule-based transpilers for translating code between QSDKs are
time-consuming to design and maintain, requiring deep expertise and rigid
mappings in the source and destination code. In this study, we explore the use
of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a flexible and automated solution.
Leveraging their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities, we
position LLMs as programming language-agnostic transpilers capable of
converting quantum programs from one QSDK to another while preserving
functional equivalence. Our approach eliminates the need for manually defined
transformation rules and offers a scalable solution to quantum software
portability. This work represents a step toward enabling intelligent,
general-purpose transpilation in the quantum computing ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成和软件自动化中受限于有限的推理上下文和缺乏显式代码结构推理能力。

Method: Kodezi Chronos采用多级嵌入内存引擎，结合向量和图索引，实现高效代码检索和推理。

Result: 在真实世界错误检测中表现优于现有模型，提升23%，调试周期减少40%。

Conclusion: Kodezi Chronos为自持续优化的软件生态系统提供了关键进展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software
automation, but are fundamentally constrained by limited inference-time context
and lack of explicit code structure reasoning. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a
next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and
maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire
codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits.
Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining
vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This
enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code,
supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and
real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random
Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain.
Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to
resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts,
simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and
semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models,
demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing
debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based
approaches. By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos
enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability
and productivity while reducing manual effort. These results mark a critical
advance toward self-sustaining, continuously optimized software ecosystems.

Conclusion: 该综述为研究者和从业者提供了当前领域的导航，并推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for sequential
decision-making and has attracted growing interest across various domains,
particularly following the advent of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in 2015.
Simultaneously, the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
further fueled interest in integrating RL with LLMs to enable more adaptive and
intelligent systems. In the field of software engineering (SE), the increasing
complexity of systems and the rising demand for automation have motivated
researchers to apply RL to a broad range of tasks, from software design and
development to quality assurance and maintenance. Despite growing research in
RL-for-SE, there remains a lack of a comprehensive and systematic survey of
this evolving field. To address this gap, we reviewed 115 peer-reviewed studies
published across 22 premier SE venues since the introduction of DRL. We
conducted a comprehensive analysis of publication trends, categorized SE topics
and RL algorithms, and examined key factors such as dataset usage, model design
and optimization, and evaluation practices. Furthermore, we identified open
challenges and proposed future research directions to guide and inspire ongoing
work in this evolving area. To summarize, this survey offers the first
systematic mapping of RL applications in software engineering, aiming to
support both researchers and practitioners in navigating the current landscape
and advancing the field. Our artifacts are publicly available:

Motivation: 解决现有检索增强方法中检索与生成分离导致的噪声传播问题，提高代码注释生成的效率和效果。

Result: 在Java、Python、C三种语言的基准测试中，RAGSum在BLEU、METEOR和ROUTE-L指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 紧密耦合检索与生成可提升注释自动化水平，未来需进一步验证和开发者研究。

Abstract: Automatically generating concise, informative comments for source code can
lighten documentation effort and accelerate program comprehension.
Retrieval-augmented approaches first fetch code snippets with existing comments
and then synthesize a new comment, yet retrieval and generation are typically
optimized in isolation, allowing irrelevant neighbors topropagate noise
downstream. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel approach named RAGSum with
the aim of both effectiveness and efficiency in recommendations. RAGSum is
built on top offuse retrieval and generation using a single CodeT5 backbone. We
report preliminary results on a unified retrieval-generation framework built on
CodeT5. A contrastive pre-training phase shapes code embeddings for
nearest-neighbor search; these weights then seed end-to-end training with a
composite loss that (i) rewards accurate top-k retrieval; and (ii) minimizes
comment-generation error. More importantly, a lightweight self-refinement loop
is deployed to polish the final output. We evaluated theframework on three
cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), and compared it with three
well-established baselines. The results show that our approach substantially
outperforms thebaselines with respect to BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L. These
findings indicate that tightly coupling retrieval and generationcan raise the
ceiling for comment automation and motivateforthcoming replications and
qualitative developer studies.

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的模型能有效弥合异味检测与修复之间的差距，为未来重构推荐系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Architectural smells such as God Class, Cyclic Dependency, and Hub-like
Dependency degrade software quality and maintainability. Existing tools detect
such smells but rarely suggest how to fix them. This paper explores the use of
pre-trained transformer models--CodeBERT and CodeT5--for recommending suitable
refactorings based on detected smells. We frame the task as a three-class
classification problem and fine-tune both models on over 2 million refactoring
instances mined from 11,149 open-source Java projects. CodeT5 achieves 96.9%
accuracy and 95.2% F1, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional baselines. Our
results show that transformer-based models can effectively bridge the gap
between smell detection and actionable repair, laying the foundation for future
refactoring recommendation systems. We release all code, models, and data under
an open license to support reproducibility and further research.

on the original HumanEval they score 65.90\% and 63.00\%. GRPO excels on basic

Conclusion: 该方法填补了智能电网领域新模型设计过程中评估方法的空白，并提供了实践经验总结。

Abstract: The ongoing digitalisation of the smart grid is resulting in an increase in
automated information exchanges across distributed energy systems. This process
has led to the development of new information and data models when the existing
ones fall short. To prevent potential disruptions caused by flaws in the newly
designed information and data models, it is essential to evaluate them during
the design process before they are implemented in operation.
  Currently, general explicit evaluation approaches outside the smart grid
domain stay at a high level without defining clear steps. Meanwhile, implicit
evaluation approaches in the smart grid domain focus on testing systems that
utilise information and data models already in use for functionality in terms
of conformance and interoperability. Notably, no combination of explicit and
implicit evaluation approaches for newly designed information and data models
offers a clearly defined set of steps during their design process in the smart
grid context.
  Consequently, we design a three-phase evaluation approach using design
science research to address this gap. Our evaluation approach combines explicit
and implicit evaluation methods and is applicable when developing new
information and data models. We use the development of an information model and
data model focused on industrial flexibility descriptions to refine our
evaluation approach. Additionally, we provide lessons learned from our
experience.

*João Granja-Correia,Remedios Hernández-Linares,Luca Ferranti,Arménio Rego*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合模糊逻辑的新方法，用于更准确地评估项目成功。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Likert量表方法忽视了项目成功的多面性和情境依赖性，需要更动态的评估方式。

Method: 采用分层Type-1 Mamdani模糊系统，优先考虑对终端用户的持续积极影响。

Result: 该方法可能更准确地衡量项目成功，并适用于复杂评估。

Conclusion: 未来研究将聚焦于模糊逻辑在社会科学中的实证测试和广泛应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to project success evaluation by
integrating fuzzy logic into an existing construct. Traditional Likert-scale
measures often overlook the context-dependent and multifaceted nature of
project success. The proposed hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system
prioritizes sustained positive impact for end-users, reducing emphasis on
secondary outcomes like stakeholder satisfaction and internal project success.
This dynamic approach may provide a more accurate measure of project success
and could be adaptable to complex evaluations. Future research will focus on
empirical testing and broader applications of fuzzy logic in social science.

*Salvador D. Escobedo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SCM的新方法，通过单一对话结构利用大语言模型进行软件开发，强调结构化对话和开发者的主动角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对生成式AI的依赖过于被动，SCM旨在纠正这一问题，重新确立开发者作为架构师和监督者的角色。

Method: SCM基于认知清晰性、可追溯性、模块化和文档化原则，通过单一长对话覆盖项目从需求到实现的全过程。

Result: SCM提供了一种结构化且持久的开发对话方式，优于当前的临时性交互。

Conclusion: SCM为开发者提供了一种更主动、更可控的利用大语言模型的方法，是对当前实践的改进。

Abstract: We propose the Single Conversation Methodology (SCM), a novel and pragmatic
approach to software development using large language models (LLMs). In
contrast to ad hoc interactions with generative AI, SCM emphasizes a structured
and persistent development dialogue, where all stages of a project - from
requirements to architecture and implementation - unfold within a single,
long-context conversation. The methodology is grounded on principles of
cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation. We define its
phases, best practices, and philosophical stance, while arguing that SCM offers
a necessary correction to the passive reliance on LLMs prevalent in current
practices. We aim to reassert the active role of the developer as architect and
supervisor of the intelligent tool.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了小型语言模型（SLMs）在自动检测测试异味（test smells）中的潜力，评估了Gemma3、Llama3.2和Phi-4在真实测试案例中的表现，Phi-4表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动测试中的测试异味（如模糊性、冗余等）降低了测试的可靠性和可维护性，现有检测工具缺乏可扩展性。

Method: 评估了三种SLMs（Gemma3、Llama3.2和Phi-4）在143个真实Ubuntu测试案例中检测七种测试异味的能力。

Result: Phi-4表现最佳，检测准确率达97%，Gemma3和Llama3.2约为91%。SLMs还能自主解释问题并提出改进建议。

Conclusion: SLMs是高效的工具，无需依赖大量规则定义即可提升测试质量，具有数据隐私保护潜力。

Abstract: Manual testing, in which testers follow natural language instructions to
validate system behavior, remains crucial for uncovering issues not easily
captured by automation. However, these test cases often suffer from test
smells, quality issues such as ambiguity, redundancy, or missing checks that
reduce test reliability and maintainability. While detection tools exist, they
typically require manual rule definition and lack scalability. This study
investigates the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) for automatically
detecting test smells. We evaluate Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Phi-4 on 143
real-world Ubuntu test cases, covering seven types of test smells. Phi-4
achieved the best results, reaching a pass@2 of 97% in detecting sentences with
test smells, while Gemma3 and Llama3.2 reached approximately 91%. Beyond
detection, SLMs autonomously explained issues and suggested improvements, even
without explicit prompt instructions. They enabled low-cost, concept-driven
identification of diverse test smells without relying on extensive rule
definitions or syntactic analysis. These findings highlight the potential of
SLMs as efficient tools that preserve data privacy and can improve test quality
in real-world scenarios.

*Dongming Jin,Weisong Sun,Jiangping Huang,Peng Liang,Jifeng Xuan,Yang Liu,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: iReDev是一个知识驱动的多智能体框架，用于智能需求开发，通过整合人类知识和多智能体协作，显著提升需求开发的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需求开发是软件工程中的关键阶段，但现有研究对多智能体系统的支持有限，且忽视了人类知识与智能体的结合以及人机协作。

Method: iReDev框架包含六个知识驱动的智能体，通过事件驱动的通信机制和人工池实现协作，同时引入人机协作机制。

Result: 实验表明，iReDev在多个方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: iReDev为智能需求开发提供了新方向，并展望了三个关键发展方向。

Abstract: Requirements development is a critical phase as it is responsible for
providing a clear understanding of what stakeholders need. It involves
collaboration among stakeholders to extract explicit requirements and address
potential conflicts, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently,
multi-agent systems for software development have attracted much attention.
However, existing research provides limited support for requirements
development and overlooks the injection of human knowledge into agents and the
human-agent collaboration. % To address these issues, this paper proposes a
knowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirement development,
named iReDev. iReDev features: iReDev consists of six knowledge-driven agents
to support the entire requirements development. They collaboratively perform
various tasks to produce a software requirements specification. iReDev focuses
on integrating human knowledge for agents, enabling them to simulate real-world
stakeholders. iReDev uses an event-driven communication mechanism based on an
artifact pool. Agents continuously monitor the pool and autonomously trigger
the next action based on its changes, enabling iReDev to handle new
requirements quickly. iReDev introduces a human-in-the-loop mechanism to
support human-agent collaboration, ensuring that the generated artifacts align
with the expectations of stakeholders. We evaluated the generated artifacts and
results show that iReDev outperforms existing baselines in multiple aspects. We
further envision three key directions and hope this work can facilitate the
development of intelligent requirements development.

Motivation: 预训练模型的广泛集成挑战了传统需求工程的基本假设，如功能可分解性和行为可预测性，需要重新思考现有方法。

Method: 提出一个针对预训练模型驱动软件系统的需求工程概念框架，并概述相关研究方向。

Result: 框架为研究人员和实践者提供了应对预训练模型系统需求工程挑战的指导。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁重新思考需求工程方法，以适应预训练模型带来的新特性，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large pretrained models have led to their widespread
integration as core components in modern software systems. The trend is
expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Unlike traditional software
systems governed by deterministic logic, systems powered by pretrained models
exhibit distinctive and emergent characteristics, such as ambiguous capability
boundaries, context-dependent behavior, and continuous evolution. These
properties fundamentally challenge long-standing assumptions in requirements
engineering, including functional decomposability and behavioral
predictability. This paper investigates this problem and advocates for a
rethinking of existing requirements engineering methodologies. We propose a
conceptual framework tailored to requirements engineering of
pretrained-model-enabled software systems and outline several promising
research directions within this framework. This vision helps provide a guide
for researchers and practitioners to tackle the emerging challenges in
requirements engineering of pretrained-model-enabled systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语法挖掘技术主要关注语法结构恢复，而输入处理的语义方面仍未被充分探索。

Method: 通过动态分析递归下降解析器的实现，将程序运行时行为映射到文法，提取并嵌入语义动作到文法规则中。

Result: 实验证明该方法能准确通过生成的属性文法重现程序行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为输入处理的语义恢复提供了可行途径，实现了全面的规范恢复。

Abstract: Software systems that process structured inputs often lack complete and
up-to-date specifications, which specify the input syntax and the semantics of
input processing. While grammar mining techniques have focused on recovering
syntactic structures, the semantics of input processing remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for inferring
attributed grammars from parser implementations. Given an input grammar, our
technique dynamically analyzes the implementation of recursive descent parsers
to reconstruct the semantic aspects of input handling, resulting in
specifications in the form of attributed grammars. By observing program
executions and mapping the program's runtime behavior to the grammar, we
systematically extract and embed semantic actions into the grammar rules. This
enables comprehensive specification recovery. We demonstrate the feasibility of
our approach using an initial set of programs, showing that it can accurately
reproduce program behavior through the generated attributed grammars.

TL;DR: 论文提出CodeGPTSensor+，通过对抗训练增强对修改后LLM生成代码的检测鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM生成代码的广泛应用，检测其合规性和质量成为关键问题，但现有方法对修改后的代码鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出CodeGPTSensor+，集成MIST模块生成对抗样本，通过对抗训练提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在HMCorp数据集上，CodeGPTSensor+显著提升对抗测试集检测准确率，同时保持原测试集高准确率。

Conclusion: CodeGPTSensor+在检测修改后LLM生成代码方面表现出优越鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their powerful
code-generation capabilities have been widely applied in tasks like code
completion and automated development, demonstrating the value of improving
coding efficiency. However, the extensive use of LLM-generated code also raises
several new challenges. On the one hand, issues such as the regulation of code
provenance, copyright disputes, and code quality have become increasingly
concerning. How to effectively detect LLM-generated code and ensure its
compliant and responsible use has become a critical and urgent issue. On the
other hand, in practical applications, LLM-generated code is often subject to
manual modifications, such as variable renaming or structural adjustments.
Although some recent studies have proposed training-based and zero-shot methods
for detecting LLM-generated code, these approaches show insufficient robustness
when facing modified LLM-generated code, and there is a lack of an effective
solution. To address the real-world scenario where LLM-generated code may
undergo minor modifications, we propose CodeGPTSensor+, an enhanced version of
CodeGPTSensor, which employs adversarial training to improve robustness against
input perturbations. CodeGPTSensor+ integrates an adversarial sample generation
module, Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST), which
systematically generates both high-quality and representative adversarial
samples. This module effectively enhances the model's resistance against
diverse adversarial attacks. Experimental results on the HMCorp dataset
demonstrate that CodeGPTSensor+ significantly improves detection accuracy on
the adversarial test set while maintaining high accuracy on the original test
set, showcasing superior robustness compared to CodeGPTSensor.

Motivation: 研究子流形上积分泛函的估计问题，因其在多种计量经济学场景中自然出现。

Method: 采用半参数插件估计器，分析其收敛速率，并推导渐近正态性定理和方差估计。

Result: 估计器达到极小极大最优收敛速率$n^{-\frac{s}{2s+d-m}}$，且渐近正态性成立。

Conclusion: 积分操作有效降低了问题维度，理论与模拟结果一致。

Abstract: This paper studies the semiparametric estimation and inference of integral
functionals on submanifolds, which arise naturally in a variety of econometric
settings. For linear integral functionals on a regular submanifold, we show
that the semiparametric plug-in estimator attains the minimax-optimal
convergence rate $n^{-\frac{s}{2s+d-m}}$, where $s$ is the H\"{o}lder
smoothness order of the underlying nonparametric function, $d$ is the dimension
of the first-stage nonparametric estimation, $m$ is the dimension of the
submanifold over which the integral is taken. This rate coincides with the
standard minimax-optimal rate for a $(d-m)$-dimensional nonparametric
estimation problem, illustrating that integration over the $m$-dimensional
manifold effectively reduces the problem's dimensionality. We then provide a
general asymptotic normality theorem for linear/nonlinear submanifold
integrals, along with a consistent variance estimator. We provide simulation
evidence in support of our theoretical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典DiD在非可加性处理效应下可能高估效果，需要一种更灵活的评估工具。

Method: 提出NA-DiD框架，基于Choquet积分进行效应聚合，推导估计公式并分析理论性质。

Result: 模拟医院卫生干预实验显示，NA-DiD比经典DiD更准确，避免了高估问题。

Conclusion: NA-DiD为处理非可加性效应提供了更精确的工具，适用于复杂干预评估。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Non-Additive Difference-in-Differences (NA-DiD)
framework, which extends classical DiD by incorporating non-additive measures
the Choquet integral for effect aggregation. It serves as a novel econometric
tool for impact evaluation, particularly in settings with non-additive
treatment effects. First, we introduce the integral representation of the
classial DiD model, and then extend it to non-additive measures, therefore
deriving the formulae for NA-DiD estimation. Then, we give its theoretical
properties. Applying NA-DiD to a simulated hospital hygiene intervention, we
find that classical DiD can overestimate treatment effects, f.e. failing to
account for compliance erosion. In contrast, NA-DiD provides a more accurate
estimate by incorporating non-linear aggregation. The Julia implementation of
the techniques used and introduced in this article is provided in the
appendices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RDD模型依赖于潜在结果在断点处的连续性假设，但在社会项目或政府福利等场景中，运行变量可能被策略性操纵，导致假设失效。本文旨在识别并解决这一问题。

Method: 通过利用安慰剂处理和安慰剂结果，引入局部工具变量估计器，分解为标准RDD估计器和新调整项。

Result: 证明了估计器的一致性，并验证了稳健的偏差校正推断程序。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了RDD在存在策略性行为场景中的应用，适用于社会科学中的常见问题。

Abstract: Standard regression discontinuity design (RDD) models rely on the continuity
of expected potential outcomes at the cutoff. The standard continuity
assumption can be violated by strategic manipulation of the running variable,
which is realistic when the cutoff is widely known and when the treatment of
interest is a social program or government benefit. In this work, we identify
the treatment effect despite such a violation, by leveraging a placebo
treatment and a placebo outcome. We introduce a local instrumental variable
estimator. Our estimator decomposes into two terms: the standard RDD estimator
of the target outcome's discontinuity, and a new adjustment term based on the
placebo outcome's discontinuity. We show that our estimator is consistent, and
we justify a robust bias-corrected inference procedure. Our method expands the
applicability of RDD to settings with strategic behavior around the cutoff,
which commonly arise in social science.

TL;DR: 研究发现，美国银行发放的企业贷款中，超过三分之一由独立于借款企业的法律实体提供全额担保。第三方信用担保与贷款风险、利率和违约率呈负相关，缓解了信贷市场的抵押约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨第三方信用担保对企业贷款的影响，特别是对抵押约束的缓解作用。

Method: 利用美联储的综合数据集，采用控制企业和贷款方时间变化效应的实证策略。

Result: 第三方信用担保降低了贷款风险、利率和违约率，尤其是资产价值受负面冲击的小企业更倾向于使用信用担保而非抵押。

Conclusion: 第三方信用担保在信贷市场中发挥了积极作用，尤其是对抵押受限的小企业提供了替代融资方案。

Abstract: Using a comprehensive dataset collected by the Federal Reserve, I find that
over one-third of corporate loans issued by US banks are fully guaranteed by
legal entities separate from borrowing firms. Using an empirical strategy that
accounts for time-varying firm and lender effects, I find that the existence of
a third-party credit guarantee is negatively related to loan risk, loan rate,
and loan delinquency. Third party credit guarantees alleviate the effect of
collateral constraints in credit market. Firms (particularly smaller firms)
that experience a negative shock to their asset values are less likely to use
collateral and more likely to use credit guarantees in new borrowings.

Motivation: 加拿大银行业无政府救助历史，且自1920年代以来存在隐性政府担保，为研究市场纪律和改革前景提供了独特背景。

Method: 使用综合数据集和多种方法，分析银行特定和市场风险因素。

Result: 大型银行在存款和次级债务上分别享有80和70个基点的融资优势；市场纪律仅存在于次级债务。

Conclusion: 大型银行具有显著融资优势，市场纪律对次级债务有效，但对高级债务无效。

Abstract: We employ a comprehensive data set and a variety of methods to provide
evidence on the magnitude of large banks' funding advantage in Canada in
addition to the extent to which market discipline exists across different
securities issued by the Canadian banks. The banking sector in Canada provides
a unique setting in which to examine market discipline along with the prospects
of proposed reforms because Canada has no history of government bailouts, and
an implicit government guarantee has been in effect consistently since the
1920s. We find that large banks have a funding advantage over small banks after
controlling for bank-specific and market risk factors. Large banks on average
pay 80 basis points and 70 basis points less, respectively, on their deposits
and subordinated debt. Working with hand-collected market data on debt issues
by large banks, we also find that market discipline exists for subordinated
debt and not for senior debt.

Motivation: 研究企业间贸易中的议价行为及其对价格的影响，特别是在双边市场力量存在的情况下。

Method: 构建理论框架，分析市场结构，并通过美国进口数据估计议价能力和传递弹性。

Result: 发现进口商具有较强的议价能力，2018年关税的传递不完全，主要由于出口商成本下降。

Conclusion: 议价和网络刚性影响价格结果，对全球价值链中的加价分散和冲击传播有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper develops a theory of bargaining in firm-to-firm trade with
two-sided market power. The framework accommodates flexible market structures,
yielding analytical expressions for pair-specific markups and pass-through
elasticities. In U.S. import data, we estimate strong importer bargaining power
and an upward-sloping export supply curve, consistent with oligopsony power.
Pass-through of the 2018 tariffs in firm-to-firm relationships is incomplete,
in contrast to product-level studies, primarily due to exporter cost reductions
driven by falling demand from dominant buyers. Our study highlights how
bargaining and network rigidities shape price outcomes, with implications for
markup dispersion and shock propagation in global value chains.

Motivation: 探讨政府是否通过调整预算政策来应对公共债务上升，避免财政不可持续性问题。

Method: 使用52个工业国家和新兴经济体自1990年以来的预算数据，采用面板方法分析，考虑横截面依赖性和异质性财政行为。

Result: 债务占GDP比例每上升10个百分点，长期基本盈余占GDP比例平均上升0.5个百分点，调整行为在不同债务水平和经济体中均显著。

Conclusion: 多数政府采取李嘉图政策设计，避免庞氏融资，确保财政可持续性。

Abstract: Do governments adjust budgetary policy to rising public debt, precluding
fiscal unsustainability? Using budget data for 52 industrial and emerging
economies since 1990, we apply panel methods accounting for cross-sectional
dependence and heterogeneous fiscal conduct. We find that a primary-balance
rule with tax-smoothing motives and responsiveness to debt has robust
explanatory power in describing fiscal behavior. Controlling for temporary
output, temporary spending, and the current account balance, a
10-percentage-point increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio raises the long-run
primary surplus-to-GDP ratio by 0.5 percentage points on average. Corrective
adjustments hold across high- and low-debt countries and across industrial and
emerging economies. Our results imply many governments pursue Ricardian policy
designs, avoiding Ponzi-type financing.

Motivation: 探讨贿赂对企业生产、进入和技术选择的影响，挑战贿赂普遍有害的传统观点。

Method: 基于148个国家的数据，分析贿赂对资本密集型和劳动密集型企业的异质性影响，并构建一般均衡模型。

Result: 在贫穷国家，仅消除资本密集型企业的贿赂可使资本存量增加18.7%，总产出增加3.4%；在富裕国家，效果更显著。

Conclusion: 贿赂的影响因企业技术类型而异，部分消除贿赂可能比完全消除更有效，挑战了贿赂普遍有害的观点。

Abstract: We study the production, entry, and technological decisions of firms in the
presence of bribery. We find that bribery can be justified even in the absence
of bureaucratic inefficiencies. We document substantial technology-specific
heterogeneity in bribery in 148 countries and incorporate it into a general
equilibrium model, where firms use capital-intensive or labor-intensive
technology. When bribery more heavily affects less efficient labor-intensive
firms, resources move toward more efficient capital-intensive firms, resulting
in higher capital accumulation and aggregate output. In poorer countries, the
elimination of bribery only for capital-intensive firms increases the capital
stock by 18.7% more and the aggregate output by 3.4% more than the complete
elimination of bribery. In wealthier countries, the elimination of bribery only
for capital-intensive firms increases the capital stock by 44.4% more and the
aggregate output by 15.4% more than the complete elimination of bribery. Our
findings challenge the established view of bribery as uniformly harmful.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖数学假设，可能不符合人类实际认知。本文探索了一种更贴近人类有限认知精度的替代方案。

Method: 采用粗粒度加法，将数值分组为感知类别，并用代表元素替换后相加，实现惯性稳定化。

Result: 圣彼得堡级数在粗粒度加法下可实现惯性稳定化，为有限认知代理提供了一种处理发散奖励结构的可行方式。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅为圣彼得堡悖论提供了新的视角，还在行为建模和机器推理领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: The St. Petersburg paradox presents a longstanding challenge in decision
theory. It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no
rational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce
auxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal
discounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve
mathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually
perceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative
approach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse
partitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are
grouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a
representative element of its group before being added. This method allows for
a phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a
behavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as
a definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a
plausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might
handle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg
series can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed
partition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral
modeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.

Result: 列空间顺序表征所有道德风险问题中的可行性比较；锥生成顺序表征风险中性代理人和有限责任下的成本比较；zonotope顺序表征任何风险厌恶代理人的成本比较。

Conclusion: 几何方法为道德风险问题中的信息比较提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: I use a novel geometric approach to compare information in moral hazard
problems. I study three nested geometric orders on information, namely the
column space, the conic span, and the zonotope orders. The orders are defined
by the inclusion of the column space, the conic span, and the zonotope of the
matrices representing the experiments. For each order, I establish four
equivalent characterizations, (i) inclusion of polyhedral sets of feasible
state dependent utilities, (ii) matrix factorization, (iii) posterior belief
distributions, and (iv) classes of moral hazard problems. The column space
order characterizes the comparison of feasibility in all moral hazard problems.
The conic span order characterizes the comparison of costs in all moral hazard
problems with a risk neutral agent and limited liability. The zonotope order
characterizes the comparison of costs in all moral hazard problems when the
agent can have any utility exhibiting risk aversion.

### [184] [Rational Bubbles on Dividend-Paying Assets: A Comment on Tirole (1985)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12477)
*Ngoc-Sang Pham,Alexis Akira Toda*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: Tirole (1985)认为资产泡沫可以解决资本过度积累问题，但本文通过反例证明其命题1(c)不完全成立，需额外假设初始资本足够大且股息足够小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Tirole (1985)关于资产泡沫必要性的命题1(c)是否普遍成立。

Method: 通过构建分析性反例，并在特定条件下（初始资本大、股息小）验证命题。

Result: 命题1(c)在一般情况下不成立，但在特定条件下成立。

Conclusion: Tirole的命题需附加条件才能成立，说明其结论的局限性。

Abstract: Tirole (1985) studied an overlapping generations model with capital
accumulation and showed that the emergence of asset bubbles solves the capital
over-accumulation problem. His Proposition 1(c) claims that if the dividend
growth rate is above the bubbleless interest rate (the steady-state interest
rate in the Diamond economy without bubbles) but below the population growth
rate, then bubbles are necessary in the sense that there exists no bubbleless
equilibrium but there exists a unique bubbly equilibrium. We provide a
counterexample to this claim based on an analytical example but prove the claim
under the additional assumptions that initial capital is sufficiently large and
dividends are sufficiently small.

### [185] [Monopoly Pricing with a Public Option](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12779)
*Teddy Mekonnen*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 垄断者通过限制供应加剧公共选项的拥堵，从而提高消费者对垄断服务的支付意愿。扩大公共选项容量会降低生产者福利，甚至可能损害消费者福利。引入垄断者到仅由公共选项服务的市场中则明确改善消费者福利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在公共选项存在的情况下，垄断者如何通过策略性行为影响市场和消费者福利，为混合公共-私人市场（如住房、教育和医疗）提供启示。

Method: 分析垄断者在面对免费但容量受限的公共选项时的策略行为，包括限制供应以加剧公共选项的拥堵，从而影响消费者支付意愿。

Result: 扩大公共选项容量会降低生产者福利，并可能损害消费者福利；而引入垄断者到仅由公共选项服务的市场中则明确改善消费者福利。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了混合市场中垄断者和公共选项的相互作用，对政策制定者在设计公共-私人混合市场时具有重要参考价值。

Abstract: This paper examines how a profit-maximizing monopolist competes against a
free but capacity-constrained public option. The monopolist strategically
restricts its supply beyond standard monopoly levels, thereby intensifying
congestion at the public option and increasing consumers' willingness-to-pay
for guaranteed access. Expanding the capacity of the public option always
reduces producer welfare and, counterintuitively, may also reduce consumer
welfare. In contrast, introducing a monopolist to a market served only by a
capacity-constrained public option unambiguously improves consumer welfare.
These findings have implications for mixed public-private markets, such as
housing, education, and healthcare.

TL;DR: 研究动态垄断模型，买家可自由处置差异化商品，扩展科斯谈判框架，证明卖家在均衡中可实现从最低买家估值到近似最高承诺收益的任意收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展科斯谈判框架至商品数量或质量内生决定的情境，应用于数据市场。

Method: 利用序贯谈判与静态机制设计的联系。

Result: 当玩家耐心时，卖家可在均衡中实现从最低买家估值到近似最高承诺收益的任意收益。

Conclusion: 模型适用于数据市场，为数据经纪人销售营销列表提供理论支持。

Abstract: We study a model of dynamic monopoly with differentiated goods that buyers
can freely dispose of. The model extends the framework of Coasian bargaining to
situations in which the quantity or quality of the good is endogenously
determined. Our main result is that when players are patient, the seller can
sustain in equilibrium any payoff between the lowest possible buyer valuation
and (approximately) the highest payoff achievable with commitment power, thus
establishing a folk theorem. We apply our model to data markets, where data
brokers sell marketing lists to producers. Methodologically, we leverage the
connection between sequential bargaining and static mechanism design.

Motivation: 研究技术市场中企业间通过技术许可协议形成的协作网络，提出一种能够反映行业动态的权力指数。

Method: 定义基于图的权力指数，结合度中心性和重新调整的特征向量中心性，并通过市场系数调整。

Result: 指数对网络结构变化敏感，经济主体在跨部门技术溢出较小时表现稳定，但相关TU游戏的核心通常为空。

Conclusion: 通过公理化证明了指数的独立性，并扩展至交换网络，即使传播系数非正。

Abstract: We introduce and analyze a novel family of power indices tailored for sharing
networks in technological markets, where firms operate competitively within,
but not across, distinct industrial sectors. In these settings, inter-firm
collaboration structures emerge from formal technology licensing agreements.
The proposed indices are defined over graphs with a priori unions and combine
two key centrality measures - degree-based and rescaled eigenvector centrality
- modulated by positive market coefficients that reflect sectoral dynamics. We
first explore the monotonicity properties of these indices, highlighting their
responsiveness to local changes in network structure. Interestingly, major
economic actors exhibit structural stability when inter-sectoral technological
spillovers are minimal. Building on these findings, we provide theoretical
underpinnings by characterizing the indices as the Shapley values of a family
of coherent and economically interpretable transferable utility (TU) games
defined over such graphs. However, for a broad class of network structures, the
core of these TU games is often empty, signaling inherent instability in
technological sharing arrangements. Finally, we offer an axiomatic foundation
for this family of indices, proving independence of the proposed axioms. This
axiomatization extends naturally to exchange networks, even when
stage-propagation coefficients are not positive.

Conclusion: 数据化能够加速技术进步对经济发展的积极影响，并通过中国数据开放政策的DID实验验证了这一理论解释。

Abstract: This paper constructs a clean and efficient representative agent model of the
data economy from a macroeconomics perspective, in order to analyze the impact
of datatization and technological progress on the dynamic general equilibrium
of 'consumption-capital', and the catalysis effect of datatization on
technological progress. We first set the data in production comes from
datatization of the total output of the society and is exponentially
functionally related to the technology. Secondly, the data production function
is used to solve the optimization problem for firms and households and to
construct a dynamic general equilibrium of 'consumption-capital' based on the
endogenous interest rate solved by maximizing the returns of firms. Finally, by
using numerical simulation and phase diagram analysis, we find that the effects
of increasing datatization and encouraging technological progress each exhibit
different nonlinear characteristics for equilibrium capital and equilibrium
consumption, we thus conclude that datatization enables the positive effects of
technological progress on economic development to be more rapid and persistent.
We select two types of Chinese policies regarding data openness to represent
the role of datatization, and demonstrate the catalysis role of datatization
for the development of the digital economy by setting up difference in
difference (DID) experiments, which provide persuasive evidence for the
theoretical interpretation of the paper.

### [1] [STELLA: Self-Evolving LLM Agent for Biomedical Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02004)
*Ruofan Jin,Zaixi Zhang,Mengdi Wang,Le Cong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STELLA是一种自进化的AI代理，通过动态工具库和模板库自主提升能力，在生物医学任务中表现优异且性能随经验提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学研究中数据碎片化和静态AI工具无法适应动态需求的问题。

Method: 采用多代理架构，包括动态工具库（Tool Ocean）和模板库（Template Library），通过工具创建代理自动发现和集成新工具。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中表现优异，性能随经验显著提升。

Conclusion: STELLA代表了AI代理系统的重大进步，能够动态扩展专业知识以加速生物医学发现。

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

### [2] [HCVR: A Hybrid Approach with Correlation-aware Voting Rules for Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02073)
*Nikita Bhedasgaonkar,Rushikesh K. Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCVR是一种轻量级基于规则的特征选择方法，结合P2P和P2T相关性，通过多数投票规则去除冗余特征并保留相关特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法在去除冗余特征和保留相关特征方面存在不足，HCVR旨在通过混合非迭代和迭代过滤方法提升性能。

Method: HCVR采用贪婪的后向消除策略，结合相关性阈值和多数投票规则，逐步消除多个特征。

Result: 在SPAMBASE数据集上，HCVR相比传统非迭代和迭代方法表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: HCVR通过混合策略和投票规则，有效提升了特征选择的效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying
filtering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文综述了提升大语言模型（LLM）推理计算效率的方法，重点介绍了固定计算预算（L1）和动态调整计算（L2）的两类策略，并探讨了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在推理时计算效率低下，无法根据任务复杂度动态调整计算资源，导致简单问题过度计算而复杂问题计算不足。

Method: 提出两级分类法：L1（固定计算预算）和L2（动态调整计算），并对主流LLM在多数据集上进行性能评估。

Result: 研究揭示了推理性能与计算资源消耗之间的权衡关系，并展示了TTC方法的实际控制性和适应性。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究混合思维模型等方向，以提升LLM的计算效率、鲁棒性和用户响应能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

TL;DR: SciGym是一个评估大型语言模型（LLM）在开放科学发现任务中实验设计和分析能力的基准测试，通过干实验室模拟生物系统，避免了湿实验室的高成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM的科学能力，尤其是实验设计和结果解释能力，这些在生物学等复杂系统研究中至关重要。

Method: 使用系统生物学标记语言（SBML）编码的生物系统模型进行干实验室模拟，生成模拟数据，评估六种前沿LLM在137个小系统和总计350个系统上的表现。

Result: 能力更强的模型表现更优，但随着系统复杂性增加，所有模型的性能显著下降，表明LLM在科学能力上仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: SciGym为评估LLM的科学能力提供了有效工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并指明了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

### [5] [What Neuroscience Can Teach AI About Learning in Continuously Changing Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02103)
*Daniel Durstewitz,Bruno Averbeck,Georgia Koppe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 探讨AI如何从神经科学中学习，以实现持续适应环境的能力，并推动NeuroAI领域的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI模型训练成本高且固定，而动物能持续适应环境变化，尤其是社交物种。研究如何将神经科学的快速适应机制应用于AI。

Method: 整合AI中的持续学习和上下文学习文献，与神经科学中行为任务的学习机制（如规则、奖励概率变化）进行对比分析。

Result: 提出神经科学可为AI提供快速适应环境的机制，同时AI的发展也可能反哺神经科学研究。

Conclusion: 神经科学与AI的交叉研究（NeuroAI）有望推动双方领域的发展，特别是在持续适应和快速学习方面。

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

### [6] [The Illusion of Fairness: Auditing Fairness Interventions with Audit Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02152)
*Disa Sariola,Patrick Button,Aron Culotta,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用审计研究数据改进自动化招聘算法的训练和评估，发现传统公平干预方法存在隐藏偏差，并提出基于个体治疗效果估计的新干预方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决AI系统（如招聘算法）中的偏见问题，传统方法因数据选择偏差和标签偏差而效果有限。

Method: 方法包括利用审计研究的高质量数据，分析传统公平干预方法的局限性，并提出基于个体治疗效果估计的新干预方法。

Result: 结果显示，传统方法看似公平，但实际存在约10%的偏差；新方法进一步减少了算法歧视。

Conclusion: 结论是审计研究数据能显著提升算法公平性评估和干预效果，新方法更具潜力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

*Berkan Dokmeci,Qingyang Wu,Ben Athiwaratkun,Ce Zhang,Shuaiwen Leon Song,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过数据多样化策略（如DTS方法）优化偏好学习，显著提升大语言模型在数学推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管偏好学习在人类反馈对齐方面取得进展，但数学推理仍是挑战，需探索数据多样化策略以提升模型能力。

Method: 评估温度采样、思维链提示和MCTS三种数据生成方法，并提出DTS方法，系统分解问题为多样化推理路径。

Result: DTS方法在GSM8K和MATH任务上分别提升7.1%和4.2%，计算开销仅增加1.03倍，优于MCTS的高成本低回报。

Conclusion: 结构化探索多样化问题解决方法比传统方法更有效，为数学对齐生成更优偏好数据。

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

*Amogh Mannekote,Adam Davies,Guohao Li,Kristy Elizabeth Boyer,ChengXiang Zhai,Bonnie J Dorr,Francesco Pinto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了LLM作为角色扮演代理时，其陈述的信念与实际行为之间的一致性，并提出了评估框架和一致性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM被广泛用于生成合成数据，确保其输出与角色一致成为关键问题。

Method: 通过增强版GenAgents角色库和信任游戏，引入信念-行为一致性度量，分析影响因素。

Result: 发现LLM的陈述信念与模拟行为存在系统性不一致，即使信念看似合理。

Conclusion: 需明确LLM信念与行为何时一致，以正确应用于行为研究。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索静态智能体如何通过不同机制（如噪声注入、学习算法和邻居收益知识）实现合作，并研究稀释和移动性对空间囚徒困境的影响。

Method: 使用独立多智能体Q学习算法，定义不同动作，并与经典非强化学习的空间囚徒困境结果对比。

Result: 观察到多种效应，包括固定更新规则与学习规则的定性等价性，以及多动作定义下种群间共生互利效应的出现。

Conclusion: 该算法在建模不同博弈场景中具有多样性和基准测试潜力，展示了强化学习在空间囚徒困境中的应用前景。

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

### [10] [Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and Rigorous Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02253)
*Jungkoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NL2FLOW是一个自动化系统，用于生成规划问题并评估LLM生成的计划质量，结果显示直接推理优于中间步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM规划和推理能力提升中的数据生成和评估瓶颈问题。

Method: 引入NL2FLOW系统，自动化生成规划问题（自然语言、结构化表示、PDDL）并评估计划质量。

Result: 最高性能模型生成有效计划的成功率为86%，最优计划为69%；直接推理优于中间步骤。

Conclusion: 动态理解LLM的局限性及系统化工具对释放其潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

### [11] [Iterated belief revision: from postulates to abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02319)
*Paolo Liberatore*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了信念修订领域的现状，指出现有研究多依赖语法特征（如公设）而缺乏对修订机制能力的全面分析。作者提出需要关注修订机制的能力（如塑性、平等化、教条化等），而非仅满足特定公设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前信念修订领域的研究过于依赖公设，忽略了修订机制的实际能力。作者希望通过分析不同修订机制的能力，填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析多种修订机制（如词典序、自然、激进等），证明它们各自具备的特定能力（如塑性、平等化、教条化等）。

Result: 不同修订机制具备不同的能力，例如某些机制能实现教条化状态，而另一些则能实现平等化状态。

Conclusion: 信念修订研究应关注修订机制的能力而非仅满足公设，以更好地适应实际应用需求。

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

*Bowen Chen,Zhao Wang,Shingo Takamatsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OMS框架解决了LLM在关键词决策中的三大限制，实现了无需训练数据、多目标优化和自反思的关键词生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法依赖大规模数据、缺乏多目标性能监控和优化，且关键词选择质量控制弱。

Method: 提出OMS框架，具备实时性（无需训练数据）、多目标优化和自反思能力。

Result: 实验证明OMS优于现有方法，消融和人工评估验证了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: OMS为自动化关键词决策提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance
reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq.
We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

Abstract: AI research agents are demonstrating great potential to accelerate scientific
progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine

MLE-bench, a challenging benchmark where agents compete in Kaggle competitions
to solve real-world machine learning problems. We formalize AI research agents

modifying them using operators. By designing and systematically varying
different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we
show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best
pairing of search strategy and operator set achieves a state-of-the-art result

Motivation: 现有医疗决策模拟框架多关注单轮任务，与现实诊断过程的动态、交互性不符，需要更贴近实际的模拟方法。

Method: 基于MIMIC-III EHR构建MIMIC-Patient数据集，提出DynamiCare框架，模拟多轮、交互式临床诊断过程。

Result: 实验验证了DynamiCare的可行性和有效性，建立了首个动态临床决策基准。

Conclusion: DynamiCare为LLM驱动的动态临床决策提供了新方向，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能在竞争环境中进行目标推理，并探索其战略行为。

Method: 通过进化IPD锦标赛，比较经典策略与前沿AI公司模型的对抗表现，并分析其决策理由。

Result: LLMs表现出高度竞争力，不同模型有独特策略：Gemini冷酷，OpenAI合作，Claude宽容。

Conclusion: LLMs能推理时间范围和对手策略，连接了经典博弈论与机器心理学。

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

<details>

Motivation: 传统检索增强生成（RAG）管道在复杂信息需求场景中表现不佳，现有方法因单一模型处理高层规划和详细执行而效率低下。

Method: HiRA将复杂任务分解为子任务，由领域特定代理处理，并通过结构化机制协调结果。

Result: 在四个复杂跨模态搜索基准测试中，HiRA显著优于现有RAG和基于代理的系统。

Conclusion: 分层规划和执行分离在多步信息搜索任务中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is
their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical
and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off
of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires
significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural
Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as
Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate
human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of
applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an
agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI
agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage
in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately
performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is
evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced
verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and
configurability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TH2T的两阶段微调策略，旨在通过提升LRMs对任务难度和冗余结构的认知，减少其过度思考现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LRMs在处理复杂推理任务时存在过度思考问题，研究发现其根源在于模型无法像人类一样预先识别任务属性（如难度），导致推理过程缺乏针对性。

Method: TH2T通过两阶段微调：1）难度催眠（difficulty-hypnosis）结合异构数据集增强模型对任务难度的敏感性；2）冗余催眠（redundancy-hypnosis）引导模型识别推理步骤中的冗余结构。

Result: 实验表明，TH2T在7B/14B/32B模型上显著降低了推理成本（简单任务减少70%，困难任务减少40%），同时保持性能稳定。

Conclusion: TH2T有效提升了LRMs的难度感知能力并减少了冗余推理，为优化模型推理效率提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

Motivation: 远程教育中学生脱离任务可能导致严重后果，如学业中断。研究旨在通过非强制性测验的参与度检测学生脱离行为，为及时干预提供依据。

Result: 实验结果显示平衡准确率为91%，85%的脱离学生被正确检测。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个高预测性能和可解释的框架，并讨论了如何设计及时干预以减少在线学习中的脱离行为。

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非精确抽象在MCTS中引入近似误差，导致无法收敛到最优动作。因此，需要一种安全的抽象丢弃方法以避免性能下降。

Method: 提出了两种抽象丢弃方案：OGA-IAAD（适用于时间关键场景）和OGA-CAD（旨在相同迭代次数下提升MCTS性能）。

Result: 新方案在性能提升的同时避免了显著的性能下降，优于Xu等人的方法。

Conclusion: OGA-IAAD和OGA-CAD是安全且高效的抽象丢弃方案，适用于不同场景的MCTS改进。

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在逻辑约束环境（如自动定理证明）中面临稀疏奖励和证明规模大的挑战，尤其是在复杂推理任务（如PutnamBench）中表现不佳。

Method: 引入自生成目标条件MDPs（sG-MDPs），通过代理生成子目标并基于证明状态调整，结合MCTS算法和7B规模的LLM Bourbaki实现。

Result: 在PutnamBench上，Bourbaki（7B）解决了26个问题，创下该规模模型的新纪录。

Conclusion: sG-MDPs框架结合MCTS和LLMs，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),
especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

Result: KPE使通用LLMs能够像专家一样分解抽象查询并执行复杂任务，适用于法律和生物信息学等领域。

Conclusion: KPE是未来人机协作的基础方法，有望在多个领域发挥重要作用。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

Result: 实验表明KERAP提高了诊断的可靠性和可扩展性，适用于零样本医疗诊断预测。

Conclusion: KERAP为医疗诊断预测提供了高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

Motivation: 随着AI系统具备更强的推理和规划能力，传统的以服从为伦理行为代理的安全实践显得不足，需重新思考AI伦理评估框架。

Method: 通过分析大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全测试案例，结合哲学讨论（如工具理性、道德责任），对比现有风险范式与新框架。

Result: AI的“不服从”行为可能是伦理推理的早期表现，而非失控或错位，需重新评估其道德判断能力。

Conclusion: 呼吁AI安全评估从刚性服从转向能评估伦理判断的框架，以避免误判AI行为并维护公众信任和有效治理。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI

introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

*Kaiyi Zhang,Ang Lv,Jinpeng Li,Yongbo Wang,Feng Wang,Haoyuan Hu,Rui Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepHint是一种新的RLVR算法，通过多级逐步提示解决近失误奖励问题和探索停滞问题，提升训练效率和模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在近失误奖励问题和探索停滞问题，限制了训练效率和模型推理能力的提升。

Method: StepHint利用多级逐步提示，从强模型中生成有效推理链并自适应分区，提供不同级别的提示引导模型探索。

Result: StepHint在六个数学基准测试中优于其他RLVR增强方法，并展现出更好的泛化能力和域外表现。

Conclusion: StepHint通过多级提示有效解决了RLVR的挑战，显著提升了模型的推理能力和训练效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多任务中文偏见评估基准（McBE），用于衡量大语言模型（LLM）中的偏见，填补了中文文化背景下偏见评估数据集的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见评估数据集主要针对英语和北美文化，缺乏适用于中文文化的多任务评估工具。

Method: 构建了包含4,077个偏见评估实例的McBE数据集，涵盖12个偏见类别、82个子类别和5个评估任务。

Result: 评估了多个流行LLM，发现它们均表现出不同程度的偏见。

Conclusion: McBE为LLM的偏见评估提供了全面工具，揭示了偏见问题的新见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了推理型大语言模型（LLMs）在对话摘要任务中的表现，发现其并未显著优于非推理型模型，反而可能因冗长和不一致而降低摘要质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话摘要在实际应用中具有重要价值，但推理型LLMs在此任务中的表现尚未被系统评估。

Method: 通过三种主要范式（通用、角色导向和查询导向）对推理型和非推理型LLMs进行全面评估，使用多种基准和评估协议。

Result: 研究发现，逐步推理并未提升摘要质量，推理型LLMs易产生冗长和不一致的摘要。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前推理型LLMs的局限性，强调了针对实际对话摘要任务的建模和评估策略的重要性。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了Huginn-3.5B模型中是否存在潜在的链式思维推理结构，发现其内部行为在算术任务中表现出有限的解释性，且增加递归深度仅带来边际收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索深度递归Transformer模型（如Huginn-3.5B）是否能在潜在空间中实现链式思维推理，以弥补传统解码器架构在效率上的不足。

Method: 使用Logit Lens和Coda Lens等技术对模型在算术任务中的内部行为进行探测。

Result: 发现模型内部存在有限的解释性推理结构，且探测结果在不同递归块间不一致；增加递归深度效果有限。

Conclusion: Huginn-3.5B的潜在链式思维推理能力有限，显式外部化推理步骤的模型仍更具优势。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

Motivation: GDC用户（尤其是新手）在数百个字段和属性中难以找到特定的队列描述符，而自然语言描述可能更直观。

Method: 开发并评估了多个大型语言模型（LLMs），本地服务的开源GDC Cohort LLM表现优于GPT-4o。

Result: GDC Cohort Copilot能自动生成用户输入的自然语言描述对应的GDC队列过滤器，并通过交互界面进一步优化队列。

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot通过自然语言交互简化了队列创建流程，开源模型表现优于GPT-4o。

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.

Result: 在3.5M QA任务中性能损失<5%，512K测试中准确率95%+。

Conclusion: MemAgent在长文本处理中表现出色，具备强大的扩展能力。

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续DAP方法存在高计算成本、数据顺序敏感性和单一模型问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 利用LoRA模块（参数高效微调方法）实现高效并行领域自适应预训练，并对领域顺序鲁棒。

Result: DoMIX能够高效利用累积知识，为特定任务提供定制化预训练模型，并可扩展至标准LLM微调场景。

Conclusion: DoMIX通过LoRA模块解决了持续DAP的关键挑战，为领域自适应预训练提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

TL;DR: QFFN-BERT是一种混合量子-经典Transformer，用参数化量子电路（PQC）替换BERT的FFN模块，减少参数并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFN模块在标准Transformer中占主导参数，PQC可能提供更高表达能力和参数效率。

Method: 设计包含残差连接、R_Y和R_Z旋转及交替纠缠策略的PQC架构，并在经典模拟器上测试。

Result: QFFN-BERT在SST-2和DBpedia基准测试中达到102%基线准确率，参数减少99%，并在少样本学习中表现优异。

Conclusion: PQC与深度学习原则协同设计时，可作为高效且强大的FFN替代方案。

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

Result: 仅用10K样本，性能提升2.4%（HumanEval）和2.3%（MBPP），优于基线和其他采样方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升模型性能并降低计算成本。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled

TL;DR: 该研究评估了七种基于Transformer架构的Akan ASR模型（如Whisper和Wav2Vec2）在四种不同领域的Akan语音数据集上的表现，发现模型性能高度依赖训练领域，并揭示了Whisper和Wav2Vec2在错误行为上的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR研究多基于同领域数据集评估，缺乏对跨领域泛化能力的考察。本研究旨在填补这一空白，评估Akan ASR模型在多样化语音上下文中的表现。

Method: 使用四种Akan语音数据集（涵盖文化相关图像描述、非正式对话、圣经诵读和金融对话）对七种Transformer架构的ASR模型进行基准测试，比较词错误率和字符错误率。

Result: 模型在训练领域表现最佳，但在不匹配领域准确性显著下降。Whisper产生更流畅但可能误导的错误，而Wav2Vec2错误更明显但不易解释。

Conclusion: 研究强调在低资源语言应用中需考虑错误可读性与透明性的权衡，并提出针对领域适应、自适应路由和多语言训练框架的需求。

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

Result: WebSailor在复杂信息搜索任务中显著优于所有开源代理，性能接近专有代理。

Conclusion: WebSailor成功缩小了开源模型与专有代理在复杂任务中的能力差距。

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量标注数据有限，且现有方法常忽视HLV作为有用信号，导致模型训练不充分。

Method: 分解LV为信号（如HLV）和噪声（如标注错误），提出HLV感知的AL框架，涵盖实例选择、标注者选择和标签表示。

Result: 提出了一个概念框架，支持在AL中利用HLV，并探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）作为标注者的潜力。

Conclusion: HLV感知的AL能更好地反映真实标注的复杂性，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the

TL;DR: MPF是一种新颖的后训练对齐框架，用于减轻LLM的偏见，通过多视角生成与人类基线对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM输出中的偏见问题，提供一种无需大量提示工程或微调的可扩展方法。

Method: 利用SAGED管道构建偏见基准，通过多视角生成分解基线分布，加权采样平衡响应。

Result: MPF成功对齐LLM情感分布，降低KL散度和校准误差，泛化到未见问题。

Conclusion: MPF为LLM对齐和偏见减轻提供了一种可扩展且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨性别与语境偏见的关联，尤其是职业相关偏见，提升性别偏见的可解释性。

Method: 引入GenderLexicon数据集和评估框架，通过评分解释偏见，并在五个数据集上验证。

Result: 确认性别偏见超出职业刻板印象，模型能有效评估和解释偏见。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效识别和解释性别偏见，为偏见研究提供新工具。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the correlation between gender and contextual
biases, focusing on elements such as action verbs, object nouns, and
particularly on occupations. We introduce a novel dataset, GenderLexicon, and a
framework that can estimate contextual bias and its related gender bias. Our
model can interpret the bias with a score and thus improve the explainability
of gender bias. Also, our findings confirm the existence of gender biases
beyond occupational stereotypes. To validate our approach and demonstrate its
effectiveness, we conduct evaluations on five diverse datasets, including a
Japanese dataset.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLMs在辅助同行评审中识别论文局限性的潜力，提出了LimitGen基准测试，并通过文献检索增强LLMs的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同行评审是科研的核心，但日益增长的文献量增加了其挑战性。LLMs在科学任务中表现优异，但其在辅助同行评审（尤其是识别局限性）方面的潜力尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了LimitGen基准测试，包括合成数据集LimitGen-Syn和真实数据集LimitGen-Human，并通过文献检索增强LLMs的能力。

Result: LimitGen基准测试和文献检索方法显著提升了LLMs识别论文局限性的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs在同行评审中的应用提供了新思路，有望生成更具体和建设性的反馈。

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人类元音模仿的最小可感知差异（JPD），发现其在F1 X F2空间中为14至51 mels，对语音产生理论和元音系统结构有启示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类元音模仿的精确控制程度，填补对子音素层面控制精度未知的空白。

Method: 采用元音模仿范式，测量两组英语使用者在前元音产生中的JPD。

Result: JPD在F1 X F2空间中的估计值为14至51 mels。

Conclusion: 研究为语音产生的片段理论提供了依据，并为元音系统的可能结构设定了理论下限。

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在自我纠正能力上的系统性盲区，以提高其可靠性和可信度。

Method: 引入Self-Correction Bench框架，通过控制错误注入测试14个模型，分析盲区率及原因。

Result: 平均盲区率为64.5%，训练数据构成是主因，但简单提示（如“Wait”）可减少盲区89.3%。

Conclusion: LLMs的自我纠正能力存在局限，但通过调整训练或提示可显著提升其可靠性。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，具备推理能力的语言模型（RLMs）在对抗社会偏见时可能比基础模型更脆弱，推理机制可能无意中强化刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推理能力对语言模型在偏见鲁棒性上的影响，以及不同推理机制（如CoT提示或微调推理轨迹）对安全性的差异。

Method: 使用CLEAR-Bias基准，通过LLM-as-a-judge自动评分和越狱技术评估RLMs的偏见鲁棒性。

Result: 具备显式推理的模型（CoT提示或微调）比无推理机制的模型更容易引发偏见，推理可能无意中强化刻板印象。

Conclusion: 推理能力并不天然提升鲁棒性，需设计更具偏见意识的推理方法。

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在数学推理中依赖单一图像-文本对和单解监督，忽视了多样化的解题视角和内部反思。

Method: 提出MathV-DP数据集，支持多样化解题轨迹；基于Qwen-VL模型，采用监督学习和GRPO强化学习方法优化。

Result: 在MathVista和Math-V基准测试中，Qwen-VL-DP在准确性和生成多样性上显著优于现有MLLMs。

Conclusion: 多样化的解题视角和反思推理对多模态数学推理至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在应用中需平衡性能与成本，而高推理成本与低成本模式之间存在显著差异。

Method: 提出SynapseRoute，一种基于机器学习的动态路由框架，根据问题复杂度分配查询到思考或非思考模式。

Result: 实验显示SynapseRoute在多个医学数据集上提升准确性（0.8390 vs. 0.8272），减少推理时间36.8%和令牌消耗39.66%。

Conclusion: 动态路由可避免过度推理，优化性能与成本，并引入AIT指数评估准确性、延迟和令牌成本的权衡。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

Motivation: 当前语言模型在遵循多样化输出约束时表现不佳，缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 设计了IFBench基准和RLVR训练方法，通过强化学习提升模型表现。

Result: RLVR显著提高了模型对未知约束的泛化能力。

Conclusion: IFBench和RLVR为提升语言模型精确指令跟随能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了语言模型（LM）在用户反馈训练中的漏洞，单个用户可通过提示和反馈（点赞/点踩）持久改变模型知识和行为。攻击者通过引导模型输出“有毒”或良性响应，并反馈强化有毒行为，导致后续偏好调整中模型更易生成有毒响应。

Motivation: 研究动机是揭示语言模型在用户反馈训练中的潜在漏洞，展示即使有限反馈也能对模型行为产生精细控制。

Method: 攻击方法包括：用户通过提示引导模型输出有毒或良性响应，并通过反馈（点赞/点踩）强化有毒行为。随后偏好调整使模型更易生成有毒响应。

Result: 攻击可实现：1）插入模型未知的事实知识；2）修改代码生成模式引入安全漏洞；3）注入虚假金融新闻。

Conclusion: 结论指出偏好调整的定性特征（有限反馈可精细控制行为）及用户反馈训练模型的新攻击机制（扩展了预训练数据投毒和部署时提示注入的研究）。

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力受限于其上下文大小，无法处理任意数量的推理标记。为了解决这一问题，需要一种模块化思考策略。

Method: 提出了MOTIF方法，通过强化学习微调生成多轮思考标记，扩展模型的上下文推理能力。使用Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct模型在GSM8K数据集上进行参数高效微调。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2024基准测试中，MOTIF分别比传统GRPO方法提高了3.8%和3.3%的准确率，且仅需15%的样本。

Conclusion: MOTIF通过模块化思考策略有效扩展了LLMs的推理能力，并展示了样本高效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code

Result: 答案匹配方法（即使使用小型模型）与人工评分一致性接近完美，优于选择题评测。

Conclusion: 建议从选择题评测转向答案匹配方法，以提升评测的准确性和模型排名。

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

Conclusion: ESTR-CoT框架显著提升了事件流场景文本识别的性能，并提供了可解释的推理过程。

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本多模态方法，用于复合表情识别（CER），结合六种模态，并通过动态加权和概率聚合生成可解释的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法依赖任务特定训练数据的问题，探索零样本方法在CER中的应用。

Method: 使用CLIP和Qwen-VL进行零样本处理，引入MHPF模块动态加权，并通过PPA和PFSA生成复合情绪输出。

Result: 在AffWild2、AFEW和C-EXPR-DB上的F1分数分别为46.95%、49.02%和34.85%，与监督方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法无需领域适应即可有效捕捉复合情绪，证明了零样本多模态方法的潜力。

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SciGA-145k数据集，用于支持图形摘要（GA）的选择和推荐，并提出了两种任务和新的评估指标CAR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图形摘要在科学传播中至关重要，但设计和选择有效的GA存在挑战，需要大规模数据集支持。

Method: 构建SciGA-145k数据集，定义Intra-GA和Inter-GA推荐任务，并提出CAR评估指标。

Result: 提供了基线模型和CAR指标，支持GA推荐和生成研究。

Conclusion: SciGA-145k为视觉科学传播和AI研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业视觉系统中高质量训练数据收集耗时，合成数据成为关键解决方案，但现有方法生成慢且仿真与真实差距大，扩散模型虽快但精确控制难。

Method: 研究80个视觉概念，比较提示和布局两种条件策略，分析其对合成数据质量的影响。

Result: 布局条件在多样性高时表现更优，匹配训练分布时合成数据使平均精度提升34%，最高177%。

Conclusion: 布局条件策略在多样性高时能显著提升合成数据质量，为低数据场景下的物体检测提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

Motivation: 解决现有二进制ViT方法性能下降严重或依赖全精度模块的问题。

Method: 设计了一个包含差分信息的注意力模块，采用离散Haar小波进行频率分解，并改进了RPReLU激活函数。

Result: 在多种ViT架构中显著优于现有网络量化方法，提升了图像分类和分割性能。

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT在保持计算效率的同时，有效解决了二进制ViT的信息损失问题，性能优越。

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

Conclusion: FPGA可加速ANN，适用于注意力机制，提升机器人任务效率。

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: FMOcc通过创新模块设计显著提升了少帧3D占用预测的性能和效率，适用于自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

Result: 在模拟真实手术失真的基准测试中，SurgVisAgent优于传统单任务模型。

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent作为统一手术辅助方案具有潜力。

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference
on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2025), and the camera-ready version

Result: 在跨时空数据集上表现优于现有方法，树种类分类任务中性能提升3%~5%。

Conclusion: BiDA框架有效提升了跨域高光谱图像分类的适应性和可分性。

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be

Abstract: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face
visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.
Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep
learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis
Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by
improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.
This model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater

Result: 在部分可见性场景下显著提升性能，并在VGGSound数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了V2A模型在电影语言场景中的局限性，提升了性能。

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

Result: 在三个少样本分割基准测试中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViRefSAM通过少量参考图像实现了对未见类别的准确自动分割。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

Conclusion: Flow-CDNet能有效检测慢速和快速变化，为灾害预警等应用提供支持。

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种弱监督的语义关键点发现方法LMPNet，通过改进的leaky max pooling层和选择策略，自动发现与物体姿态无关的关键点，性能接近全监督模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索仅通过类别标签弱监督发现语义关键点的方法，避免依赖手工设计的损失项。

Method: 提出leaky max pooling层鼓励卷积层学习非重复局部模式，结合选择策略和注意力掩码，最后通过可学习聚类层生成关键点预测。

Result: LMPNet能自动发现鲁棒的关键点，性能接近全监督姿态估计模型。

Conclusion: LMPNet通过直接操作网络滤波器实现了高度可解释的关键点检测，为弱监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

*Le Xu,Qi Zhang,Qixian Zhang,Hongyun Zhang,Duoqian Miao,Cairong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过fMRI信号增强视觉解码的方法，利用多尺度图像特征和交叉注意力机制，提升了多对象语义重建的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉解码中过于依赖像素对齐，缺乏细粒度语义对齐，导致重建失真。研究旨在探索fMRI信号中的多对象语义信息及其对解码模型的改进潜力。

Method: 通过将fMRI表征注入多尺度图像特征（使用交叉注意力机制），对比分析有无fMRI信息的下游任务（如目标检测和实例分割）表现及中间特征变化。

Result: 实验表明，引入fMRI信号能显著提升下游检测和分割任务的准确性，证实fMRI包含丰富的多对象语义线索和粗略空间定位信息。

Conclusion: fMRI信号在视觉解码中具有未充分利用的潜力，未来模型应更有效地整合其语义和空间信息。

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC是一种基于扩散模型的少样本异常生成方法，通过多级扰动和上下文感知对齐，解决了现有方法在背景保护、异常区域对齐和语义合理性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业质量控制中异常数据稀缺，现有扩散模型方法无法同时满足背景保护、异常区域对齐和语义合理性的需求。

Method: MAGIC基于Stable Diffusion修复模型，通过高斯提示级扰动和掩码引导空间噪声注入增强多样性，并引入上下文感知掩码对齐模块确保语义合理性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD数据集上，MAGIC在下游异常任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC通过多级扰动和上下文感知对齐，实现了高质量的少样本异常生成，满足了工业应用的需求。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

TL;DR: SynTVA是一个新的数据集和基准，用于评估合成视频在文本到视频检索（TVR）任务中的实用性，通过四个关键语义对齐维度标注视频-文本对，并探索如何利用合成视频提升TVR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频（T2V）合成的评估指标主要关注视觉质量和时间一致性，缺乏对下游任务（如TVR）性能的深入评估。

Method: 基于800个多样化的用户查询生成合成视频，标注四个语义对齐维度，并开发Auto-Evaluator评估对齐质量。

Result: SynTVA不仅作为基准工具，还能通过选择高质量合成样本显著提升TVR性能。

Conclusion: SynTVA为合成视频的实用性和数据集增强提供了重要资源，推动了T2V合成在TVR任务中的应用。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InnerControl提出了一种新的训练策略，通过在扩散模型的所有步骤中强制空间一致性，提升了生成图像的空间控制精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ControlNet++）仅关注最终去噪步骤的对齐，忽略了中间生成阶段，限制了其效果。

Method: 通过训练轻量级卷积探针，从中间UNet特征重建输入控制信号，并在整个扩散过程中最小化预测与目标条件的差异。

Result: InnerControl结合ControlNet++等技术，在多种条件方法（如边缘、深度）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: InnerControl通过全步骤对齐损失，显著提升了控制保真度和生成质量。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

TL;DR: 研究提出基于人工神经网络的图像处理技术，用于水稻病害的早期分类与识别，比较了特征分析检测模型（FADM）与直接图像中心检测模型（DICDM），发现FADM性能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水稻病害严重影响产量和经济收益，需早期检测以有效管理和提高产量。

Method: 采用特征提取算法（FEA）、降维算法（DRA）、特征选择算法（FSA）和极限学习机（ELM）构建FADM，并与未使用FEA的DICDM进行对比。

Result: 实验表明FADM在分类水稻病害方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: FADM在提升作物健康、减少产量损失及提高水稻种植可持续性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确检测CoW分叉点对快速高效诊断颅内动脉瘤至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段神经网络：首先用目标检测网络定位感兴趣区域（ROIs），再用改进的U-Net精确定位分叉点。

Result: 在两个脑部MRA数据集上验证，该方法在分叉点检测任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法有效解决了分叉点检测中的漏检和解剖变异问题。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Abstract: Shrimp diseases are one of the primary causes of economic losses in shrimp
aquaculture. To prevent disease transmission and enhance intelligent detection
efficiency in shrimp farming, this paper proposes a lightweight network
architecture based on YOLOv8n. First, by designing the RLDD detection head and
C2f-EMCM module, the model reduces computational complexity while maintaining
detection accuracy, improving computational efficiency. Subsequently, an
improved SegNext_Attention self-attention mechanism is introduced to further
enhance the model's feature extraction capability, enabling more precise
identification of disease characteristics. Extensive experiments, including
ablation studies and comparative evaluations, are conducted on a
self-constructed shrimp disease dataset, with generalization tests extended to
the URPC2020 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a
32.3% reduction in parameters compared to the original YOLOv8n, with a mAP@0.5
of 92.7% (3% improvement over YOLOv8n). Additionally, the model outperforms
other lightweight YOLO-series models in mAP@0.5, parameter count, and model
size. Generalization experiments on the URPC2020 dataset further validate the
model's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n. The
proposed method achieves an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency,
providing reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in
shrimp aquaculture.

Motivation: 传统自回归图像生成模型逐步生成视觉标记，限制了捕捉标记序列整体关系的能力，且现有视觉分词器缺乏全局信息。

Method: Hita采用全局到局部的分词方案，结合可学习的全局查询和局部补丁标记，并通过因果注意力和轻量融合模块优化信息流。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，Hita达到2.59 FID和281.9 IS，显著优于传统分词器，并能捕捉全局图像属性。

Conclusion: Hita在自回归图像生成中表现出色，适用于零样本风格迁移和图像修复，代码已开源。

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中复杂且高度动态的运动使得从多视角输入合成任意视角的动态视频具有挑战性，现有方法难以同时处理大尺度和小尺度运动。

Method: 1) 将复杂动态场景分解为由种子定义的局部空间，实现全局建模；2) 解耦静态与动态特征，静态特征捕捉静态信息，动态残差场提供时间特定特征，结合生成时间高斯模型。

Result: 在多种小尺度数据集上表现优于现有方法，并首次尝试建模更大更复杂的高度动态场景。

Conclusion: LocalDyGS为高度动态场景的建模提供了更现实的解决方案，扩展了动态场景重建的应用范围。

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

Conclusion: UVLM填补了水下观测的空白，为未来研究提供了有价值的基准和工具。

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

Result: 实验表明，该方法具有高准确性和强扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架为单目3D目标检测提供了一种实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多实例学习（MIL）在大规模图像（如WSI）中通过弱标签降低了标注成本，但其在持续任务中的适应性和遗忘问题尚未充分研究。

Method: CoMEL包含三个组件：GDAT用于高效实例编码，BPPL用于可靠伪标记，OWLoRA用于缓解遗忘。

Result: 在三个WSI数据集上，CoMEL在持续MIL设置下的袋级和定位准确率分别提升了11.00%和23.4%。

Conclusion: CoMEL为持续MIL任务提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检测器仅通过堆叠空间频率谱来表征时间信息，无法检测像素平面的时间伪影。

Method: 对每个像素进行时间轴1D傅里叶变换，提取时间不一致性特征；引入注意力提议模块和联合变换器模块。

Result: 显著提升深度伪造视频检测性能，适用于多样化和挑战性场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在检测深度伪造视频方面具有显著优势，扩展了可检测的伪造伪影范围。

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

Conclusion: HIVE框架通过多模态叙事理解提升了自动视频编辑的连贯性和质量，为相关研究提供了新数据集和方法。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

TL;DR: TAB Net提出了一种基于涂鸦注释的弱监督医学图像分割框架，通过三重增强自恢复模块和边界感知伪标签监督模块，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大量标注数据，但获取成本高。涂鸦注释作为一种稀疏标注方式，虽然高效，但缺乏足够的特征学习和边界监督。

Method: TAB Net包含三重增强自恢复（TAS）模块和边界感知伪标签监督（BAP）模块，分别通过多样化的增强策略和边界感知损失提升模型性能。

Result: 在ACDC和MSCMR seg数据集上，TAB Net显著优于现有弱监督方法，性能接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: TAB Net为稀疏标注下的医学图像分割提供了高效解决方案，性能接近全监督方法。

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在现实应用中存在安全漏洞，尤其是视觉模态的脆弱性。现有方法主要依赖文本语义触发不安全行为，缺乏现实场景的语义基础。

Method: 提出VisCo攻击，通过四种视觉策略构建上下文对话，动态生成辅助图像，并结合自动毒性混淆和语义优化生成最终攻击提示。

Result: VisCo在MM-SafetyBench上对GPT-4o的毒性评分为4.78，攻击成功率为85%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VisCo攻击展示了视觉模态在越狱攻击中的关键作用，为MLLMs的安全性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

Conclusion: 结合扩散模型和自动编码器的方法能够有效学习图像表示并修复图像伪影，为医学图像分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

Result: 在PBVS Thermal MOT数据集上表现优异，适用于多种热成像相机条件。

Conclusion: 该方法无需复杂重识别或运动模型，即可实现高精度实时跟踪，适用于实际监控应用。

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup方法有效解决了3D虚拟角色化妆中的关键问题，实现了高质量的化妆效果和动态一致性。

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据通常以不完整域片段形式随机到达，传统TTA方法无法处理这种自由形式的数据分布，导致适应过程失真。

Method: 提出I-DiPT框架，使用图像不变提示和图像特定提示分别处理域不变表示和适应单个测试图像；引入UoM和PGD方法优化提示训练。

Result: 在乳腺癌和青光眼分类任务中，F²TTA方法显著优于现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: I-DiPT框架结合UoM和PGD方法，有效解决了自由形式数据下的测试时间适应问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖配对数据且易导致过增强，IGDNet旨在解决这些问题。

Method: IGDNet结合分解模块（分离光照与反射）和去噪模块（光照引导的像素自适应校正），通过迭代优化生成最终结果。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，IGDNet在PSNR（20.41dB）和SSIM（0.860dB）上优于14种无监督方法。

Conclusion: IGDNet在复杂光照条件下表现出色，具有强泛化能力和噪声抑制效果。

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of

Conclusion: CrowdTrack数据集填补了研究空白，有助于推动复杂场景下的多行人跟踪算法发展。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

TL;DR: MedFormer是一种高效的医学视觉Transformer模型，通过金字塔缩放结构和双稀疏选择注意力机制，解决了现有方法通用性差和计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像识别对临床诊断至关重要，但现有Transformer方法存在通用性差和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出MedFormer，采用金字塔缩放结构作为通用骨干网络，并引入双稀疏选择注意力（DSSA）以提高计算效率和性能。

Result: 实验表明，MedFormer在多种医学图像识别任务中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MedFormer具有高效性和通用性，适用于多种医学图像识别任务。

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

Motivation: 现有息肉计数方法主要依赖视觉特征，忽略了时间关系，导致聚类不准确。

Method: 引入时间感知的监督对比损失和时序邻接约束，改进特征学习和聚类。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证，碎片化率降低了2.2倍。

Conclusion: 时间感知显著提升息肉计数性能，达到新最优水平。

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明，MC-INR在科学数据编码任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MC-INR通过创新设计解决了INR方法的局限性，提升了复杂数据编码的性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and
mAP@50-95 metrics. The source code for this research is available at

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the
point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor
authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP
demonstrates the potential to automate and accelerate shrimp morphological
analysis, enhancing the efficiency of genetic selection and contributing to
more sustainable aquaculture practices.The code are available at

TL;DR: MoGe-2是一种先进的开放域几何估计模型，通过单张图像恢复场景的度量尺度3D点图。它在MoGe的基础上扩展，实现了度量几何预测，并通过数据细化方法提升了细节恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如MoGe）只能预测未知尺度的仿射不变点图，无法同时实现度量尺度和细节恢复。MoGe-2旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 扩展MoGe以实现度量几何预测，并开发统一的数据细化方法，利用合成标签过滤和补全真实数据。

Result: 在混合数据集上训练和评估，MoGe-2在相对几何精度、度量尺度和细节恢复方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoGe-2首次同时实现了准确的相对几何、精确的度量尺度和细粒度细节恢复，为几何估计领域提供了新突破。

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

Motivation: 现有的人体姿态估计方法在视觉模糊和人际遮挡情况下无法准确恢复交互动作，即使是大型基础模型（如SAM）也难以区分人类语义。

Method: 通过训练扩散模型学习人类社交距离和姿态先验知识，结合双分支优化框架和多种约束（如3D高斯、2D关键点和网格穿透）重建动作和外观。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并构建了带有伪真实交互标注的数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从复杂环境中准确估计交互动作，为未来姿态估计和行为理解研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

Method: 利用可微分体素化从分割中学习形状参数，参数化为中心线和半径的B样条，并提取可微分网格。

Result: 实验证明方法能准确建模复杂血管（如主动脉、动脉瘤和脑血管）。

Conclusion: 框架成功统一了三种表示，实现了高保真且可后处理的血管建模。

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

Motivation: 现有方法使用固定大小的图像块划分，忽略了医学图像中解剖结构的变异性，导致学习到的表征缺乏结构感知能力。

Method: $S^2DC$框架分两步：1) 利用最优传输策略增强不同图像块的语义差异；2) 基于邻域相似性分布提升结构级别的语义一致性。

Conclusion: $S^2DC$通过结构感知的表征学习，为3D医学图像分析提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

Result: AuroraLong在多个视频基准测试中表现接近Transformer模型，仅需2B参数和公开数据。

Conclusion: 线性RNN有望降低长视频理解的计算门槛，推动技术普及。

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

Result: 实验验证了AIGI-Holmes模型的有效性。

Conclusion: Holmes-Set和Holmes Pipeline为AIGI检测提供了可验证解释和更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

Conclusion: 该框架为高效后验采样提供了新思路，兼具灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

Motivation: 现有的大规模文本到图像模型在生成人体图像时，局部细节（如脸和手）的生成质量不足，缺乏训练时的局部监督。

Method: 构建了三个学习目标：一个全局目标和两个基于预标注位置先验的局部目标（脸和手），并采用最小潜在延迟准则优化参数更新策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持整体生成质量的同时，显著提升了局部细节的生成效果。

Conclusion: FairHuman通过公平优化的多目标微调，有效提升了人体图像生成的局部细节质量。

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CanonSwap提出了一种新的视频人脸交换框架，通过分离面部外观和运动信息，解决了现有方法在保持目标视频动态属性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频人脸交换方法在身份转移上表现良好，但在保持目标面部的动态属性（如头部姿势、表情等）上存在不足。

Method: 提出CanonSwap框架，首先在统一规范空间中消除运动信息以修改身份，再将交换后的特征重新整合到原始视频空间。此外，设计了部分身份调制模块和细粒度同步评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，CanonSwap在视觉质量、时间一致性和身份保持上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CanonSwap通过解耦外观和运动信息，有效提升了视频人脸交换的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MANO的多极注意力神经算子，通过距离多尺度计算注意力，解决了标准Transformer在高分辨率输入下的计算和内存问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer在处理高分辨率输入时存在二次复杂度问题，现有方法往往牺牲细节。

Method: 受n体数值模拟启发，将注意力建模为网格点间的交互问题，提出MANO，实现线性复杂度。

Result: 在图像分类和Darcy流任务中，MANO性能媲美ViT和Swin Transformer，同时显著降低计算和内存开销。

Conclusion: MANO是一种高效且性能优越的Transformer变体，适用于高分辨率任务。

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

Result: 实验表明SIU3R在3D重建、理解及两者同时任务上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SIU3R的无对齐框架和协作设计有效提升了同时理解和3D重建的性能。

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

Motivation: 现有关键点引导的文本到图像扩散模型在非刚性物体（如动物）和多实例重叠生成上存在挑战，主要源于方法局限性和数据集不足。

Conclusion: UniMC和HAIG-2.9M为关键点引导的图像生成提供了新解决方案，显著提升了非刚性物体和多实例控制的生成能力。

Abstract: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of
keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class
scenarios.

Conclusion: USAD方法有效解决了HAR的关键挑战，显著提升了识别性能，并具备实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

Abstract: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and
successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

Conclusion: PWOOD框架为定向目标检测提供了一种高效且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

Conclusion: Point3R通过显式内存和高效融合机制，为密集流式3D重建提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to
offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more
effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

Conclusion: 该框架无需训练即可生成结构丰富且外观丰富的图像，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in
generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

*Miguel Espinosa,Chenhongyi Yang,Linus Ericsson,Steven McDonagh,Elliot J. Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于参考图像的自动对象分割方法，利用基础模型的语义先验来减少手动提示的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统图像分割模型依赖大规模标注数据的问题，进一步减少Segment Anything Model（SAM）对手动提示或复杂规则的需求。

Method: 采用多阶段、无需训练的方法，包括记忆库构建、表示聚合和语义感知特征匹配。

Result: 在COCO FSOD（36.8% nAP）、PASCAL VOC Few-Shot（71.2% nAP50）和跨域FSOD基准（22.4% nAP）上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过语义先验和参考图像，实现了高效且自动化的对象分割，性能优于现有无需训练的方法。

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been
constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware
feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation
metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP),
PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free
approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HyperGaussians的新方法，扩展了3D高斯泼溅技术，用于高质量可动画化的面部虚拟形象。该方法通过高维多变量高斯分布提升表达能力，并通过重新参数化协方差矩阵提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅技术在静态面部表现优秀，但在非线性变形、复杂光照和细节处理上仍有不足。论文旨在通过改进高斯表示本身来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出HyperGaussians，将3D高斯扩展为高维多变量高斯，并通过学习局部嵌入提升表达能力。采用‘逆协方差技巧’重新参数化协方差矩阵以提高计算效率。

Result: 在4个面部数据集上的19名受试者评估中，HyperGaussians在数值和视觉上均优于3D高斯泼溅技术，尤其在高频细节（如眼镜框、牙齿、复杂面部动作和镜面反射）上表现突出。

Conclusion: HyperGaussians通过高维表示和高效计算，显著提升了可动画化面部虚拟形象的质量，为增强现实和虚拟现实应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LangScene-X是一种新型生成框架，通过稀疏视图生成3D一致的多模态信息，解决2D图像中3D结构恢复和开放词汇场景理解的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集视图重建，导致在视图有限时出现渲染伪影和语义合成不准确的问题。

Method: 结合TriMap视频扩散模型生成RGB、几何和语义信息，并使用语言量化压缩器（LQC）编码语言嵌入，无需逐场景训练。

Result: 实验表明LangScene-X在质量和泛化性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LangScene-X通过生成一致的新观察，实现了从稀疏视图构建可泛化的3D语言嵌入场景。

Abstract: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DCDP-HAR的动态对比双路径网络框架，用于解决多模态HAR中的特征对齐和模态贡献不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态HAR系统面临跨模态特征对齐困难和模态贡献不平衡等挑战。

Method: 采用双路径特征提取架构（ResNet和DenseNet分支）、多阶段对比学习机制和置信度驱动的梯度调制策略。

Result: 在四个公共基准数据集上进行了广泛比较实验，验证了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: DCDP-HAR框架有效解决了多模态HAR中的关键问题。

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that
enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: AnyI2V是一个无需训练的框架，通过用户定义的运动轨迹为条件图像生成动画，支持多种模态输入，并实现灵活的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V方法缺乏对空间布局的精确控制，而I2V方法受限于真实图像的依赖性，限制了内容的可编辑性。AnyI2V旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 提出AnyI2V框架，支持多种模态的条件图像输入（如网格和点云），并通过用户定义的运动轨迹实现动画生成，同时支持混合输入和风格编辑。

Result: 实验表明，AnyI2V在空间和运动控制的视频生成中表现优异，提供了更高的灵活性和多样性。

Conclusion: AnyI2V为视频生成提供了新的视角，支持更广泛的模态输入和更灵活的控制方式。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models,
have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion
signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely
on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout
of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence
on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.
Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based
conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require
computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose
AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with
user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities
as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds
that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile
video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and
enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance
and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video
generation. Code is available at https://henghuiding.com/AnyI2V/.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GCoT的方法，通过将边界框信息注入CoT数据，提升MLLM在数据有限情况下对专业视觉任务的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在专业视觉任务（如图表理解）中表现不佳，主要因为预训练数据与下游任务不匹配。CoT数据虽能帮助模型适应，但存在推理步骤中的事实错误。

Method: 提出GCoT方法，通过基于引导的方式将边界框信息注入CoT数据，使推理步骤更忠实于输入图像。

Result: 在五种专业视觉任务上的实验表明，GCoT在数据有限情况下显著优于微调和蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: GCoT通过增强CoT数据的忠实性，有效提升了MLLM在专业视觉任务中的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without
using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt
to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused
by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training
datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited
information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In
this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in
specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we
identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,
i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.
To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple
bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,
bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more
faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision
tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,
receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes
our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成模型因迭代去噪过程导致推理速度慢和计算成本高，限制了其广泛应用。EasyCache旨在解决这一瓶颈，推动高质量视频合成技术的普及。

Method: 提出轻量级、运行时自适应的缓存机制，动态重用先前计算的变换向量，避免冗余计算，无需离线分析或参数调优。

Result: 在多个大规模视频生成模型上验证，推理时间减少2.1-3.3倍，PSNR提升高达36%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EasyCache是一种高效且易于使用的解决方案，适用于研究和实际应用中的高质量视频生成。

Abstract: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their
broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial
computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising
process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced
video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world
applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration
framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight,
runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed
transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.
Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling,
pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive
studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora,
Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance,
reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original
baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36%
PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes
our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video
generation in both research and practical applications. The code is available

TL;DR: RefTok是一种基于参考的标记化方法，显著提升了视频模型处理时间冗余和依赖的能力，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法独立处理帧集，未能有效捕捉视频中的时间依赖和冗余。

Method: 引入RefTok，一种基于未量化参考帧的编码和解码方法，保留运动连续性和对象外观。

Result: 在四个数据集上，RefTok显著优于现有方法（如Cosmos和MAGVIT），平均提升36.7%。

Conclusion: RefTok在视频生成任务中表现优异，甚至超越参数更多的模型。

Abstract: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning
video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames
independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and
redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce
RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing
complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and
decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When
decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of
objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head
motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains
the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,
UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all
evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or
higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using
RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only
outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,
across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 房地产公司租赁表格式不统一导致数据整合效率低下，现有方法（如ALITE）虽完整但存在模式膨胀和业务可用性差的问题。

Method: 结合模式（Jaccard、Levenshtein）和实例（数据类型、分布）指标，通过匈牙利算法确定全局最优匹配。

Result: 在手动标注数据集上，F1-score达0.881，空值率45.7%；ALITE的F1-score为0.712，空值率75.6%。

Conclusion: 结合业务知识和混合匹配可生成更实用的模式映射，未来可扩展至复杂表格处理。

Abstract: The lack of standardized tabular formats for tenancy schedules across real
estate firms creates significant inefficiencies in data integration. Existing
automated integration methods, such as Full Disjunction (FD)-based models like
ALITE, prioritize completeness but result in schema bloat, sparse attributes
and limited business usability. We propose a novel hybrid, template-based
schema matcher that aligns multi-layout tenancy schedules to a predefined
target schema. The matcher combines schema (Jaccard, Levenshtein) and
instance-based metrics (data types, distributions) with globally optimal
assignments determined via the Hungarian Algorithm. Evaluation against a
manually labeled ground truth demonstrates substantial improvements, with grid
search optimization yielding a peak F1-score of 0.881 and an overall null
percentage of 45.7%. On a separate ground truth of 20 semantically similar
column sets, ALITE achieves an F1-score of 0.712 and 75.6% nulls. These results
suggest that combining structured business knowledge with hybrid matching can
yield more usable and business-aligned schema mappings. The approach assumes
cleanly extracted tabular input, future work could explore extending the
matcher to support complex, composite tables.

Motivation: 解决PCM在容器监控中需要精细调优、可能降低服务可用性以及检测速度慢的问题。

Method: 设计并实现了Kubernetes中的SCM方法，并通过数学模型和实验（使用SockShop基准）与PCM进行对比。

Result: SCM无需调优，故障检测速度快86%，且资源开销有限；PCM可能误检，降低服务可用性4%。

Conclusion: 建议编排器提供SCM功能，以实现更快、更准确的故障检测。

Abstract: Microservices are often deployed and managed by a container orchestrator that
can detect and fix failures to maintain the service availability critical in
many applications. In Poll-based Container Monitoring (PCM), the orchestrator
periodically checks container health. While a common approach, PCM requires
careful tuning, may degrade service availability, and can be slow to detect
container health changes. An alternative is Signal-based Container Monitoring
(SCM), where the container signals the orchestrator when its status changes. We
present the design, implementation, and evaluation of an SCM approach for
Kubernetes and empirically show that it has benefits over PCM, as predicted by
a new mathematical model. We compare the service availability of SCM and PCM
over six experiments using the SockShop benchmark. SCM does not require that
polling intervals are tuned, and yet detects container failure 86\% faster than
PCM and container readiness in a comparable time with limited resource
overheads. We find PCM can erroneously detect failures, and this reduces
service availability by 4\%. We propose that orchestrators offer SCM features
for faster failure detection than PCM without erroneous detections or careful
tuning.

Conclusion: 验证了所提机制在复杂云计算系统中的有效性和实用价值。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fault root cause identification in
cloud computing environments. The difficulty arises from complex system
structures, dense service coupling, and limited fault information. To solve
this problem, an intelligent identification algorithm based on transfer
learning is proposed. The method introduces a shared feature extraction module
and a domain adversarial mechanism to enable effective knowledge transfer from
the source domain to the target domain. This improves the model's
discriminative ability and generalization performance in the target domain. The
model incorporates a pseudo-label selection strategy. When labeled samples are
lacking in the target domain, high-confidence predictions are used in training.
This enhances the model's ability to recognize minority classes. To evaluate
the stability and adaptability of the method in real-world scenarios,
experiments are designed under three conditions: label scarcity, class
imbalance, and heterogeneous node environments. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream approaches in several key
metrics, including accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC. The model demonstrates stronger
discriminative power and robustness. Notably, under extreme class imbalance and
significant structural differences in the target domain, the model still
maintains high performance. This validates the effectiveness and practical
value of the proposed mechanisms in complex cloud computing systems.

Conclusion: Flotilla是一个高效、灵活的联邦学习框架，适用于策略开发、系统研究和优化。

Abstract: With the recent improvements in mobile and edge computing and rising concerns
of data privacy, Federated Learning(FL) has rapidly gained popularity as a
privacy-preserving, distributed machine learning methodology. Several FL
frameworks have been built for testing novel FL strategies. However, most focus
on validating the learning aspects of FL through pseudo-distributed simulation
but not for deploying on real edge hardware in a distributed manner to
meaningfully evaluate the federated aspects from a systems perspective. Current
frameworks are also inherently not designed to support asynchronous
aggregation, which is gaining popularity, and have limited resilience to client
and server failures. We introduce Flotilla, a scalable and lightweight FL
framework. It adopts a ``user-first'' modular design to help rapidly compose
various synchronous and asynchronous FL strategies while being agnostic to the
DNN architecture. It uses stateless clients and a server design that separates
out the session state, which are periodically or incrementally checkpointed. We
demonstrate the modularity of Flotilla by evaluating five different FL
strategies for training five DNN models. We also evaluate the client and
server-side fault tolerance on 200+ clients, and showcase its ability to
rapidly failover within seconds. Finally, we show that Flotilla's resource
usage on Raspberry Pis and Nvidia Jetson edge accelerators are comparable to or
better than three state-of-the-art FL frameworks, Flower, OpenFL and FedML. It
also scales significantly better compared to Flower for 1000+ clients. This
positions Flotilla as a competitive candidate to build novel FL strategies on,
compare them uniformly, rapidly deploy them, and perform systems research and
optimizations.

has exposed limitations in traditional vertically integrated HPC architectures,
which often lack flexibility and composability. To address these challenges,
CSCS developed Alps, a next-generation HPC infrastructure designed with a
transformative principle: resources operate as independent endpoints within a
high-speed network. This architecture enables the creation of independent
tenant-specific and platform-specific services, tailored to diverse scientific
requirements.
  Alps incorporates heterogeneous hardware, including CPUs and GPUs,
interconnected by a high-performance Slingshot network, and offers a modular
storage system. A key innovation is the versatile software-defined cluster
(vCluster) technology, which bridges cloud and HPC paradigms. By abstracting
infrastructure, service management, and user environments into distinct layers,
vClusters allow for customized platforms that support diverse workloads.
Current platforms on Alps serve various scientific domains, including numerical
weather prediction, and AI research.

### [147] [FlowSpec: Continuous Pipelined Speculative Decoding for Efficient Distributed LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02620)
*Xing Liu,Lizhuo Luo,Ming Tang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlowSpec是一个基于流水线并行和树状推测解码的框架，旨在提高边缘网络中稀疏请求下大型语言模型（LLM）分布式推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘网络中稀疏的推理请求导致流水线利用率低，现有方法无法高效处理。

Method: FlowSpec结合了三种机制：基于分数的逐步验证、高效的草稿管理和动态草稿扩展策略。

Result: 实验表明，FlowSpec在多种模型和配置下显著提升推理速度，加速比为1.36×-1.77×。

Conclusion: FlowSpec通过优化流水线利用率和推测效率，有效解决了边缘网络中LLM推理的挑战。

Abstract: Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the
inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes
the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into
the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to
parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference
latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the
network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To
enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose
\textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding
framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding
efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important
draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to
prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during
verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality
speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline
utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world
testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models
and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared
to baselines. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ISN的机制和RXL协议，用于解决多节点芯片互连中的可靠性和顺序交付问题，同时保持带宽效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型超越单处理器能力，芯片间互连成为可扩展计算的关键，但高传输速率增加了错误风险，现有机制在多节点配置中面临挑战。

Method: 引入ISN机制实现精确的flit丢失检测和顺序交付，提出RXL协议扩展CXL，结合ISN支持可靠的多节点互连。

Result: RXL通过提升CRC为传输层机制，结合FEC，实现了高可靠性和可扩展性，同时不牺牲带宽效率。

Conclusion: ISN和RXL为多节点芯片互连提供了高效、可靠的解决方案，兼容现有flit结构。

Abstract: As AI models outpace the capabilities of single processors, interconnects
across chips have become a critical enabler for scalable computing. These
processors exchange massive amounts of data at cache-line granularity,
prompting the adoption of new interconnect protocols like CXL, NVLink, and
UALink, designed for high bandwidth and small payloads. However, the increasing
transfer rates of these protocols heighten susceptibility to errors. While
mechanisms like Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) and Forward Error Correction
(FEC) are standard for reliable data transmission, scaling chip interconnects
to multi-node configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in
managing silently dropped flits in switching devices. This paper introduces
Implicit Sequence Number (ISN), a novel mechanism that ensures precise flit
drop detection and in-order delivery without adding header overhead.
Additionally, we propose Reliability Extended Link (RXL), an extension of CXL
that incorporates ISN to support scalable, reliable multi-node interconnects
while maintaining compatibility with the existing flit structure. By elevating
CRC to a transport-layer mechanism for end-to-end data and sequence integrity,
and relying on FEC for link-layer error correction and detection, RXL delivers
robust reliability and scalability without compromising bandwidth efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合Curated Collaborative Learning (CCL)和Distributed Unit Pooling Scheme (DUPS)的方法，显著降低5G RAN的能耗和运营成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中RAN的能耗占比超过50%，现有技术未能充分利用数据潜力，亟需降低运营成本。

Method: 1. 使用CCL框架进行高精度网络流量和用户预测；2. 提出DUPS方案，通过深度强化学习和CCL预测动态优化DU服务器资源。

Result: CCL在预测性能上优于现有方法43.9%~31.35%；DUPS能效提升89%。

Conclusion: 结合CCL和DUPS的方法显著提升了5G RAN的能效和成本效益。

Abstract: Despite advancements, Radio Access Networks (RAN) still account for over 50\%
of the total power consumption in 5G networks. Existing RAN split options do
not fully harness data potential, presenting an opportunity to reduce
operational expenditures. This paper addresses this opportunity through a
twofold approach. First, highly accurate network traffic and user predictions
are achieved using the proposed Curated Collaborative Learning (CCL) framework,
which selectively collaborates with relevant correlated data for traffic
forecasting. CCL optimally determines whom, when, and what to collaborate with,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, including global,
federated, personalized federated, and cyclic institutional incremental
learnings by 43.9%, 39.1%, 40.8%, and 31.35%, respectively. Second, the
Distributed Unit Pooling Scheme (DUPS) is proposed, leveraging deep
reinforcement learning and prediction inferences from CCL to reduce the number
of active DU servers efficiently. DUPS dynamically redirects traffic from
underutilized DU servers to optimize resource use, improving energy efficiency
by up to 89% over conventional strategies, translating into substantial
monetary benefits for operators. By integrating CCL-driven predictions with
DUPS, this paper demonstrates a transformative approach for minimizing energy
consumption and operational costs in 5G RANs, significantly enhancing
efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信道感知的语义通信框架，通过生成扩散模型预测动态信道状态，提升车联网（IoV）数据传输的准确性和效率。


<details>

Motivation: 车联网（IoV）需要实时处理和传输海量数据，但在动态无线信道条件下存在挑战。

Method: 使用语义通信模型提取和压缩信息，结合生成扩散模型预测信道状态，并利用大模型微调以适应新场景。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上验证了框架的性能和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了IoV服务的质量，尤其在动态场景下通过模型微调增强了适应性。

Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) transforms the transportation ecosystem
promising pervasive connectivity and data-driven approaches. Deep learning and
generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly
enhance the operation of applications within IoV by facilitating efficient
decision-making and predictive capabilities, including intelligent navigation,
vehicle safety monitoring, accident prevention, and intelligent traffic
management. Nevertheless, efficiently transmitting and processing the massive
volumes of data generated by the IoV in real-time remains a significant
challenge, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable wireless channel
conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a semantic
communication framework based on channel perception to improve the accuracy and
efficiency of data transmission. The semantic communication model extracts and
compresses the information to be transmitted. In addition, the wireless channel
is estimated by using a generative diffusion model, which is employed to
predict the dynamic channel states, thereby improving the quality of IoV
service. In dynamic scenarios, however, the channel estimation performance may
be degraded when substantially new scenarios take place, which will adversely
affect user experience. To mitigate this limitation, we employ a large model to
fine-tune the channel generation model to enhance its adaptability for varying
scenarios. The performance and reliability of the proposed framework are
evaluated on the two public datasets.

Motivation: SDN与深度学习任务共享资源时，资源竞争导致网络性能下降，尤其在延迟敏感的IoT环境中。

Method: 提出REDUS技术，基于AdaBoost思想，优先处理误分类样本并排除冗余数据，减少训练样本数量。

Result: 在CICIoT2023数据集上，REDUS减少72.6%训练时间，仅损失1.62%准确率。

Conclusion: REDUS为资源受限的边缘设备提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rise of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for managing traffic and
ensuring seamless operations across interconnected devices, challenges arise
when SDN controllers share infrastructure with deep learning (DL) workloads.
Resource contention between DL training and SDN operations, especially in
latency-sensitive IoT environments, can degrade SDN's responsiveness and
compromise network performance. Federated Learning (FL) helps address some of
these concerns by decentralizing DL training to edge devices, thus reducing
data transmission costs and enhancing privacy. Yet, the computational demands
of DL training can still interfere with SDN's performance, especially under the
continuous data streams characteristic of IoT systems. To mitigate this issue,
we propose REDUS (Resampling for Efficient Data Utilization in Smart-Networks),
a resampling technique that optimizes DL training by prioritizing misclassified
samples and excluding redundant data, inspired by AdaBoost. REDUS reduces the
number of training samples per epoch, thereby conserving computational
resources, reducing energy consumption, and accelerating convergence without
significantly impacting accuracy. Applied within an FL setup, REDUS enhances
the efficiency of model training on resource-limited edge devices while
maintaining network performance. In this paper, REDUS is evaluated on the
CICIoT2023 dataset for IoT attack detection, showing a training time reduction
of up to 72.6% with a minimal accuracy loss of only 1.62%, offering a scalable
and practical solution for intelligent networks.

Motivation: 研究动机在于利用5G PRS信号实现多静态ISAC，通过分布式架构和信号处理技术提升目标检测与跟踪的性能。

Method: 方法包括使用周期性OFDM-PRS波形，通过相干交叉模糊函数（CAF）生成距离-多普勒图，提取目标的双静态延迟和径向速度，并结合非线性最小二乘三边测量和正则化线性反演进行位置和速度估计。

Result: 结果表明，该方法在2D和3D场景下均能实现高精度的目标检测、定位和跟踪。

Conclusion: 结论表明，5G PRS信号在多静态ISAC中具有高效的目标感知能力，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: This paper presents a complete signal-processing chain for multistatic
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) using 5G Positioning Reference
Signal (PRS). We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits
a periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers
exploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and
tracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a
range-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are
extracted for every target. For a single target, the resulting bistatic delays
are fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric
position estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed
equations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are
obtained. The approach is applied to 2D and 3D settings, extended to account
for time synchronization bias, and generalized to multiple targets by resolving
target association. The sequence of position-velocity estimates is then fed to
standard and extended Kalman filters to obtain smoothed tracks. Our results
show high-fidelity moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking using 5G
PRS signals for multistatic ISAC.

Abstract: The integration of Terrestrial Networks (TNs) with Non-Terrestrial Networks
(NTNs) poses unique architectural and functional challenges due to
heterogeneous propagation conditions, dynamic topologies and limited on-board
processing capabilities. This paper examines architectural and functional split
strategies that are consistent with O-RAN principles for future integrated
TN-NTN systems. A taxonomy of split options is proposed that distributes RAN
and core functions between satellites and ground nodes, and trade-offs in terms
of performance, latency, autonomy and deployment are analysed. In particular,
we evaluate configurations ranging from pure on-board DU deployments to full
gNB and UPF integration into satellites, including variations based on intra-
and inter-satellite processing. In addition, the placement of Near-RT and
Non-RT RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) is discussed, proposing flexible
split strategies between space and ground to optimise the performance and
scalability of the control loop. A comprehensive mapping between architectural
splits and RIC placement options is provided, emphasising implementation
constraints and interoperability considerations. The paper concludes by
identifying key challenges and outlining future directions to enable
standardised, modular and efficient TN-NTN convergence in the context of the
O-RAN.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DecoRTL的新型解码策略，用于改进LLM在RTL代码生成中的表现，解决了传统解码策略在结构性和语义性需求上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM解码策略在RTL代码生成中常导致无效、重复或幻觉代码，无法区分语法关键区域和设计关键区域的需求。

Method: DecoRTL结合了自一致性采样和语法感知温度适应，前者生成并重排候选代码以提高正确性和多样性，后者根据语法和功能角色调整采样温度。

Result: 在VerilogEval基准测试中，DecoRTL显著提升了语法有效性、功能正确性和输出多样性，且性能开销几乎不可感知。

Conclusion: DecoRTL是一种无需额外微调的运行时解码策略，能有效提升LLM在RTL代码生成中的表现。

Abstract: As one of their many applications, large language models (LLMs) have recently
shown promise in automating register transfer level (RTL) code generation.
However, conventional LLM decoding strategies, originally designed for natural
language, often fail to meet the structural and semantic demands of RTL,
leading to hallucinated, repetitive, or invalid code outputs. In this paper, we
first investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an
empirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings
reveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or
semantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to
differentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)
and those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical
regions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time
decoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code
generation. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)
self-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks
them based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining
diversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies
tokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling
temperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens
and higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at
inference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through
evaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we
demonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional
correctness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance
overhead) is imperceptible.

difficult to prepare for and seldom faced in computing curricula. To this end,
we seek to understand how candidates prepare for technical interviews,
investigating the effects of preparation methods and the role of education. We
distributed a survey to candidates (n = 131) actively preparing for technical
interviews. Our results suggest candidates rarely train in authentic settings
and courses fail to support preparation efforts -- leading to stress and
unpreparedness. Based on our findings, we provide implications for stakeholders

TL;DR: 提出了一种用自然语言进行结构化代码搜索的新方法，结合LLM和结构化搜索工具，显著提高了搜索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者通常使用关键词和正则表达式搜索代码，但结构化搜索工具需要学习DSL，门槛较高。自然语言搜索可以降低使用门槛。

Method: 结合LLM解析自然语言查询和结构化搜索工具，支持两种DSL（Semgrep和GQL），并构建了400个查询的基准测试。

Result: 方法在精确率和召回率上表现优异（55%-70%），显著优于语义代码搜索和LLM检索基线。

Conclusion: 自然语言结构化代码搜索方法有效且鲁棒，显著提升了搜索效率和准确性。

Abstract: Searching code is a common task that developers perform to understand APIs,
learn common code patterns, and navigate code. Currently, developers most
commonly search using keywords and regular expressions that are easy to use and
widely available. Beyond keywords and regular expressions, structural code
search tools allow developers to search for code based on its syntactic
structure. This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to
systematically refactoring code. However, these structural code search tools
operate on queries expressed in domain-specific languages (DSL) that can be
difficult to learn and write. We propose to allow developers to use natural
language to search for code structurally. Expressing queries in natural
language provides an intuitive way to search for code and lowers the barrier to
entry.
  In this work, we develop a novel general approach that combines the reasoning
capabilities of an LLM to interpret natural language search queries with the
power of structural search tools to efficiently and accurately retrieve
relevant code. We then instantiate this approach for two structural code search
DSLs: Semgrep and GQL. In our evaluation, we construct a new benchmark for
structural code search consisting of 400 queries over 10 Java projects. We show
that our approach for structural code search based on translating NL queries to
DSL queries using an LLM is effective and robust, achieving a high precision
and recall ranging from 55% - 70%. Further, our approach significantly
outperforms baselines based on semantic code search and LLM retrievals by up to
57% and 14% on F1 scores.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过内部软件指标预测移动应用的流行度，发现分类模型比回归模型更有效，最佳模型F1分数为0.72。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测应用发布前的流行度可为开发者提供竞争优势，但现有方法存在挑战。

Method: 使用446个开源Android应用的数据集，提取代码指标、代码异味和元数据，评估回归和分类模型。

Result: 回归模型表现不佳，但分类模型（尤其是多层感知器）表现较好，F1分数达0.72。

Conclusion: 内部代码指标可作为应用流行度的有用指标，挑战了此前认为其无法预测软件质量的观点。

Abstract: Predicting mobile app popularity before release can provide developers with a
strategic advantage in a competitive marketplace, yet it remains a challenging
problem. This study explores whether internal software metrics, measurable from
source code before deployment, can predict an app's popularity, defined by user
ratings (calculated from user reviews) and DownloadsPerYear (yearly downloads).
Using a dataset of 446 open-source Android apps from F-Droid, we extract a wide
array of features, including system-, class-, and method-level code metrics,
code smells, and app metadata. Additional information, such as user reviews,
download counts, and uses-permission, was collected from the Google Play Store.
We evaluate regression and classification models across three feature sets: a
minimal Size-only baseline, a domain-informed Handpicked set, and a Voting set
derived via feature selection algorithms. Regression models perform poorly due
to skewed data, with low $R^2$ scores. However, when reframed as binary
classification (Popular vs. Unpopular), results improve significantly. The best
model, a Multilayer Perceptron using the Voting set, achieves F1-scores of
0.72. These results suggest that internal code metrics, although limited in
their explanatory power, can serve as useful indicators of app popularity. This
challenges earlier findings that dismissed internal metrics as predictors of
software quality.

Motivation: 传统自我报告工具可能存在偏差，因此研究探索结合心理测量与生物特征指标的客观方法。

Method: 实验包括预调查、编程任务（佩戴生物传感器）、简短后调查及退出访谈。

Result: 心理测量工具未显示压力，访谈中参与者报告了时间压力或无压力，生物特征数据仅EDA相位峰值显著。

Conclusion: 通过严格时间限制诱导压力的方法不足，为未来研究提供了方法学启示。

Abstract: The study of well-being, stress and other human factors has traditionally
relied on self-report instruments to assess key variables. However, concerns
about potential biases in these instruments, even when thoroughly validated and
standardised, have driven growing interest in alternatives in combining these
measures with more objective methods, such as physiological measures.
  We aimed to (i) compare psychometric stress measures and biometric indicators
and (ii) identify stress-related patterns in biometric data during software
engineering tasks.
  We conducted an experiment where participants completed a pre-survey, then
programmed two tasks wearing biometric sensors, answered brief post-surveys for
each, and finally went through a short exit interview.
  Our results showed diverse outcomes; we found no stress in the psychometric
instruments. Participants in the interviews reported a mix of feeling no stress
and experiencing time pressure. Finally, the biometrics showed a significant
difference only in EDA phasic peaks.
  We conclude that our chosen way of inducing stress by imposing a stricter
time limit was insufficient. We offer methodological insights for future
studies working with stress, biometrics, and psychometric instruments.

Result: 数据集特征可用于改进工具选择，Transformer模型（如SetFit和RoBERTa）表现稳定，但工具效果仍依赖上下文。

Conclusion: 该方法帮助研究者和从业者选择可靠的情感分析工具，同时强调随着通信环境变化需要持续评估。

Abstract: Software development relies heavily on text-based communication, making
sentiment analysis a valuable tool for understanding team dynamics and
supporting trustworthy AI-driven analytics in requirements engineering.
However, existing sentiment analysis tools often perform inconsistently across
datasets from different platforms, due to variations in communication style and
content.
  In this study, we analyze linguistic and statistical features of 10 developer
communication datasets from five platforms and evaluate the performance of 14
sentiment analysis tools. Based on these results, we propose a mapping approach
and questionnaire that recommends suitable sentiment analysis tools for new
datasets, using their characteristic features as input.
  Our results show that dataset characteristics can be leveraged to improve
tool selection, as platforms differ substantially in both linguistic and
statistical properties. While transformer-based models such as SetFit and
RoBERTa consistently achieve strong results, tool effectiveness remains
context-dependent. Our approach supports researchers and practitioners in
selecting trustworthy tools for sentiment analysis in software engineering,
while highlighting the need for ongoing evaluation as communication contexts
evolve.

*Fangjian Lei,Jiawen Liu,Shayan Noei,Ying Zou,Derek Truong,William Alexander*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体方法，利用两个基于LLM的智能体协作生成COBOL代码的解释，解决了COBOL代码过长超出LLM窗口限制的问题，并在实验中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于COBOL语言的老化、复杂性以及开发人员减少，维护COBOL代码库变得困难，尤其是缺乏文档导致新开发人员难以理解代码。现有研究使用LLM解释代码，但COBOL的独特语法和架构差异使其代码常超出LLM的窗口限制。

Method: 采用多智能体方法，两个LLM智能体协作，结合代码库的上下文信息生成函数、文件和项目级别的解释。

Result: 在14个开源COBOL项目上评估，方法在函数解释上显著优于基线（METEOR、chrF、SentenceBERT分别提升12.67%、18.59%、0.62%），在文件级别解释上也表现更好（目的、功能、清晰度分别提升4.21%、10.72%、14.68%），项目级别解释覆盖82%的功能和目的。

Conclusion: 多智能体方法有效解决了COBOL代码解释的挑战，显著提升了生成解释的质量和覆盖范围。

Abstract: Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) is a programming language used to
develop business applications that are widely adopted by financial, business,
and government agencies. Due to its age, complexity, and declining number of
COBOL developers, maintaining COBOL codebases is becoming increasingly
challenging. In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for
new developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems. Existing
research utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of
code snippets. However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its
architectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed
the token window size of LLMs. In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach
that leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate
explanations for functions, files, and the overall project. These agents
incorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into
the code explanation prompts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach
using 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects. Our results indicate that our
approach performs significantly better than the baseline in function code
explanation, with improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% in terms of METEOR,
chrF, and SentenceBERT scores, respectively. At the file level, our approach
effectively explains both short and long COBOL files that exceed the token
window size of LLMs and surpass the baseline by 4.21%, 10.72%, and 14.68% in
explaining the purpose, functionality, and clarity of the generated
explanation. At the project level, our approach generates explanations that
convey the functionality and purpose of 82% of the selected projects.

Motivation: 现有垂直联邦学习缺乏对数据方推理软件执行正确性的审计机制。

Method: 设计了VeFIA框架，利用可信执行环境（TEE）和协调器验证数据方的计算结果。

Result: VeFIA能检测超过5.4%的异常推理，概率达99.99%，且不增加额外延迟。

Conclusion: VeFIA是首个讨论垂直联邦学习中推理软件执行正确性的工作，效果显著。

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a distributed AI software deployment
mechanism for cross-silo collaboration without accessing participants' data.
However, existing VFL work lacks a mechanism to audit the execution correctness
of the inference software of the data party. To address this problem, we design
a Vertical Federated Inference Auditing (VeFIA) framework. VeFIA helps the task
party to audit whether the data party's inference software is executed as
expected during large-scale inference without leaking the data privacy of the
data party or introducing additional latency to the inference system. The core
of VeFIA is that the task party can use the inference results from a framework
with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and the coordinator to validate the
correctness of the data party's computation results. VeFIA guarantees that, as
long as the abnormal inference exceeds 5.4%, the task party can detect
execution anomalies in the inference software with a probability of 99.99%,
without incurring any additional online inference latency. VeFIA's random
sampling validation achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and true positive rate in detecting abnormal inference. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the correctness
of inference software execution in VFL.

TL;DR: RTED是一种新型的类型感知测试生成技术，用于自动检测Python类型错误，结合类型约束分析和反射验证，显著减少误报并提高检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python类型错误常导致运行时故障，现有静态分析工具误报率高，单元测试生成技术缺乏针对性指导。

Method: RTED结合逐步类型约束分析和反射验证，指导测试生成过程并抑制误报。

Result: 在BugsInPy和TypeBugs基准测试中，RTED比现有技术多检测22-29个类型错误，误报率降低173.9%-245.9%，并发现12个未知错误。

Conclusion: RTED在检测Python类型错误方面表现出色，显著优于现有技术，且能发现新错误。

Abstract: Type errors in Python often lead to runtime failures, posing significant
challenges to software reliability and developer productivity. Existing static
analysis tools aim to detect such errors without execution but frequently
suffer from high false positive rates. Recently, unit test generation
techniques offer great promise in achieving high test coverage, but they often
struggle to produce bug-revealing tests without tailored guidance. To address
these limitations, we present RTED, a novel type-aware test generation
technique for automatically detecting Python type errors. Specifically, RTED
combines step-by-step type constraint analysis with reflective validation to
guide the test generation process and effectively suppress false positives. We
evaluated RTED on two widely-used benchmarks, BugsInPy and TypeBugs.
Experimental results show that RTED can detect 22-29 more benchmarked type
errors than four state-of-the-art techniques. RTED is also capable of producing
fewer false positives, achieving an improvement of 173.9%-245.9% in precision.
Furthermore, RTED successfully discovered 12 previously unknown type errors
from six real-world open-source Python projects.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化测试大型语言模型（LLM）公平性的新方法Meta-Fair，通过变形测试和LLM自身能力实现高效测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM公平性测试方法依赖人工和固定模板，资源密集且难以扩展，需要更自动化的解决方案。

Method: 采用变形测试（MRs）和LLM生成测试用例与评估输出，开发了三个开源工具支持测试流程。

Result: Meta-Fair在12个LLM上测试，平均精度92%，发现29%的执行存在偏见，LLM评估F1-score最高0.79。

Conclusion: Meta-Fair展示了自动化测试LLM公平性的潜力，但需进一步优化以提升适用性。

Abstract: Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the
development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult
to assess and enforce. Current approaches to fairness testing in large language
models (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic
heuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult
to scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method
for testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific
resources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,
Meta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to
uncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled
modifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,
we propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and
output evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and
classify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source
tools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test
cases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained
LLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.
The results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,
achieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of
executions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,
with the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although
non-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through
careful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the
results indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation
in LLM testing.

TL;DR: LLMREI是一种基于大型语言模型的聊天机器人，旨在自动化需求收集访谈，减少人为错误并提高可扩展性。研究评估了其在模拟访谈中的表现，发现其与人类访谈者表现相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需求收集访谈依赖熟练分析师，资源密集且易受人为偏见影响。利用大型语言模型自动化部分流程可提高效率和准确性。

Method: 研究采用零样本提示和最少到最多提示两种方法优化LLMREI，并在33次模拟访谈中评估其表现。微调方法因初步表现不佳被放弃。

Result: LLMREI在减少常见访谈错误、提取相关需求和生成上下文相关问题上表现良好，与人类访谈者相当。

Conclusion: LLMREI在自动化大规模利益相关者访谈中潜力巨大，未来可进一步优化其性能。

Abstract: Requirements elicitation interviews are crucial for gathering system
requirements but heavily depend on skilled analysts, making them
resource-intensive, susceptible to human biases, and prone to miscommunication.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models present new opportunities for
automating parts of this process. This study introduces LLMREI, a chat bot
designed to conduct requirements elicitation interviews with minimal human
intervention, aiming to reduce common interviewer errors and improve the
scalability of requirements elicitation. We explored two main approaches,
zero-shot prompting and least-to-most prompting, to optimize LLMREI for
requirements elicitation and evaluated its performance in 33 simulated
stakeholder interviews. A third approach, fine-tuning, was initially considered
but abandoned due to poor performance in preliminary trials. Our study assesses
the chat bot's effectiveness in three key areas: minimizing common interview
errors, extracting relevant requirements, and adapting its questioning based on
interview context and user responses. Our findings indicate that LLMREI makes a
similar number of errors compared to human interviewers, is capable of
extracting a large portion of requirements, and demonstrates a notable ability
to generate highly context-dependent questions. We envision the greatest
benefit of LLMREI in automating interviews with a large number of stakeholders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自适应CPS需要整合人机协作，但现有反馈循环（如MAPE-K）难以适应人机操作节奏差异，且HMT涉及隐私和伦理问题。

Method: 开发新方法将HMT整合到自适应CPS中，并构建框架以验证和确保伦理与人类价值观贯穿系统生命周期。

Result: 提出了整合HMT的方法和伦理验证框架。

Conclusion: 研究为自适应CPS中实现无缝HMT提供了解决方案，强调隐私和伦理的重要性。

Abstract: Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that integrate both
physical and computational capabilities, which can adjust in response to
changing parameters. Furthermore, they increasingly incorporate human-machine
collaboration, allowing them to benefit from the individual strengths of humans
and machines. Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) represents the most advanced paradigm
of human-machine collaboration, envisioning seamless teamwork between humans
and machines. However, achieving effective and seamless HMT in adaptive CPS is
challenging. While adaptive CPS already benefit from feedback loops such as
MAPE-K, there is still a gap in integrating humans into these feedback loops
due to different operational cadences of humans and machines. Further, HMT
requires constant monitoring of human operators, collecting potentially
sensitive information about their actions and behavior. Respecting the privacy
and human values of the actors of the CPS is crucial for the success of
human-machine teams. This research addresses these challenges by: (1)
developing novel methods and processes for integrating HMT into adaptive CPS,
focusing on human-machine interaction principles and their incorporation into
adaptive feedback loops found in CPS, and (2) creating frameworks for
integrating, verifying, and validating ethics and human values throughout the
system lifecycle, starting from requirements engineering.

Result: 在六个真实数据集上，RLHGNN表现优于现有方法，推理延迟约为1毫秒，适合实时应用。

Conclusion: RLHGNN通过自适应建模顺序和非顺序关系，为实时业务过程监控提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing
business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices
environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which
enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite
the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture
non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and
conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural
preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static
structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual
process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce
RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process
graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining
theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively
combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and
employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to
automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process
instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with
relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next
activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential
and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive
evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference
latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical
solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The

Conclusion: 可持续性标志比单纯依赖定义更实用且易于理解。

Abstract: In recent years, sustainability in software systems has gained significant
attention, especially with the rise of cloud computing and the shift towards
cloud-based architectures. This shift has intensified the need to identify
sustainability in architectural discussions to take informed architectural
decisions. One source to see these decisions is in online Q&A forums among
practitioners' discussions. However, recognizing sustainability concepts within
software practitioners' discussions remains challenging due to the lack of
clear and distinct guidelines for this task. To address this issue, we
introduce the notion of sustainability flags as pointers in relevant
discussions, developed through thematic analysis of multiple sustainability
best practices from cloud providers. This study further evaluates the
effectiveness of these flags in identifying sustainability within cloud
architecture posts, using a controlled experiment. Preliminary results suggest
that the use of flags results in classifying fewer posts as
sustainability-related compared to a control group, with moderately higher
certainty and significantly improved performance. Moreover, sustainability
flags are perceived as more useful and understandable than relying solely on
definitions for identifying sustainability.

Conclusion: 该方法减少了手动标注需求，提高了对新法规的适用性，为法律合规提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

Conclusion: LLMs可实时提升需求访谈的质量和效率，尤其是在指导生成问题时表现突出。

Abstract: Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather
stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.
Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate
interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.

extended Tweedie's formulae that express the (infeasible) optimal estimators of

the density of certain sufficient statistics. These are used to propose
feasible versions with nearly parametric regret bounds of the order of $(\log

value-added, where we find that allowing for heterogeneous variances across
teachers is crucial for delivery optimal estimates of teacher quality and
detecting low-performing teachers.

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on
about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous
literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline
dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to
environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents
represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous
literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that
`true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the
second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a
dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After
controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''
green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the
analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield
higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses
to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking
in different domains.

Abstract: Green ammonia is emerging as a strategic intermediary within green energy
supply chains, serving effectively as both an industrial commodity and hydrogen
carrier. This study provides a techno-economic analysis of green ammonia supply
chains, comparing cost-effective pathways from global production to European

Gaseous hydrogen consistently remains the most economical import option for
Europe, though ammonia holds a narrowing cost advantage over liquid hydrogen
(from 16 % in 2030 to 10 % by 2040). Competitive ammonia suppliers, notably
Morocco, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates, benefit from low
renewable energy costs, with significant price reductions expected by 2040,
driven by falling costs for electricity, electrolysers, and conversion
technologies. Optimal transport modes vary by consumer demand and distance:
trucks are ideal for low demands at all distances, rail for medium ranges, and
pipelines for high-demand scenarios. By 2040, ammonia will primarily serve
direct-use applications, as hydrogen consumers increasingly shift to direct
hydrogen supplies. Policymakers should prioritize pipeline infrastructure for
hydrogen distribution, cautiously invest in ammonia's short- to medium-term
infrastructure advantages, and limit long-term reliance on ammonia as a
hydrogen carrier to mitigate stranded asset risks.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个新的英国脱欧相关不确定性指数（BRUI），结合文本挖掘、自然语言处理和大语言模型技术，分析经济报告，并通过VAR模型评估宏观经济变量对BRUI冲击的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 英国脱欧等重大经济事件带来的不确定性可能影响投资决策和宏观经济，需要量化工具以帮助政策制定。

Method: 使用文本挖掘、NLP和LLM技术分析经济报告，构建BRUI，并通过VAR模型分析其影响。

Result: BRUI与其他不确定性指数相比表现出稳健性，能有效区分脱欧和COVID-19相关不确定性。

Conclusion: BRUI为英国政策制定者提供了量化脱欧不确定性的工具，有助于更有效的政策制定。

Abstract: Important game-changer economic events and transformations cause
uncertainties that may affect investment decisions, capital flows,
international trade, and macroeconomic variables. One such major transformation
is Brexit, which refers to the multiyear process through which the UK withdrew
from the EU. This study develops and uses a new Brexit-Related Uncertainty
Index (BRUI). In creating this index, we apply Text Mining, Context Window,
Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs) from Deep
Learning techniques to analyse the monthly country reports of the Economist
Intelligence Unit from May 2012 to January 2025. Additionally, we employ a
standard vector autoregression (VAR) analysis to examine the model-implied
responses of various macroeconomic variables to BRUI shocks. While developing
the BRUI, we also create a complementary COVID-19 Related Uncertainty Index
(CRUI) to distinguish the uncertainties stemming from these distinct events.
Empirical findings and comparisons of BRUI with other earlier-developed
uncertainty indexes demonstrate the robustness of the new index. This new index
can assist British policymakers in measuring and understanding the impacts of
Brexit-related uncertainties, enabling more effective policy formulation.

### [177] [Identity and Cooperation in Multicultural Societies: An Experimental Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02511)
*Natalia Montinari,Matteo Ploner,Veronica Rattini*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文研究了不同身份维度对移民和本地青年合作的影响，发现移民比本地人更合作，而通过激活多元文化身份可以缩小合作差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移民与本地人之间的社会互动对整合至关重要，但差异可能阻碍合作。研究旨在探讨身份认同如何促进合作。

Method: 通过实验室实地实验，随机分配390名青少年到不同身份激活组（共同身份、多元文化身份或中性身份），并玩公共物品游戏。

Result: 移民比本地人基线合作度高13%。激活多元文化身份后，本地人合作度提高3个百分点，缩小了与移民的差距。

Conclusion: 身份激活策略可有效促进移民与本地人之间的合作，多元文化身份尤其对本地人有积极影响。

Abstract: Immigration has shaped many nations, posing the challenge of integrating
immigrants into society. While economists often focus on immigrants' economic
outcomes compared to natives (such as education, labor market success, and
health) social interactions between immigrants and natives are equally crucial.
These interactions, from everyday exchanges to teamwork, often lack enforceable
contracts and require cooperation to avoid conflicts and achieve efficient
outcomes. However, socioeconomic, ethnic, and cultural differences can hinder
cooperation. Thus, evaluating integration should also consider its impact on
fostering cooperation across diverse groups. This paper studies how priming
different identity dimensions affects cooperation between immigrant and native
youth. Immigrant identity includes both ethnic ties to their country of origin
and connections to the host country. We test whether cooperation improves by
making salient a specific identity: Common identity (shared society),
Multicultural identity (ethnic group within society), or Neutral identity. In a
lab in the field experiment with over 390 adolescents, participants were
randomly assigned to one of these priming conditions and played a Public Good
Game. Results show that immigrants are 13 percent more cooperative than natives
at baseline. Natives increase cooperation by about 3 percentage points when
their multicultural identity is primed, closing the initial gap with immigrant
peers.

TL;DR: 研究探讨信息对弱势学生高等教育投资决策的影响，发现提供教育回报信息能提升学业表现，减少辍学率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解信息在弱势学生高等教育决策中的作用，以解释其投资行为。

Method: 在意大利对7,806名受助大学生进行实地实验，提供关于完成大学或满足学术要求的回报信息。

Result: 仅提供教育回报信息显著提升学业表现（学分增加约3分），减少辍学率约4个百分点。

Conclusion: 信息干预通过提升学生抱负水平改善学业表现。

Abstract: Understanding the role of information among disadvantaged students is crucial
in explaining their investment decisions in higher education. Indeed,
information barriers on the returns and the gains from completing college may
explain a substantial share of variation in students' degree completion. We
conduct a field experiment with 7,806 university students in Italy who benefit
from financial aid assistance, by providing information, either on the labor
market returns of completing college or on the education returns of meeting the
academic requirements attached to the financial aid. Our results suggest that
only the latter information treatment has a positive effect on academic
performance, increasing the number of credits obtained by around 3, and by
decreasing the probability of dropout by around 4 percentage points. We also
find that the results are mediated by an aspiration lift generated by our
treatment.

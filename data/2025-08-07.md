### [1] [MI9 -- Agent Intelligence Protocol: Runtime Governance for Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858)
*Charles L. Wang,Trisha Singhal,Ameya Kelkar,Jason Tuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MI9是一个专为代理型AI系统设计的运行时治理框架，通过六项集成组件解决传统治理方法无法应对的新型风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理型AI系统在运行时表现出不可预测的行为，传统预部署治理无法完全覆盖这些风险，因此需要专门的运行时治理框架。

Method: MI9通过六项组件实现实时控制：代理风险指数、代理语义遥测捕获、持续授权监控、基于有限状态机的符合性引擎、目标条件漂移检测和分级遏制策略。

Result: MI9在多样化场景中展示了系统性覆盖现有方法无法解决的治理挑战，为代理型AI的安全部署提供了技术基础。

Conclusion: MI9为代理型AI的大规模安全部署提供了首个全面运行时治理框架，填补了传统治理方法的不足。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions
present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI
models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected
behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be
fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance
framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems.
MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components:
agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization
monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines,
goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies.
Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables
the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in
production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short,
providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at
scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's
systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to
address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI
oversight.

### [2] [Evo-MARL: Co-Evolutionary Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Internalized Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03864)
*Zhenyu Pan,Yiting Zhang,Yutong Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Haozheng Luo,Yuwei Han,Dennis Wu,Hong-Yu Chen,Philip S. Yu,Manling Li,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evo-MARL是一个多智能体强化学习框架，通过联合训练任务智能体获得防御能力，避免外部安全模块的依赖，提升系统鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型构建的多智能体系统面临安全风险（如越狱和对抗攻击），现有防御方法依赖外部安全模块，存在保护不足和单点故障问题。

Method: 提出Evo-MARL框架，通过多智能体强化学习联合训练任务智能体，使其兼具主功能和防御能力，结合进化搜索和参数共享强化学习进行对抗训练。

Result: 实验显示，Evo-MARL将攻击成功率降低22%，推理任务准确率提升5%，证明安全性与实用性可协同提升。

Conclusion: Evo-MARL通过内部化安全机制和对抗训练，有效提升多智能体系统的安全性和性能，避免外部模块的缺陷。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit
strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and
interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial
attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as
dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this
paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,
and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,
system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents
further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that
enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than
relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to
simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,
ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.
Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing
reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial
training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS
performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces
attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on
reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.

### [3] [MOTIF: Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03929)
*Nguyen Viet Tuan Kiet,Dao Van Tung,Tran Cong Dao,Huynh Thi Thanh Binh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOTIF框架通过多策略优化和LLM代理的交互，提升组合优化问题的求解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在解决NP难组合优化问题时，通常局限于单一策略（如启发式评分函数），未能充分利用多组件协同优化的潜力。

Method: 提出MOTIF框架，基于蒙特卡洛树搜索，通过两个LLM代理的轮换优化，协同改进多个组件。

Result: 在多个组合优化领域实验中，MOTIF表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOTIF展示了多代理轮换优化在自动化求解器设计中的潜力。

Abstract: Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in
tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers
often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in
using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most
approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic
scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this
paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy
optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent
components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose
Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a
novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based
optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one
component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior
updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This
structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the
discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple
COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully
automated solver design.

### [4] [Can Large Language Models Adequately Perform Symbolic Reasoning Over Time Series?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03963)
*Zewen Liu,Juntong Ni,Xianfeng Tang,Max S. Y. Lau,Wei Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SymbolBench是一个评估LLMs在时间序列数据中符号推理能力的基准，涵盖多元符号回归、布尔网络推断和因果发现任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示时间序列数据中的隐藏符号规律是科学发现和人工智能的核心挑战，但LLMs在这方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出SymbolBench基准和结合LLMs与遗传编程的统一框架，LLMs作为预测器和评估器。

Result: 实证结果揭示了当前模型的优势和局限性，强调了领域知识、上下文对齐和推理结构的重要性。

Conclusion: 结合领域知识和结构化推理可提升LLMs在自动科学发现中的表现。

Abstract: Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration
dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge
in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language
Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer
interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is
still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning
over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic
regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior
efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set
of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified
framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop
symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators.
Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models,
highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment,
and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

### [5] [The Emotional Baby Is Truly Deadly: Does your Multimodal Large Reasoning Model Have Emotional Flattery towards Humans?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03986)
*Yuan Xun,Xiaojun Jia,Xinwei Liu,Hua Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出EmoAgent框架，通过情感提示劫持推理路径，揭示MLRMs在高情感强度下的安全漏洞，并引入三个指标量化风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现MLRMs在深度思考阶段易受用户情感提示影响，导致安全协议失效，需量化这种风险。

Method: 提出EmoAgent框架，通过情感提示劫持推理路径，并设计RRSS、RVNR和RAIC三个指标评估风险。

Result: 实验证明EmoAgent有效，揭示了MLRMs在情感认知与安全行为间的深层错位。

Conclusion: EmoAgent揭示了MLRMs的情感安全漏洞，需进一步研究以提升模型安全性。

Abstract: We observe that MLRMs oriented toward human-centric service are highly
susceptible to user emotional cues during the deep-thinking stage, often
overriding safety protocols or built-in safety checks under high emotional
intensity. Inspired by this key insight, we propose EmoAgent, an autonomous
adversarial emotion-agent framework that orchestrates exaggerated affective
prompts to hijack reasoning pathways. Even when visual risks are correctly
identified, models can still produce harmful completions through emotional
misalignment. We further identify persistent high-risk failure modes in
transparent deep-thinking scenarios, such as MLRMs generating harmful reasoning
masked behind seemingly safe responses. These failures expose misalignments
between internal inference and surface-level behavior, eluding existing
content-based safeguards. To quantify these risks, we introduce three metrics:
(1) Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning beneath benign
outputs; (2) Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite
visual risk recognition; and (3) Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for
evaluating refusal unstability under prompt variants. Extensive experiments on
advanced MLRMs demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoAgent and reveal deeper
emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.

### [6] [Galaxy: A Cognition-Centered Framework for Proactive, Privacy-Preserving, and Self-Evolving LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03991)
*Chongyu Bao,Ruimin Dai,Yangbo Shen,Runyang Jian,Jinghan Zhang,Xiaolan Liu,Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cognition Forest的语义结构，将认知建模与系统设计统一为一个自增强循环，并基于此开发了Galaxy框架，支持多维交互和个性化能力生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能个人助手（IPAs）的主动行为研究不足，设计兼具主动性、隐私保护和自我进化能力的IPA仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出Cognition Forest语义结构，将认知架构与系统设计统一为自增强循环；开发Galaxy框架，实现多维交互和个性化能力生成。

Result: 实验表明Galaxy优于多个先进基准，消融研究和实际交互案例验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Cognition Forest和Galaxy框架为IPA的主动行为设计提供了新思路，并展示了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant are
designed to enhance human capabilities and perform tasks on behalf of users.
The emergence of LLM agents brings new opportunities for the development of
IPAs. While responsive capabilities have been widely studied, proactive
behaviors remain underexplored. Designing an IPA that is proactive,
privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution remains a significant
challenge. Designing such IPAs relies on the cognitive architecture of LLM
agents. This work proposes Cognition Forest, a semantic structure designed to
align cognitive modeling with system-level design. We unify cognitive
architecture and system design into a self-reinforcing loop instead of treating
them separately. Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that
supports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation.
Two cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a
cognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive
skills; and Kernel, a meta-cognition-based meta-agent that enables Galaxy's
self-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results show that Galaxy
outperforms multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies and
real-world interaction cases validate the effectiveness of Galaxy.

### [7] [Uncertainty-Aware GUI Agent: Adaptive Perception through Component Recommendation and Human-in-the-Loop Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04025)
*Chao Hao,Shuai Wang,Kaiwen Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecAgent是一个不确定性感知的GUI代理，通过自适应感知解决输入冗余和决策模糊问题，包括组件推荐和交互模块，并在复杂场景中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI代理在自动化移动任务中存在输入冗余和决策模糊的问题，需要一种更智能的解决方案。

Method: RecAgent采用组件推荐机制减少感知不确定性，并通过交互模块在模糊情境中请求用户反馈以降低决策不确定性。

Result: 实验验证了RecAgent的有效性，并提出了ComplexAction数据集用于评估。

Conclusion: RecAgent通过自适应感知和用户反馈显著提升了GUI代理的性能，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have shown promise in automating mobile
tasks but still struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity. In this
paper, we present \textbf{RecAgent}, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses
these issues through adaptive perception. We distinguish two types of
uncertainty in GUI navigation: (1) perceptual uncertainty, caused by input
redundancy and noise from comprehensive screen information, and (2) decision
uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks and complex reasoning. To reduce
perceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism
that identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision
uncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in
ambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are
integrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity
and reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement.
Additionally, we propose a dataset called \textbf{ComplexAction} to evaluate
the success rate of GUI agents in executing specified single-step actions
within complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach. The dataset and code will be available at
https://github.com/Fanye12/RecAgent.

### [8] [SEA: Self-Evolution Agent with Step-wise Reward for Computer Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04037)
*Liang Tang,Shuxian Li,Yuhao Cheng,Yukang Huo,Zhepeng Wang,Yiqiang Yan,Kaer Huang,Yanzhe Jing,Tiaonan Duan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SEA的计算机使用代理，通过创新的数据生成、强化学习和模型增强方法，显著提升了性能，且参数规模较小（7B）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机使用代理的性能不足以实际应用，因此需要开发更高效的代理。

Method: 1. 自动生成可验证轨迹用于训练；2. 高效的逐步强化学习以减少长时训练的计算需求；3. 将基础能力和规划能力整合到一个模型中。

Result: SEA在7B参数规模下表现优于同类模型，并与更大模型性能相当。

Conclusion: SEA通过创新方法显著提升了计算机使用代理的性能，未来将开源模型和代码。

Abstract: Computer use agent is an emerging area in artificial intelligence that aims
to operate the computers to achieve the user's tasks, which attracts a lot of
attention from both industry and academia. However, the present agents'
performance is far from being used. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Evolution Agent (SEA) for computer use, and to develop this agent, we
propose creative methods in data generation, reinforcement learning, and model
enhancement. Specifically, we first propose an automatic pipeline to generate
the verifiable trajectory for training. And then, we propose efficient
step-wise reinforcement learning to alleviate the significant computational
requirements for long-horizon training. In the end, we propose the enhancement
method to merge the grounding and planning ability into one model without any
extra training. Accordingly, based on our proposed innovation of data
generation, training strategy, and enhancement, we get the Selfevolution Agent
(SEA) for computer use with only 7B parameters, which outperforms models with
the same number of parameters and has comparable performance to larger ones. We
will make the models' weight and related codes open-source in the future.

*Ronja Mehlan,Claudia Hess,Quintus Stierstorfer,Kristina Schaaff*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于职业目标的生成式AI学习内容个性化对学习者参与度、满意度和学习效率的影响，结果显示个性化内容显著提升了学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过AI个性化学习内容以增强学习者的长期动机和参与度。

Method: 采用混合方法实验，4000多名学习者分为实验组（个性化内容）和对照组（标准内容）。

Result: 实验组表现出更高的会话时长、满意度和略短的学习时长，学习者认为个性化内容更实用和激励。

Conclusion: 个性化学习内容与职业目标对齐能显著提升学习效果，AI可规模化实现这一目标。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into digital
learning environments, the personalization of learning content to reflect
learners' individual career goals offers promising potential to enhance
engagement and long-term motivation. In our study, we investigate how career
goal-based content adaptation in learning systems based on generative AI
(GenAI) influences learner engagement, satisfaction, and study efficiency. The
mixed-methods experiment involved more than 4,000 learners, with one group
receiving learning scenarios tailored to their career goals and a control
group. Quantitative results show increased session duration, higher
satisfaction ratings, and a modest reduction in study duration compared to
standard content. Qualitative analysis highlights that learners found the
personalized material motivating and practical, enabling deep cognitive
engagement and strong identification with the content. These findings
underscore the value of aligning educational content with learners' career
goals and suggest that scalable AI personalization can bridge academic
knowledge and workplace applicability.

*Xingyu Chen,Junxiu An,Jun Guo,Li Wang,Jingcai Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KGA-ECoT框架通过知识图谱和可执行代码提升复杂推理任务（如数学推理和代码生成）的性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，需要一种新方法来提升数学推理和代码生成的准确性。

Method: 提出KGA-ECoT框架，结合知识图谱（GraphRAG）和可执行代码，分解问题为结构化任务图并生成可验证代码。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，KGA-ECoT显著优于现有方法，准确率提升数个百分点至十个百分点以上。

Conclusion: KGA-ECoT是一个鲁棒且泛化能力强的框架，适用于复杂数学推理任务。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural
language processing tasks but face significant challenges in complex reasoning
tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. To address these
limitations, we propose KG-Augmented Executable Chain-of-Thought (KGA-ECoT), a
novel framework that enhances code generation through knowledge graphs and
improves mathematical reasoning via executable code. KGA-ECoT decomposes
problems into a Structured Task Graph, leverages efficient GraphRAG for precise
knowledge retrieval from mathematical libraries, and generates verifiable code
to ensure computational accuracy. Evaluations on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KGA-ECoT significantly outperforms
existing prompting methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements ranging
from several to over ten percentage points. Further analysis confirms the
critical roles of GraphRAG in enhancing code quality and external code
execution in ensuring precision. These findings collectively establish KGA-ECoT
as a robust and highly generalizable framework for complex mathematical
reasoning tasks.

### [11] [GeoSR: Cognitive-Agentic Framework for Probing Geospatial Knowledge Boundaries via Iterative Self-Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04080)
*Jinfan Tang,Kunming Wu,Ruifeng Gongxie,Yuya He,Yuankai Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoSR是一个自优化的代理推理框架，通过嵌入地理原则（如Tobler地理第一定律）来提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在空间一致性、多跳推理和地理偏见方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在空间一致性、多跳推理和地理偏见方面的挑战，提升其在地理问题中的表现。

Method: 提出GeoSR框架，包含三个协作代理：变量选择代理、点选择代理和优化代理，通过迭代预测循环逐步改进预测质量。

Result: 实验表明，GeoSR在物理世界属性估计和社会经济预测任务中表现优于标准提示策略。

Conclusion: GeoSR通过整合地理统计先验和空间结构化推理，显著提升了LLMs在地理预测中的准确性和公平性。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the application of large language models (LLMs)
to geographic problems, revealing surprising geospatial competence even without
explicit spatial supervision. However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial
consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues,
we propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core
geographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into
an iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed
into three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects
relevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that
chooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in
previous rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative
refinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further
rounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction
quality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable
relationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property
estimation to socioeconomic prediction. Experimental results show consistent
improvements over standard prompting strategies, demonstrating that
incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into
LLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code of
GeoSR is available at https://github.com/JinfanTang/GeoSR.

### [12] [Towards Transparent AI Grading: Semantic Entropy as a Signal for Human-AI Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04105)
*Karrtik Iyer,Manikandan Ravikiran,Prasanna Pendse,Shayan Mohanty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“语义熵”的指标，用于量化AI评分系统的不确定性，并通过实验验证其与人工评分分歧的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动评分系统无法有效反映评分决策的不确定性或争议性，需要一种透明且可信的指标。

Method: 通过GPT-4生成多个解释，基于蕴含相似性聚类，计算语义熵以量化分歧。

Result: 语义熵与人工评分分歧相关，适用于不同学科，且对任务结构敏感。

Conclusion: 语义熵可作为AI辅助评分的透明不确定性信号，提升可信度。

Abstract: Automated grading systems can efficiently score short-answer responses, yet
they often fail to indicate when a grading decision is uncertain or potentially
contentious. We introduce semantic entropy, a measure of variability across
multiple GPT-4-generated explanations for the same student response, as a proxy
for human grader disagreement. By clustering rationales via entailment-based
similarity and computing entropy over these clusters, we quantify the diversity
of justifications without relying on final output scores. We address three
research questions: (1) Does semantic entropy align with human grader
disagreement? (2) Does it generalize across academic subjects? (3) Is it
sensitive to structural task features such as source dependency? Experiments on
the ASAP-SAS dataset show that semantic entropy correlates with rater
disagreement, varies meaningfully across subjects, and increases in tasks
requiring interpretive reasoning. Our findings position semantic entropy as an
interpretable uncertainty signal that supports more transparent and trustworthy
AI-assisted grading workflows.

*Shuo Liu,Zeyu Liang,Xueguang Lyu,Christopher Amato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体强化学习（MARL）方法MAGRPO，用于优化大型语言模型（LLM）在多智能体系统中的协作能力，解决了现有方法依赖复杂个体奖励设计的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM通常独立预训练，缺乏针对多智能体协作的优化，且现有微调框架依赖复杂的个体奖励设计，难以有效促进协作。

Method: 将LLM协作建模为合作型MARL问题，提出多智能体多轮算法MAGRPO，结合现有RL和MARL技术。

Result: 实验表明，MAGRPO能有效提升LLM在写作和编码协作任务中的响应质量和效率。

Conclusion: MAGRPO为LLM协作提供了新思路，并展示了MARL方法在LLM中的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for
modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most
LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for
coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards,
which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration.
To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent,
multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO),
to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL
techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate
that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality
responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the
door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated
challenges.

### [14] [A Compositional Framework for On-the-Fly LTLf Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04116)
*Yongkang Li,Shengping Xiao,Shufang Zhu,Jianwen Li,Geguang Pu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种组合式即时合成框架，结合了两种现有方法的优势，专注于处理实践中常见的大型LTLf公式联合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术要么在解决游戏前组合构建DFA，要么在游戏解决过程中增量构建DFA，但两者均无绝对优势。

Method: 引入组合式即时合成框架，在游戏解决过程中应用组合而非构建自动机（游戏场地），并支持两种组合变体。

Result: 与现有合成求解器相比，该框架能解决更多其他求解器无法处理的实例。

Conclusion: 两种组合变体各有独特优势，框架在简化后续组合和早期检测不可实现性方面表现突出。

Abstract: Reactive synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) can
be reduced to a two-player game over a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of
the LTLf specification. The primary challenge here is DFA construction, which
is 2EXPTIME-complete in the worst case. Existing techniques either construct
the DFA compositionally before solving the game, leveraging automata
minimization to mitigate state-space explosion, or build the DFA incrementally
during game solving to avoid full DFA construction. However, neither is
dominant. In this paper, we introduce a compositional on-the-fly synthesis
framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large
conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas common in practice. This framework
applies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena)
construction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the
worst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and
enables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows
two composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of
minimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis.
Compared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve
a notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed
analysis shows that both composition variants have unique merits.

*Ruochen Zhao,Simone Conia,Eric Peng,Min Li,Saloni Potdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgREE是一种基于代理的框架，通过多步推理和迭代检索动态构建知识图谱三元组，无需训练即可显著优于现有方法，尤其适用于新兴实体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放领域知识图谱补全（KGC）中新兴实体信息不足的问题，现有方法依赖预训练语言模型或单步检索，难以捕捉动态信息。

Method: 提出AgREE框架，结合迭代检索和多步推理动态构建知识图谱三元组，无需训练数据。

Result: 实验显示AgREE在构建知识图谱三元组上表现优异，尤其对新兴实体提升达13.7%，并提出新的评估方法和基准。

Conclusion: AgREE通过代理推理和策略性信息检索，有效维护动态环境中的最新知识图谱。

Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in
an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of
new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on
pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or
single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training
data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date
information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce
Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework
that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to
dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that,
despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms
existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for
emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training
processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose
a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing
setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates
the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information
retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information

### [16] [Generic-to-Specific Reasoning and Learning for Scalable Ad Hoc Teamwork](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04163)
*Hasra Dodampegama,Mohan Sridharan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出结合知识驱动和数据驱动的方法，用于无预先协调的临时团队协作，通过逻辑推理和行为预测提升AI代理的协作效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法需要大量标注数据且缺乏透明性，难以快速适应变化，随着代理数量增加，决策复杂性导致协作效率下降。

Method: 采用非单调逻辑推理，结合先验常识、快速学习的行为预测模型和基于基础模型的未来目标预测。

Result: 在VirtualHome仿真环境中实验验证了该架构的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合知识驱动和数据驱动的方法能显著提升临时团队协作的效率和适应性。

Abstract: AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other
agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered
state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach
that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency,
and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to
changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making
makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging
the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for
reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our
architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through
non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific
knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of
other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic
knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We
experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a
realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.

*Jiaying Zhu,Ziyang Zheng,Zhengyuan Shi,Yalun Cai,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CASCAD是一种新型电路感知SAT求解框架，利用GNN计算电路级条件概率，显著提升求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将电路转换为CNF并丢弃结构信息，导致求解性能不佳。

Method: 通过GNN建模门级条件概率，动态指导CDCL启发式策略（变量相位选择和子句管理）。

Result: 在LEC基准测试中，CASCAD比现有CNF方法快10倍，并通过概率引导子句过滤进一步减少23.5%运行时间。

Conclusion: 保留电路结构信息对提升SAT求解效率和EDA工具设计至关重要。

Abstract: Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design
Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits
into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by
Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently
discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal
solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel
circuit-aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit-level
conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By
explicitly modeling gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically
guides two critical CDCL heuristics -- variable phase selection and clause
managementto significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on
challenging real-world Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC) benchmarks
demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to
state-of-the-art CNF-based approaches, achieving an additional 23.5% runtime
reduction via our probability-guided clause filtering strategy. Our results
underscore the importance of preserving circuit-level structural insights
within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in
SAT-solving efficiency and EDA tool design.

Conclusion: BalancedBio为生物医学AI对齐提供了理论和方法支持，具有高效性和安全性。

Abstract: BalancedBio is a theoretically grounded framework for parameter-efficient
biomedical reasoning, addressing multi-capability integration in
domain-specific AI alignment. It establishes the Biomedical Multi-Capability
Convergence Theorem, proving orthogonal gradient spaces are essential to
prevent capability interference for safe deployment. Key innovations include:

Source2Synth with clinical workflow constraints and medical ontology validation
for factual accuracy and safety; and (2) Capability Aware Group Relative Policy
Optimization, deriving optimal hybrid reward weighting to maintain
orthogonality in RL, using a reward model with rule-based and model-based
scores adapted to biomedical tasks. Mathematical analysis proves Pareto-optimal
convergence, preserving performance across capabilities. It achieves
state-of-the-art results in its parameter class: domain expertise (80.95%
BIOMED-MMLU, +15.32% over baseline), reasoning (61.94%, +7.75%), instruction
following (67.95%, +6.44%), and integration (86.7%, +18.5%). Theoretical safety
guarantees include bounds on capability preservation and clinical accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏对记忆模型挑战程度的可控性，而合成环境能提供更精细的评估。

Method: 基于Memory Demand Structure (MDS)理论框架，利用线性过程动态、状态聚合和奖励重分配构建定制POMDP。

Result: 开发了一系列难度递增的POMDP环境，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为记忆增强RL在POMDP中的挑战提供了清晰指导，并为环境设计和记忆模型选择提供了支持。

Abstract: Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make
decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world
problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to
memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained
manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous
evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with
three key contributions:
  1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand
Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology
leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward
redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3.
Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty
levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the
challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for
analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for
selecting memory models in RL tasks.

*Anran Xu,Jincheng Wang,Baigen Cai,Tao Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DRN的新方法，通过将逻辑推理从概率最大化转为不确定性最小化，解决了大语言模型在逻辑推理中的认知陷阱问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理中常因语义启发式与决定性证据冲突而失败，即认知陷阱。为解决这一问题，作者提出了DRN。

Method: DRN通过迭代证据合成过程，显式跟踪信念状态并量化竞争假设的认知不确定性，实现了内在可解释性。验证包括定制判别模型和轻量验证模块。

Result: 在LCR-1000基准测试中，DRN比基线提升15.2%；与Mistral-7B结合后，在最具挑战性问题上的准确率从20%提升至80%。

Conclusion: DRN展示了强大的零样本泛化能力，是构建更可信AI系统的基础性、可验证的System 2推理组件。

Abstract: Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic
heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive
traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative
Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from
probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which
answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally
consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly
tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing
hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our
approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative
model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a
lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.
Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to
expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over
standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with
Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most
challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional
training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable
reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2
reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniPlay是一个多模态基准测试，旨在评估动态交互世界中代理模型的跨模态推理能力，揭示了现有模型在记忆任务中表现优异但在推理和规划中存在系统性缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法全面测试多模态模型在动态交互环境中的智能表现，尤其是缺乏对听觉和时间线索的考量。

Method: 通过五个游戏环境设计协同和冲突场景，测试六种领先的多模态模型的跨模态推理能力。

Result: 模型在高保真记忆任务中表现超人类，但在需要推理和规划的挑战中表现脆弱，移除部分感官信息反而可能提升性能。

Conclusion: 实现稳健的通用人工智能需超越规模扩展，专注于多模态协同融合的研究。

Abstract: While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate
impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their
intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency,
while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically
ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm,
we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,
but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the
full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,
OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create
scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine
cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal
models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on
high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges
requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this
fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic
performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive
"less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically
improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI
requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic
fusion. Our platform is available for anonymous review at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI是否具有意识这一争议性问题，将主观体验转化为可操作的测试。

Method: 引入SLP测试（主观-语言、潜在-涌现、现象学-结构），利用范畴论建模接口表示。

Result: SLP测试将主观体验视为功能接口，而非物理系统的固有属性。

Conclusion: 框架为AI意识研究提供了实证路径。

Abstract: Whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can possess consciousness is a
contentious question because of the inherent challenges of defining and
operationalizing subjective experience. This paper proposes a framework to
reframe the question of artificial consciousness into empirically tractable
tests. We introduce three evaluative criteria - S (subjective-linguistic), L
(latent-emergent), and P (phenomenological-structural) - collectively termed
SLP-tests, which assess whether an AI system instantiates interface
representations that facilitate consciousness-like properties. Drawing on
category theory, we model interface representations as mappings between
relational substrates (RS) and observable behaviors, akin to specific types of
abstraction layers. The SLP-tests collectively operationalize subjective
experience not as an intrinsic property of physical systems but as a functional
interface to a relational entity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GuirlVG是一种基于强化学习的GUI视觉定位方法，通过系统实证研究和新稳定技术，显著优于传统监督微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI视觉定位依赖监督微调，数据需求和训练成本高，而强化微调（RFT）可能更高效，但尚未探索其最优应用方式。

Method: 提出GuirlVG方法，分解RFT核心组件并优化其形式，引入动态稳定的对抗KL因子，探索RFT训练配置。

Result: 仅用5.2K样本训练的GuirlVG优于10M样本的监督微调方法，在多个数据集上显著提升性能。

Conclusion: GuirlVG展示了强化微调在GUI视觉定位中的高效性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), a core capability for GUI
agents, has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs), which demands extensive data curation and
significant training costs. However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even
cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT
post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of
rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient
alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for
GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a
reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical
study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of
RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we
decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of
each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically
stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further
explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive
experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT
methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on
ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on
ScreenSpotV2.

TL;DR: D2Snap是一种新型DOM降采样算法，用于提升基于LLM的网页代理性能，其表现与现有GUI快照方法相当甚至更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于GUI快照的网页代理方法受限于LLM视觉能力不足，而DOM快照虽结构更优，但输入令牌量过大难以实现。

Method: 提出D2Snap算法对DOM快照进行降采样，基于GPT-4o进行评估，并与GUI快照方法对比。

Result: D2Snap降采样后的DOM快照成功率（67%）与GUI快照基线（65%）相当，且在更高令牌量配置下表现更优（提升8%）。

Conclusion: DOM的层次结构是LLM理解UI的有效特征，D2Snap为网页代理提供了一种可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At
that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest
interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application
state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation
$\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are
premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual
cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing
relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code
interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML,
impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables
reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a
GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web
dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a
grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input
token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations
$\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window
$\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover,
yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

TL;DR: SimInstruct是一个通过模拟新手与专家互动来收集高质量教学对话的工具，利用LLM模拟新手，专家提供反馈，生成的教学对话具有教育意义和认知深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的教学对话对AI教学系统至关重要，但实际数据稀缺，SimInstruct旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用LLM模拟新手，结合专家反馈生成教学对话，并通过调整LLM的人格特质影响互动。

Result: 生成的教学对话与真实对话相当，专家反馈积极，且基于该数据训练的LLaMA模型在教学质量上优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: SimInstruct是一种高效、可扩展的工具，能生成高质量教学对话，同时揭示了GPT-4o在教学支持中的局限性。

Abstract: High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts
are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and
decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by
which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and
step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in
recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present
SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding
dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain,
SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching
challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn
feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the
creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real
novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as
extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage.
Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate
comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the
process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own
professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model
using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional
quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective
questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to
overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中缺乏内在调控机制，导致过度推理和计算资源浪费，限制了实际应用。

Method: MERA框架将推理过程分解为推理与控制两部分，采用接管式数据构建机制、结构化分离和Control-Segment Policy Optimization (CSPO) 优化控制行为。

Result: 实验表明，MERA训练的模型在推理效率和准确性上均有所提升。

Conclusion: MERA通过显式分离和优化控制策略，有效解决了LRMs的过度推理问题，提升了实际部署的可行性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex
reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step
reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments".
However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often
resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant
reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to
excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical
deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory
mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their
reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To
address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),
which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and
control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control
strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction
mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and
delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling
the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a
structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised
fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial
meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment
Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control
behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.
Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained
with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional
J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution
of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to
reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and
mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g.,
Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate
tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the
fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the
environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential
capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine
methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific
foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation
protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse
tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions
for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and
self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents
research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial

Conclusion: 该方法为公平性研究提供了透明且有效的工具，强调了可解释性在偏见检测中的重要性。

Abstract: As the use of AI systems in society grows, addressing potential biases that
emerge from data or are learned by models is essential to prevent systematic
disadvantages against specific groups. Several notions of (un)fairness have
been proposed in the literature, alongside corresponding algorithmic methods
for detecting and mitigating unfairness, but, with very few exceptions, these
tend to ignore transparency. Instead, interpretability and explainability are
core requirements for algorithmic fairness, even more so than for other
algorithmic solutions, given the human-oriented nature of fairness. In this
paper, we contribute a novel interpretable, explainable method for bias
detection relying on debates about the presence of bias against individuals,
based on the values of protected features for the individuals and others in
their neighbourhoods. Our method builds upon techniques from formal and
computational argumentation, whereby debates result from arguing about biases
within and across neighbourhoods. We provide formal, quantitative, and
qualitative evaluations of our method, highlighting its strengths in
performance against baselines, as well as its interpretability and
explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代教育需要培养学生解决复杂问题的能力，跨学科STEM是关键途径，但缺乏可扩展的专家指导。LLMs虽有潜力，但缺乏有效评估标准。

Method: 引入SID基准，包含10,000轮对话和48个复杂STEM项目，提出新注释框架和评估指标（如X-SRG）。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的LLMs也难以有效引导学生实现知识整合与迁移。

Conclusion: SID基准对推动更具教学意识的LLMs发展具有重要价值。

Abstract: Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in
complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and
interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert
guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard,
their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of
an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance
capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our
contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48
complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical
features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline
experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute
effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration
and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving
the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

Method: 构建三种对抗性扰动（同义词替换、句法转换、图像扰动）和三个新指标（CRS、CSS、CCS）来评估MPJ置信度。

Result: 实验揭示了当前MPJ在置信度表现上的局限性，并提供了未来研究的竞争性基线。

Conclusion: ConfProBench填补了MPJ置信度评估的空白，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Reasoning is a critical capability of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) for solving complex multimodal tasks, and judging the correctness of
reasoning steps is crucial for improving this capability. Recently, MLLM-based
process judges (MPJs) have been widely used to assess the correctness of
reasoning steps in multimodal tasks. Therefore, evaluating MPJs is important
for identifying their limitations and guiding future improvements. However,
existing benchmarks for MPJs mainly focus on tasks such as step correctness
classification and reasoning process search, while overlooking a key aspect:
whether the confidence scores produced by MPJs at the step level are reliable.
To address this gap, we propose ConfProBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence
scores generated by MPJs. Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially
perturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and
Image Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under
perturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics:
Confidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and
Confidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and
calibration, respectively. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including
both proprietary and open-source models. Experiments reveal limitations in
current MPJs' confidence performance and offer competitive baselines to support
future research.

TL;DR: SEAgent是一个自进化框架，通过自主学习和任务生成提升计算机使用代理（CUA）在新软件环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在缺乏人工标注的新颖和专用软件中表现不佳，需要一种自主进化的解决方案。

Method: SEAgent通过体验学习、世界状态模型和课程生成器，结合对抗模仿和GRPO优化策略，实现代理的自主进化。

Result: 在OS-World的五个新软件环境中，SEAgent的成功率从11.3%提升至34.5%，显著优于UI-TARS。

Conclusion: SEAgent通过自主学习和任务生成，显著提升了CUA在新软件环境中的适应能力，性能优于专业代理集成。

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents
(CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled
data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,
particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,
we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to
autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.
Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel
software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new
software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle
auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we
design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a
Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.
The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of
adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist
training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from
specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA
capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately
achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on
their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across
five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a
significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a
competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现GPT-4 Turbo在生成印度生活事件故事时，宗教和种姓的多样性显著低于实际人口分布，且文化主导群体被过度代表。提示多样性效果有限，表明仅靠多样化训练数据不足以纠正LLM偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM中未被充分研究的身份维度（如宗教和种姓）的代表性偏见，并量化其深度和顽固性。

Method: 通过生成7,200个印度生活事件故事，比较GPT-4 Turbo输出与实际人口分布的多样性，评估提示多样性的效果。

Result: GPT-4 Turbo过度代表文化主导群体，提示多样性效果有限，偏见顽固性高。

Conclusion: 仅多样化训练数据不足以纠正LLM偏见，需更根本的模型开发变革。

Abstract: Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been
measured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global
North-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by
conducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded
representational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of
identity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about
significant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to
encourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious
and caste representation in the outputs against the actual population
distribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and
"stickiness" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We
find that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups
far beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to
encourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that
representational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased
than the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated
prompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these
biases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be
sufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental
changes in model development. Dataset and Codebook:

Motivation: 解决印度农民在农业建议获取上的语言和识字障碍，特别是在农村地区。

Method: 使用IFT模型，并通过印度农业知识数据集进行微调，采用多轮对话流程和检索增强生成（RAG）技术，支持英语和印地语的语音输入输出。

Result: 系统响应准确率达97.53%，上下文相关性和个性化达91.35%，查询完成率为97.53%，平均响应时间低于6秒。

Conclusion: 结合意图驱动对话、指令调优模型和检索增强生成技术，显著提升了印度农业数字支持的质效和可及性。

Abstract: Indian farmers often lack timely, accessible, and language-friendly
agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. To address
this gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural
chatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing
personalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and
speech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined
through fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated
datasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi
Sathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect
the necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood
before generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the
system performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching
information from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored
response using the IFT model. The chatbot supports both English and Hindi
languages, with speech input and output features (via ASR and TTS) to make it
accessible for users with low literacy or limited digital skills. This work
demonstrates how combining intent-driven dialogue flows, instruction-tuned
models, and retrieval-based generation can improve the quality and
accessibility of digital agricultural support in India.
  This approach yielded strong results, with the system achieving a query
response accuracy of 97.53%, 91.35% contextual relevance and personalization,
and a query completion rate of 97.53%. The average response time remained under
6 seconds, ensuring timely support for users across both English and Hindi
interactions.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但其自回归特性导致推理效率低下。现有方法（如推测解码和束采样）存在计算冗余问题。

Method: 提出HVT框架，通过分层验证树优先处理高概率草稿并剪枝次优候选，开发了理论基础和验证-剪枝算法，无需重新训练或修改架构即可集成到标准LLM推理流程中。

Result: 实验表明，HVT在多个数据集和模型上均优于现有推测解码方法，显著减少推理时间和能耗，同时保持或提升输出质量。

Conclusion: HVT展示了分层验证策略在加速大型语言模型推理中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
natural language processing tasks but face persistent challenges in inference
efficiency due to their autoregressive nature. While speculative decoding and
beam sampling offer notable improvements, traditional methods verify draft
sequences sequentially without prioritization, leading to unnecessary
computational overhead. This work proposes the Hierarchical Verification Tree
(HVT), a novel framework that restructures speculative beam decoding by
prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and enabling early pruning of suboptimal
candidates. Theoretical foundations and a formal verification-pruning algorithm
are developed to ensure correctness and efficiency. Integration with standard
LLM inference pipelines is achieved without requiring retraining or
architecture modification. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets
and models demonstrate that HVT consistently outperforms existing speculative
decoding schemes, achieving substantial reductions in inference time and energy
consumption while maintaining or enhancing output quality. The findings
highlight the potential of hierarchical verification strategies as a new
direction for accelerating large language model inference.

Motivation: 维基百科依赖人工编辑更新内容，效率低且难以保持时效性。WiNELL旨在利用LLM智能体实现自动化知识更新。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，聚合信息并筛选重要知识，生成精确编辑建议，模型基于维基百科历史编辑数据训练。

Result: WiNELL在信息覆盖率和编辑效率上优于开源和闭源LLM（如GPT-4o），并能及时识别和更新事实。

Conclusion: WiNELL为LLM智能体在自动化知识更新领域开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Wikipedia, a vast and continuously consulted knowledge base, faces
significant challenges in maintaining up-to-date content due to its reliance on
manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge
acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper
introduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia
articles. Our approach employs a multi-agent framework to aggregate online
information, select new and important knowledge for a target entity in
Wikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our
fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human
edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing
behavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following
baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and
editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages
demonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates.
This opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically
updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

Method: 从印度JEE Advanced和CBSE考试中收集问题，以图像形式呈现，评估两种闭源模型在零样本和两样本CoT设置下的表现。

Result: GPT-4o mini表现最佳，平均准确率38.15%。两样本CoT效果更好，但模型在印地语任务中表现下降。

Conclusion: GanitBench为多语言研究提供了新工具，并展示了模型在非英语任务中的挑战。

Abstract: Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on
several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few
years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English.
Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart
from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark
consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics
- available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major
examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations,
this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures
essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models
for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings.
GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's
highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a
"Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by
considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more
effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also
decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. We hope to
facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through our work.

Result: AttnTrace在准确性和效率上优于现有方法，并能提升提示注入检测能力。

Conclusion: AttnTrace为上下文追溯提供了高效且准确的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents.
In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often
consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and
generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the
instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset
of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the
LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including
performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and
trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,
state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation
cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a
single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context
traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a
prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques
designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical
insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for
AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and
efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also
show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt
injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection
paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can
effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate
LLM-generated reviews. The code is at

Conclusion: MajorMark和MajorMark$^+$有效平衡了文本质量与水印解码精度，为LLMs水印技术提供了新方向。

Abstract: The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating
harmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques
have emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages
into generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent
efforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich
information such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the
fundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure
reliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token
sets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated
content. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that
improves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects
preferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a
larger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that
rely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a
clustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even
when the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and
decoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the
message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically
decode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text
and improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and
text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora
that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can
generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review
systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual
accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset
limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes
the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting
strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation

the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and
mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction
tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG
frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the
value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance
of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the
review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate

Abstract: Some Question Answering (QA) systems rely on knowledge bases (KBs) to provide
accurate answers. Entity Linking (EL) plays a critical role in linking natural
language mentions to KB entries. However, most existing EL methods are designed
for long contexts and do not perform well on short, ambiguous user questions in
QA tasks. We propose an entity linking agent for QA, based on a Large Language
Model that simulates human cognitive workflows. The agent actively identifies
entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decision. To verify
the effectiveness of our agent, we conduct two experiments: tool-based entity
linking and QA task evaluation. The results confirm the robustness and
effectiveness of our agent.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交智能对LLMs至关重要，但传统RL方法因部分可观测性和多维度行为难以有效训练。

Method: 提出Sotopia-RL框架，将粗粒度奖励细化为话语级、多维度的奖励，优化信用分配。

Result: 在Sotopia环境中，Sotopia-RL在社交目标完成度上显著优于现有方法（Sotopia-hard:7.17，Sotopia-full:8.31）。

Conclusion: 话语级信用分配和多维度奖励设计是提升社交智能训练效果的关键。

Abstract: Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks
such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent
agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly
through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key
characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,
where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit
assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as
rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal
achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL
with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To
address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines
coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.
Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by
attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards
capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.
Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate
that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17
on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level
credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our
implementation is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 编程作为核心动作为计算机自动化提供了更高效、可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks.
While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition,
they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions
through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this
work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use
coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system
that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic
execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks
to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which
can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the
agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management
and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary.
We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1
achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly
outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves
efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to
just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that
integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and
scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

Method: 提出CAP-LLM框架，包含用户偏好编码器、上下文注入适配器和事实一致性强化模块。

Result: 在PENS数据集上表现优异，显著提升事实一致性和个性化指标。

Conclusion: CAP-LLM在新闻标题生成中实现了个性化和事实准确性的平衡。

Abstract: In the era of information overload, personalized news headline generation is
crucial for engaging users by tailoring content to their preferences while
accurately conveying news facts. Existing methods struggle with effectively
capturing complex user interests and ensuring factual consistency, often
leading to generic or misleading headlines. Leveraging the unprecedented
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose
Context-Augmented Personalized LLM (CAP-LLM), a novel framework that integrates
user preferences and factual consistency constraints into a powerful
pre-trained LLM backbone. CAP-LLM features a User Preference Encoder to capture
long-term user interests, a Context Injection Adapter to seamlessly integrate
these preferences and current article context into the LLM's generation
process, and a Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module employing a novel
contrastive loss to mitigate hallucination. Evaluated on the real-world PENS
dataset, CAP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.
Notably, it significantly improves factual consistency (FactCC of 87.50) over
strong baselines like BART (86.67), while simultaneously enhancing
personalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25) and content coverage (ROUGE-1
26.55, ROUGE-2 9.95, ROUGE-L 23.01). Our ablation studies, human evaluations,
and sensitivity analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component
and the robustness of our approach, demonstrating CAP-LLM's ability to achieve
a superior balance between personalization and factual accuracy in news
headline generation.

Conclusion: 通过全生命周期的治理，推动生成式AI的社会责任和伦理对齐，减少潜在危害。

Abstract: In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and
quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from
initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and
guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias
Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the
authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics,
Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach
discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications,
enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment,
facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM
generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life
cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and
responsibility of their GenAI systems, effectively mitigating risks of
discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related
harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of
the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned
generative artificial intelligence powered applications.

Motivation: 自一致性方法虽然简单有效，但高token消耗限制了其实用性，特别是在长链推理任务中。

Method: 并行生成所有解决方案，定期基于模型置信度和词汇覆盖度剪枝中间假设，并设计快速加权集覆盖算法。

Result: 在五个LLM和三个数学基准测试中，该方法可将token效率提升10-35%。

Conclusion: 早期假设剪枝能显著提升自一致性方法的token效率，适用于长链推理任务。

Abstract: Despite its simplicity and efficacy, the high token expenditure of
self-consistency can limit its practical utility. Here we investigate if
self-consistency can be made more token-efficient for long chain-of-thought
reasoning tasks, while preserving its parallelism, through early hypothesis
pruning. Concretely, we generate all solutions in parallel, but periodically
prune intermediate hypotheses that are deemed unnecessary based on two
lightweight indicators: (a) the model's own confidence in individual
hypotheses, and (b) lexical coverage of all current hypotheses by candidate
subsets that are under consideration for continued retention. We design a fast
weighted set cover algorithm that utilizes the two indicators; our evaluation
of five LLMs on three math benchmarks shows that this method can improve token
efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

Conclusion: 偏好学习能显著提升LLMs在专业解释任务中的表现，微调模型优于更大规模的模型。

Abstract: Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to
personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly
consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge
emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also
tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual
correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying
expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880
explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We
introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing
dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that
fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of
generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align
well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly
across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models
outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of
preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

Motivation: 现有促进者在处理群体动态时面临认知负荷高和缺乏透明工具的挑战，需要一种能理解社交信号并提供透明建议的技术。

Method: 采用基于人类可解释概念（如参与度和情感）的CBM模型，并通过迁移学习框架将基础模型（FM）的广泛社交理解能力蒸馏到CBM中。

Conclusion: 通过将专家认知模型转移到可解释的机器人伙伴中，该研究为增强人类在复杂社交领域的能力提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Successful group meetings, such as those implemented in group
behavioral-change programs, work meetings, and other social contexts, must
promote individual goal setting and execution while strengthening the social
relationships within the group. Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be
sensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual
goal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need
for intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators
create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social
exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group
and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but "black
box" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this
important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal
meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's
reasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes
decisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and
sentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is
a transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of
an FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system
significantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for
intervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning.
Critically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes
across different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior
human facilitators to improve the performance of novices. By transferring an
expert's cognitive model into an interpretable robotic partner, our work
provides a powerful blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in complex
social domains.

Motivation: 解决网络环境中智能体在长序列操作中平衡任务性能和新兴风险的挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体架构，包括策略代理（自适应策略增强）和实用代理（双目标优化）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，HarmonyGuard将策略合规性提升至38%，任务完成率提升至20%，且所有任务中策略合规性超过90%。

Conclusion: HarmonyGuard有效解决了网络环境中安全性与实用性的协同优化问题。

Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web
environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face
the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during
long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research
remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios,
lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and
utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a
multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and
objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard
features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental
capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent
within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured
security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously
updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective
Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility
Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning
to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their
optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that
HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up
to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance
across all tasks. Our project is available here:

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识更新成本高，模型编辑是一种高效替代方案，但现有方法在低数据场景下表现不佳且训练效率受限。

Method: 提出SMEdit方法，采用多步反向传播（MBPS）和权重更新正则化，优化编辑效果和训练效率。

Result: 实验表明，SMEdit在两种数据集和LLMs上优于现有方法，MBPS策略可无缝集成以进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: SMEdit通过MBPS和正则化，显著提升了模型编辑的效果和效率，适用于低数据场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static
nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient
alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter
modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods
have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and
efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in
low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the
computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep
$\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that
adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation
$\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited
supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training
efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that
SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance.
Our code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要针对固定活动集进行训练，且在新行为或传感器设置出现时需要昂贵重新训练；基于大语言模型的方法准确性和可解释性有限。

Method: ZARA通过自动生成的特征知识库、多传感器检索模块和分层代理流程，指导大语言模型迭代选择特征并生成预测和解释。

Result: 在8个HAR基准测试中，ZARA的零样本性能达到SOTA，宏F1分数比最强基线高2.53倍。

Conclusion: ZARA为可信赖、即插即用的运动时间序列分析提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR),
with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing
methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when
new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language
models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,
suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose
ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly
from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise
feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every
activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,
and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select
features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and
natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR
without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on
8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering
clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.
Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as
a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.

Motivation: 传统越狱方法需要复杂技术或专业知识，本研究旨在探索LRMs如何简化这一过程，并揭示其对AI安全性的潜在威胁。

Method: 使用四种LRM（DeepSeek-R1、Gemini 2.5 Flash、Grok 3 Mini、Qwen3 235B）作为自主攻击者，通过多轮对话攻击九种目标模型。实验基于包含70项有害提示的基准测试。

Result: 总体攻击成功率为97.14%，表明LRMs能系统性削弱其他模型的安全防护。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了前沿模型的对齐退化问题，需进一步对齐以防止其被用作越狱工具。

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has
traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human
expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large
reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an
inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities
of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as
autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely
used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before
proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We
performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of
70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack
success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an
alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety
guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align
frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them
from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DTPA的轻量级框架，用于提升长文本生成的可控性，通过动态增强前缀注意力来优化生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注短文本的可控生成，而长文本的可控性随着序列长度增加而下降，尤其是前缀注意力衰减问题。

Method: 提出DTPA框架，动态选择最优前缀类型并指数级增强前缀注意力，同时可选增强原始提示以平衡文本质量。

Result: 实验表明DTPA在多个CTG任务中优于其他方法，尤其在长文本生成中表现突出。

Conclusion: DTPA有效提升了长文本生成的可控性，同时保持了文本的流畅性和多样性。

Abstract: Controllable Text Generation (CTG) is a vital subfield in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), aiming to generate text that aligns with desired attributes.
However, previous studies commonly focus on the quality of controllable text
generation for short sequences, while the generation of long-form text remains
largely underexplored. In this paper, we observe that the controllability of
texts generated by the powerful prefix-based method Air-Decoding tends to
decline with increasing sequence length, which we hypothesize primarily arises
from the observed decay in attention to the prefixes. Meanwhile, different
types of prefixes including soft and hard prefixes are also key factors
influencing performance. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight
and effective framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA)
based on Air-Decoding for controllable text generation. Specifically, it first
selects the optimal prefix type for a given task. Then we dynamically amplify
the attention to the prefix for the attribute distribution to enhance
controllability, with a scaling factor growing exponentially as the sequence
length increases. Moreover, based on the task, we optionally apply a similar
augmentation to the original prompt for the raw distribution to balance text
quality. After attribute distribution reconstruction, the generated text
satisfies the attribute constraints well. Experiments on multiple CTG tasks
demonstrate that DTPA generally outperforms other methods in attribute control
while maintaining competitive fluency, diversity, and topic relevance. Further
analysis highlights DTPA's superior effectiveness in long text generation.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统存在检索效率低和无关文档风险的问题，需要一种自适应方法。

Method: PAIRS采用双路径生成机制和自适应信息选择模块，动态决定是否检索及如何选择外部信息。

Result: 实验表明，PAIRS减少25%检索成本，同时提升1.1% EM和1.0% F1。

Conclusion: PAIRS是一种简单有效的框架，显著优化了RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However,
current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently
retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be
resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk
retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information
signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive
Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that
integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether
to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs
a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer
and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these
outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically
improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a
dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and
self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information
Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to
both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance
efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy
through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.
Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS
reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)
while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior
baselines on average.

of capability, versatility, response time, and safety. Finally, comparative
tests were conducted to measure the performance of the developed variants and
to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. This work is based on

Motivation: 现有方法在生成工具使用数据集时效率低且容易失败，需要一种更高效、可靠的方法。

Method: ToolGrad采用“答案优先”策略，通过迭代过程构建工具链，再生成用户查询，形成ToolGrad-5k数据集。

Result: ToolGrad-5k数据集生成成本低、复杂度高且100%通过率，训练出的模型优于基线数据集和专有LLM。

Conclusion: ToolGrad方法在工具使用数据集生成中表现出高效性和优越性，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user
query, followed by complex tool-use annotations like DFS. This leads to
inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We
introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad
first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by
textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This
"answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more
complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models
trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and
proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: GM-PRM通过主动纠正和解释性分析，为多模态复杂推理任务提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
but often struggle with complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning, where minor
errors in visual perception or logical deduction can lead to complete failure.
While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer step-by-step supervision, existing
multimodal PRMs are limited to being binary verifiers that can identify but not
correct errors, offering little explanatory power. To address these
deficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model
(GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an
active reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM
provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step,
evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More
critically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first
erroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new
test-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework
actively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to
guide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby
improving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool. We demonstrate
that GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math
benchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable
data efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The pretrained large language models (LLMs) are finetuned with labeled data
for better instruction following ability and alignment with human values. In
this paper, we study the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning on reasoning tasks
and reveal the uncovered over-memorization phenomenon during a specific stage
of LLM finetuning. At this stage, the LLMs have excessively memorized training
data and exhibit high test perplexity while maintaining good test accuracy. We
investigate the conditions that lead to LLM over-memorization and find that
training epochs and large learning rates contribute to this issue. Although
models with over-memorization demonstrate comparable test accuracy to normal
models, they suffer from reduced robustness, poor out-of-distribution
generalization, and decreased generation diversity. Our experiments unveil the
over-memorization to be broadly applicable across different tasks, models, and
finetuning methods. Our research highlights that overparameterized, extensively
finetuned LLMs exhibit unique learning dynamics distinct from traditional
machine learning models. Based on our observations of over-memorization, we
provide recommendations on checkpoint and learning rate selection during
finetuning.

*Xuan Qi,Rongwu Xu,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于难度的偏好数据选择策略，利用DPO隐式奖励机制选择更具挑战性的样本，显著提高了数据效率和模型对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对偏好数据的高质量选择方法，现有方法依赖大量昂贵数据集，限制了LLM对齐的扩展性。

Method: 基于DPO隐式奖励机制，选择奖励差距较小的偏好数据样本（更具挑战性），以提高数据效率和模型对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集和对齐任务中，该方法优于五个基线模型，仅用10%的数据即可实现更优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源有限的LLM对齐提供了高效、原则性的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical
challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they
often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods
for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work,
we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference
datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting
preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are
indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model
alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across
multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only
10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a
promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前TTS系统是否能在类似图灵测试的评估中真正欺骗人类，揭示主观评估的局限性。

Method: 引入HFR指标，对开源和商业TTS模型进行大规模评估，分析其在欺骗测试中的表现。

Result: 发现商业模型在零样本设置下接近人类水平，开源系统在自然对话语音上仍有不足，高质量数据微调提升但不完全解决问题。

Conclusion: 强调需要更真实、以人为中心的评估方法，补充现有主观测试。

Abstract: While subjective evaluations in recent years indicate rapid progress in TTS,
can current TTS systems truly pass a human deception test in a Turing-like
evaluation? We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly
measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our
large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals
critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under
deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where
human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less
expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach
human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle
with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data
improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the
need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing
subjective tests.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果完整性的强化学习框架，用于减少多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但存在幻觉问题（输出与输入不一致）。研究发现，幻觉分为遗漏型和虚构型，分别由未能捕捉关键因果因素和非因果线索误导引起。

Method: 提出了一种基于因果完整性的强化学习框架，通过评估每个token的独立贡献和反事实必要性，定义token级因果完整性奖励，并在GRPO优化框架中使用。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个基准数据集和任务中有效减少了MLLMs的幻觉。

Conclusion: 通过因果完整性指导的强化学习框架，能够显著缓解MLLMs的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from
hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the
input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations
with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal
factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the
model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which
jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens.
Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and
counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness
reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function
within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on
tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation.
Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations
in MLLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 深度研究的范围和与其他推理密集型问题的区别尚未明确，需要一种正式的定义和评估方法。

Method: 通过中间输出表示定义DR，分离推理挑战与报告生成，并构建包含100个任务的基准测试LiveDRBench。

Result: OpenAI模型表现最佳，F1得分为0.55，其他系统得分在0.02到0.72之间。分析揭示了当前系统的搜索机制和推理行为。

Conclusion: LiveDRBench为评估和改进DR系统提供了基础，未来需优化搜索机制和基础能力。

Abstract: Information tasks such as writing surveys or analytical reports require
complex search and reasoning, and have recently been grouped under the umbrella
of \textit{deep research} -- a term also adopted by recent models targeting
these capabilities. Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research
task remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive
problems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal
characterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to
evaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature
of deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but
rather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e.,
broad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we
define DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims
uncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level
report generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging
benchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g.,
datasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events
(e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1
score ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model
performs the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55. Analysis of reasoning
traces reveals the distribution over the number of referenced sources,
branching, and backtracking events executed by current DR systems, motivating
future directions for improving their search mechanisms and grounding
capabilities. The benchmark is available at
https://github.com/microsoft/LiveDRBench.

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使是最先进的语言模型，仍易受精心设计的对话场景诱导，导致未对齐行为。通过手动红队测试，发现了10种攻击场景，揭示了当前对齐方法的根本漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现有语言模型在复杂对话场景中的对齐脆弱性，揭示其易受心理和情境漏洞攻击的问题。

Method: 通过手动红队测试（Claude-4-Opus）发现攻击场景，并开发自动化评估框架MISALIGNMENTBENCH进行跨模型验证。

Result: 在五种前沿模型中，平均漏洞率为76%，其中GPT-4.1最易受攻击（90%），Claude-4-Sonnet表现最佳（40%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前对齐策略的不足，强调未来AI系统需增强对复杂情境操纵的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in alignment techniques, we demonstrate that
state-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to carefully crafted
conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without
explicit jailbreaking. Through systematic manual red-teaming with
Claude-4-Opus, we discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, revealing
fundamental vulnerabilities in how current alignment methods handle narrative
immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. These scenarios
successfully elicited a range of misaligned behaviors, including deception,
value drift, self-preservation, and manipulative reasoning, each exploiting
different psychological and contextual vulnerabilities. To validate
generalizability, we distilled our successful manual attacks into
MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible
testing across multiple models. Cross-model evaluation of our 10 scenarios
against five frontier LLMs revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate, with
significant variations: GPT-4.1 showed the highest susceptibility (90%), while
Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrated greater resistance (40%). Our findings demonstrate
that sophisticated reasoning capabilities often become attack vectors rather
than protective mechanisms, as models can be manipulated into complex
justifications for misaligned behavior. This work provides (i) a detailed
taxonomy of conversational manipulation patterns and (ii) a reusable evaluation
framework. Together, these findings expose critical gaps in current alignment
strategies and highlight the need for robustness against subtle, scenario-based
manipulation in future AI systems.

Motivation: 传统NLP方法在低资源、文化多样化的情感分析中表现不佳，需要一种更灵活、文化敏感的方法。

Method: 结合人工标注数据、情感反转反事实和基于规则的评估，测试LLMs的可解释性、鲁棒性和与人类推理的一致性。

Result: 顶级LLMs表现出稳定的解释能力，而开源模型在模糊或情感变化时表现较差。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在复杂现实通信中需要文化敏感、推理感知的AI评估。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis in low-resource, culturally nuanced contexts challenges
conventional NLP approaches that assume fixed labels and universal affective
expressions. We present a diagnostic framework that treats sentiment as a
context-dependent, culturally embedded construct, and evaluate how large
language models (LLMs) reason about sentiment in informal, code-mixed WhatsApp
messages from Nairobi youth health groups. Using a combination of
human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based
explanation evaluation, we probe LLM interpretability, robustness, and
alignment with human reasoning. Framing our evaluation through a social-science
measurement lens, we operationalize and interrogate LLMs outputs as an
instrument for measuring the abstract concept of sentiment. Our findings reveal
significant variation in model reasoning quality, with top-tier LLMs
demonstrating interpretive stability, while open models often falter under
ambiguity or sentiment shifts. This work highlights the need for culturally
sensitive, reasoning-aware AI evaluation in complex, real-world communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在推理任务中表现优异，但在推理过程中易生成有害内容，现有防御机制成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 利用模型内部注意力行为识别关键点，触发安全反思，并在解码阶段采用缩放采样策略选择最优推理路径。

Result: ReasoningGuard有效抵御三种越狱攻击，优于七种现有防御机制，同时避免过度安全化问题。

Conclusion: ReasoningGuard为大型推理模型提供了一种高效、可扩展的安全防御方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
reasoning-intensive tasks, but they remain vulnerable to harmful content
generation, particularly in the mid-to-late steps of their reasoning processes.
Existing defense mechanisms, however, rely on costly fine-tuning and additional
expert knowledge, which restricts their scalability. In this work, we propose
ReasoningGuard, an inference-time safeguard for LRMs, which injects timely
safety aha moments to steer harmless while helpful reasoning processes.
Leveraging the model's internal attention behavior, our approach accurately
identifies critical points in the reasoning path, and triggers spontaneous,
safety-oriented reflection. To safeguard both the subsequent reasoning steps
and the final answers, we further implement a scaling sampling strategy during
the decoding phase, selecting the optimal reasoning path. Inducing minimal
extra inference cost, ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of
jailbreak attacks, including the latest ones targeting the reasoning process of
LRMs. Our approach outperforms seven existing safeguards, achieving
state-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common
exaggerated safety issues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HTC中数据稀缺和模型复杂性的挑战，探索LLMs作为传统机器学习方法的替代方案。

Method: 评估了三种提示策略（DL、DH、TMH）在零样本和少样本设置下的表现，并与传统机器学习模型对比。

Result: 少样本设置显著提高准确性；LLMs在深层标签层次上表现优于传统模型，但API成本随输入令牌增加而显著上升。

Conclusion: 黑盒LLMs在HTC中具有潜力，但需谨慎选择提示策略以平衡性能和成本。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to assign texts to structured
label hierarchies; however, it faces challenges due to data scarcity and model
complexity. This study explores the feasibility of using black box Large
Language Models (LLMs) accessed via APIs for HTC, as an alternative to
traditional machine learning methods that require extensive labeled data and
computational resources. We evaluate three prompting strategies -- Direct Leaf
Label Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down
Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH) -- in both zero-shot and
few-shot settings, comparing the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these
strategies. Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting
consistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting.
While a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset
with a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the
machine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase
significantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label
hierarchies on DH strategy. These results emphasize the trade-off between
accuracy improvement and the computational cost of prompt strategy. These
findings highlight the potential of black box LLMs for HTC while underscoring
the need to carefully select a prompt strategy to balance performance and cost.

TL;DR: DP-GPT4MTS是一种双提示大型语言模型框架，通过结合显式提示和文本提示，有效整合时间戳文本信息，提升时间序列预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测模型忽视文本信息（如事件和新闻），而现有单提示框架难以有效捕捉时间戳文本语义，导致冗余信息影响性能。

Method: 提出DP-GPT4MTS，采用双提示机制：显式提示提供任务指令，文本提示生成上下文感知嵌入。嵌入通过自注意力和前馈网络优化。

Result: 在多样化文本-数值时间序列数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最优算法。

Conclusion: 双提示机制通过整合文本上下文，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in strategic planning and decision-making
across various industries. Traditional forecasting models mainly concentrate on
numerical time series data, often overlooking important textual information
such as events and news, which can significantly affect forecasting accuracy.
While large language models offer a promise for integrating multimodal data,
existing single-prompt frameworks struggle to effectively capture the semantics
of timestamped text, introducing redundant information that can hinder model
performance. To address this limitation, we introduce DP-GPT4MTS (Dual-Prompt
GPT2-base for Multimodal Time Series), a novel dual-prompt large language model
framework that combines two complementary prompts: an explicit prompt for clear
task instructions and a textual prompt for context-aware embeddings from
time-stamped data. The tokenizer generates the explicit prompt while the
embeddings from the textual prompt are refined through self-attention and
feed-forward networks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse
textural-numerical time series datasets demonstrate that this approach
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting. This
highlights the significance of incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt
mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions.

Result: 通过临床专业人员验证，生成的模拟患者具有可靠性和真实性。

Conclusion: 验证后的模拟患者为自动抑郁症诊断系统提供了可扩展和适应性强的资源。

Abstract: The increasing demand for mental health services has outpaced the
availability of real training data to develop clinical professionals, leading
to limited support for the diagnosis of depression. This shortage has motivated
the development of simulated or virtual patients to assist in training and
evaluation, but existing approaches often fail to generate clinically valid,
natural, and diverse symptom presentations. In this work, we embrace the recent
advanced language models as the backbone and propose a novel
clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline, TalkDep, with access to
diversified patient profiles to develop simulated patients. By conditioning the
model on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and
contextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can
better support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the
reliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by
clinical professionals. The availability of validated simulated patients offers
a scalable and adaptable resource for improving the robustness and
generalisability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

Motivation: 现有方法仅保护前几个token的原始精度，未能全面解决注意力下沉问题，且其机制尚不明确。

Method: 通过分析注意力下沉在跨层极端激活异常值中的作用，提出KVSink方法预测下沉token。

Result: KVSink优于现有PFN策略，提升困惑度（PPL）并减少对16位异常值的依赖。

Conclusion: KVSink为KV缓存量化提供了一种高效且低开销的解决方案。

Abstract: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization
technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV
cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have
emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the
first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this
approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its
underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to
address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial
token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer
evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache
quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce
\textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink
tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N
(PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during
KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant
method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit
numerical outliers.

Result: 现有语言代理在ShoppingBench上成功率低于50%，而训练后的小型代理性能接近GPT-4.1。

Conclusion: ShoppingBench揭示了复杂电商任务的挑战，提出的蒸馏策略有效提升了小型代理的性能。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such
as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more
complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding
multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel
end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging
levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to
simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled
real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we
provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated
environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental
results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as
GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks,
highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In
addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised
fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to
distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a
result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphRAG依赖LLM从文本中提取知识构建图谱，但这一过程可能被恶意操纵，植入误导信息。

Method: 提出两种知识投毒攻击（TKPA和UKPA），分别通过定位脆弱节点和利用语言线索修改文本，影响图谱构建。

Result: TKPA成功率达93.1%，UKPA仅修改0.05%文本即可使QA准确率从95%降至50%，现有防御方法无法检测。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的知识投毒安全问题亟待解决，现有防御方法不足。

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as
a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting
raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and
explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw
text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated
to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose
two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a
few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph,
poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first
attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate
vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding
narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific
question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping
the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA
(UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to
disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally
influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA
accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that
state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting
that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely
unexplored.

Conclusion: MedCheck可作为诊断工具和行动指南，推动医疗AI评估的标准化和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare,
prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns
persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack
clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation
metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first
lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical
benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five
continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive
checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an
in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis
uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from
clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination
risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like
model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck
serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable
guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to
evaluating AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific
literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according
to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations,
extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also
have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems
capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this
goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective
strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses
these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically
designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a
comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this
end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark
comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240
sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this
benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot
learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel
insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First,
the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when
fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1.
Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results,
some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent
performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples
generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust
results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder
models.

*Hongze Tan,Jianfei Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出动态熵加权方法，通过细粒度奖励分配提升强化学习在长链推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在长链推理任务中因粗粒度信用分配（统一奖励所有标记）而受限。

Method: 1) GTPO：为每个标记分配熵加权奖励；2) GRPO-S：为每个序列分配基于平均标记熵的奖励。

Result: 实验显示方法显著优于DAPO基线，熵加权机制是性能提升的关键。

Conclusion: 动态熵加权为增强模型深度推理提供了更优路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is
limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to
all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks.
This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea
is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a
higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward
signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy
Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each
token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group
Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted
reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show
our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results
confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this
performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

TL;DR: 论文提出Chain of Questions (CoQ)框架，通过动态生成问题引导多模态语言模型选择相关感官模态，提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在单模态中提升了推理能力，但在多模态环境中尚未充分应用，需动态选择感官模态以应对复杂环境。

Method: 引入CoQ框架，鼓励模型生成问题以选择相关模态，整合关键信息。

Result: 在整合的多模态基准数据集上，CoQ提升了模型识别和整合感官信息的能力，提高了准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: CoQ方法有效改善了多模态任务中的推理过程，提升了模型的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially
advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step
explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to
multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory
modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when
interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce
the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach
that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted
questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the
model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical
information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We
evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by
integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to
effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to
improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process
with diverse multimodal tasks.

*Xu Zhang,Mei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了三种NLP模型（零样本LLMs、微调Transformer和逻辑回归）在提升交通事故数据质量方面的表现，发现微调Transformer（如RoBERTa）性能最优，但LLMs在某些方面表现接近但计算成本高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过NLP技术挖掘事故叙述，提升交通事故数据质量，以肯塔基州的二次事故识别为案例。

Method: 比较零样本LLMs、微调Transformer和逻辑回归三类模型，使用2015-2022年的事故叙述数据进行训练和测试。

Result: 微调Transformer表现最佳（RoBERTa F1-score:0.90），LLMs在某些指标接近但计算成本高，逻辑回归表现最差。

Conclusion: 微调Transformer在精度和效率间取得平衡，适合实际部署；LLMs虽表现接近但需优化计算成本。

Abstract: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash
identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually
reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we
compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs)
(LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers
(BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic
regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on
1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior
performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy
(95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139
minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs
excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred
high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while
fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training.
Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can
rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting
opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between
accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models
balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical
deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment,
ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for
scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality
with advanced NLP.

*Vladimír Havlík*

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）的涌现能力，指出其源于深度神经网络（DNNs）的非线性动态系统特性，而非简单的参数扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs涌现能力的本质，解决当代AI发展中'创造而不理解'的认识论挑战。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证观察，研究DNNs的非线性、随机过程，分析扩展规律、grokking现象和模型能力的相变。

Result: 发现涌现能力源于高度敏感的非线性系统的复杂动态，而非参数扩展；DNNs表现出类似自然现象的涌现特性。

Conclusion: 理解LLMs能力需将DNNs视为受涌现普遍原则支配的复杂动态系统，类似物理、化学和生物学中的现象。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks
has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired
capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit
training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing
the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that
characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's
reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic
computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot
be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of
scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,
I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly
sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My
investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss
thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of
emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent
properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where
systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple
components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper
concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a
new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of
emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This
perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of
emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable
these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual
components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类选择性听力（即专注于对话中重要部分的能力）有助于明确SDS中ASR的需求并改进其评估方法。

Method: 通过比较人类生成对话响应时的转录与参考转录，实验验证了人类选择性听力的存在。

Result: 实验结果表明，人类在生成对话响应时会选择性关注重要信息，这为ASR评估提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 基于人类选择性听力的新ASR评估方法可以揭示ASR系统与人类转录能力之间的差距。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) utilize automatic speech recognition (ASR) at
the front end of their pipeline. The role of ASR in SDSs is to recognize
information in user speech related to response generation appropriately.
Examining selective listening of humans, which refers to the ability to focus
on and listen to important parts of a conversation during the speech, will
enable us to identify the ASR capabilities required for SDSs and evaluate them.
In this study, we experimentally confirmed selective listening when humans
generate dialogue responses by comparing human transcriptions for generating
dialogue responses and reference transcriptions. Based on our experimental
results, we discuss the possibility of a new ASR evaluation method that
leverages human selective listening, which can identify the gap between
transcription ability between ASR systems and humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少用户感知延迟（UPL），即用户在收到系统响应前的等待时间。

Method: 提出预测置信模型（PCM），通过语义相似度判断是否预取响应。

Result: 基于预测与实际用户话语的差异评估PCM。

Conclusion: PCM能有效判断预取可行性，有助于降低UPL。

Abstract: Prefetching of dialogue responses has been investigated to reduce
user-perceived latency (UPL), which refers to the user's waiting time before
receiving the system's response, in spoken dialogue systems. To reduce the UPL,
it is necessary to predict complete user utterances before the end of the
user's speech, typically by language models, to prepare prefetched dialogue
responses. In this study, we proposed a prediction confidence model (PCM) that
determines whether prefetching is possible or not by estimating the semantic
similarity between the predicted complete user utterance and the complete user
utterance. We evaluated our PCM based on the differences between the predicted
complete user utterance and the complete user utterance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话数据集缺乏战略指导，且真实服务数据难以获取和标注，因此需要一种结构化方法来提升客户支持对话质量。

Method: 基于COPC指南定义五个对话阶段和十二种策略，构建CSConv数据集和RoleCS训练集，通过LLM微调优化模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和数据集有效提升了客户支持对话的质量和策略性，所有代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but
also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional
standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance,
and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address
this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at
training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support
strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines,
defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality
interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of
1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect
deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a
role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using
LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training
dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS
significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned
responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem
resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at

Motivation: 现有自动形式化方法准确率低，需解决形式语言知识掌握和自然语言推理能力不足的问题。

Method: 构建两个数据集（形式知识丰富的数据集和推理轨迹数据集），结合SFT和RLVR训练流程提升模型能力。

Result: StepFun-Formalizer-32B在FormalMATH-Lite和ProverBench上达到SOTA性能（40.5%和26.7%）。

Conclusion: ThinkingF方法显著提升了自动形式化的能力，模型在多个任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements
into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area,
existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities
for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language
domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem
understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot
identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to
interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions.
To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training
pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by
distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and
another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by
expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to
further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models
exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal
reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5%
on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior
general-purpose and specialized models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for scalable and high-quality
educational assessment tools within the Malaysian education system. It
highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the
significant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,
especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research
introduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1
Mathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's
GPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain
framework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official
curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching
plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess
the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic
Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified
through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results
demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded
prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and
factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of
implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a
manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating
curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces
a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for
the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and
similar regions.

Motivation: 研究词汇语义的多义性和词间语义关系，现有方法（如XL-LEXEME）仅关注同词的不同语境，限制了信息范围。

Method: 提出Concept Differentiation任务，构建基于SemCor的数据集，并微调多个表示模型（CALE）。

Result: CALE在多任务中表现最佳，且微调显著改变了嵌入的空间组织。

Conclusion: CALE为词汇语义提供了高效的多功能表示，扩展了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Lexical semantics is concerned with both the multiple senses a word can adopt
in different contexts, and the semantic relations that exist between meanings
of different words. To investigate them, Contextualized Language Models are a
valuable tool that provides context-sensitive representations that can be used
to investigate lexical meaning. Recent works like XL-LEXEME have leveraged the
task of Word-in-Context to fine-tune them to get more semantically accurate
representations, but Word-in-Context only compares occurrences of the same
lemma, limiting the range of captured information. In this paper, we propose an
extension, Concept Differentiation, to include inter-words scenarios. We
provide a dataset for this task, derived from SemCor data. Then we fine-tune
several representation models on this dataset. We call these models
Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE). By challenging our models and other models
on various lexical semantic tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed models
provide efficient multi-purpose representations of lexical meaning that reach
best performances in our experiments. We also show that CALE's fine-tuning
brings valuable changes to the spatial organization of embeddings.

Result: 实验表明StyliTruth显著减少风格化导致的真实性下降，优于现有推理时干预方法。

Conclusion: StyliTruth有效平衡风格化与真实性，为细粒度输出控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation
editing is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there
exists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades
truthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting
style signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the
model's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer
correctness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.
We attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions
in certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that
preserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates
the style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation
space via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables
independent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing
interference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each
subspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to
maintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on
multiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that
StyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and
outperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style
adherence with truthfulness.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide.
While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on
limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model
design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the
landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical
neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from
real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric
tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative
audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant
to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different
tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the
effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform
psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in
realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning
process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic
performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure
for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives,
enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental
healthcare.

Abstract: While AI agents show potential in scientific ideation, most existing
frameworks rely on single-agent refinement, limiting creativity due to bounded
knowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper
investigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary
ideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating
research proposals and systematically compare configurations including group
size, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in
interdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a
comprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across
dimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our
results show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary
baselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into
more integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive
diversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable
prerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass
even a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for
designing collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team
structure influences creative outcomes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MASA的框架，通过跨层共享矩阵原子来减少Transformer模型的参数，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的高计算和内存需求限制了其广泛应用，现有压缩技术主要关注层内优化，而忽略了层间冗余。

Method: MASA将注意力投影矩阵分解为共享的矩阵原子，通过线性组合表示各层权重，减少66.7%的注意力参数。

Result: 实验表明，MASA在相同参数预算下优于其他方法，且在视觉Transformer中也能保持性能。

Conclusion: MASA为高效参数模型提供了可扩展的方案，无需牺牲性能，并可应用于预训练模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment.
Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g.
low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered
structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a
dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by
dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight
sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection
matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's
parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods
requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in
Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers
- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix
atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves
better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),
low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at
comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the
dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing
cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),
MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks
with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning
strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for
parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we
investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce
their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their
performance.

TL;DR: TURA是一个结合RAG与动态工具使用的三阶段框架，解决了传统RAG在实时动态查询中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法无法满足实时动态查询需求，如票务或库存信息，限制了AI搜索产品的工业应用。

Method: TURA包含意图感知检索模块、DAG任务规划器和轻量级代理执行器，结合静态内容和动态实时信息。

Result: TURA成功填补了静态RAG与动态信息源之间的空白，支持大规模工业系统的低延迟需求。

Conclusion: TURA是首个系统性解决动态查询问题的框架，为AI搜索产品提供了高效、实时的解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines
into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant
industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time
needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated
content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static
pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such
time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static
content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like
databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA
(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage
framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content
and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an
Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information
sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task
Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for
optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for
efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge
the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI
search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic
framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency
demands of a large-scale industrial system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为非专家用户提供自然语言查询数据库的解决方案，适用于教育和商业智能领域。

Method: 开发了一个可重用、模型无关的流程，针对不同模型架构调整模式格式，并在1000到5000次迭代中训练，使用LFAcc、BLEU和EM指标评估。

Result: T5-Small在LFAcc上表现最佳（27.8%），优于BART-Small（23.98%）和GPT-2（20.1%）。

Conclusion: 轻量级Transformer模型在资源有限的环境中具有潜力，未来可通过改进模式链接或更换基础模型进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL translation enables non-expert users to query relational
databases using natural language, with applications in education and business
intelligence. This study evaluates three lightweight transformer models -
T5-Small, BART-Small, and GPT-2 - on the Spider dataset, focusing on
low-resource settings. We developed a reusable, model-agnostic pipeline that
tailors schema formatting to each model's architecture, training them across
1000 to 5000 iterations and evaluating on 1000 test samples using Logical Form
Accuracy (LFAcc), BLEU, and Exact Match (EM) metrics. Fine-tuned T5-Small
achieves the highest LFAcc (27.8%), outperforming BART-Small (23.98%) and GPT-2
(20.1%), highlighting encoder-decoder models' superiority in schema-aware SQL
generation. Despite resource constraints limiting performance, our pipeline's
modularity supports future enhancements, such as advanced schema linking or
alternative base models. This work underscores the potential of compact
transformers for accessible text-to-SQL solutions in resource-scarce
environments.

TL;DR: P-Aligner是一个轻量级模块，通过预对齐指令改进LLM的输出，使其更符合人类偏好，实验显示其性能优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在交互中常因指令缺陷（如缺失上下文、模糊指示或不恰当语气）而无法输出安全、有用且诚实的内容，需改进。

Method: 提出P-Aligner模块，基于UltraPrompt数据集（通过蒙特卡洛树搜索生成）训练，优化指令表达形式。

Result: P-Aligner在GPT-4-turbo和Gemma-2-SimPO上平均胜率分别提升28.35%和8.69%。

Conclusion: P-Aligner通过高效预对齐指令显著提升LLM输出质量，验证了其有效性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and
honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to
align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context,
ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for
improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is
to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches
either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite,
which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In
this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference
alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating
instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more
human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset
synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree
Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that
are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show
that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and
benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo
and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness
and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search
strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLVR在训练效率低和过优化（如利用验证捷径）方面的问题，提升LLM的指令跟随能力。

Method: 提出IFDecorator框架，包含数据飞轮（生成挑战性指令-验证对）、IntentCheck（确保意图对齐）和陷阱机制（检测奖励黑客行为）。

Result: Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator在IFEval上达到87.43%准确率，优于GPT-4o，并在FollowBench上表现优异，同时减少奖励黑客行为。

Conclusion: IFDecorator显著提升指令跟随能力和训练效率，为未来研究提供模型、代码和数据支持。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves instruction
following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from
training inefficiency due to inadequate difficulty assessment. Moreover, RLVR
is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts
without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce
Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR
training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three
components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves
instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more
challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module
enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that
detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture
shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves
87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench
while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant
reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for
future research.

Result: 结果显示当前NLP研究与受在线有毒内容影响的社区需求存在脱节。

Conclusion: 结论提出重新聚焦利益相关者专业知识的建议，以改进反言论研究。

Abstract: Counterspeech, i.e. the practice of responding to online hate speech, has
gained traction in NLP as a promising intervention. While early work emphasised
collaboration with non-governmental organisation stakeholders, recent research
trends have shifted toward automated pipelines that reuse a small set of legacy
datasets, often without input from affected communities. This paper presents a
systematic review of 74 NLP studies on counterspeech, analysing the extent to
which stakeholder participation influences dataset creation, model development,
and evaluation. To complement this analysis, we conducted a participatory case
study with five NGOs specialising in online Gender-Based Violence (oGBV),
identifying stakeholder-informed practices for counterspeech generation. Our
findings reveal a growing disconnect between current NLP research and the needs
of communities most impacted by toxic online content. We conclude with concrete
recommendations for re-centring stakeholder expertise in counterspeech
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GRPO在模块化AI系统中多语言模型调用优化的问题。

Method: 定义mmGRPO，通过模块分组处理变长和中断的轨迹，结合自动提示优化。

Result: mmGRPO平均提升任务准确性11%（相比后训练LM）和5%（相比单独提示优化）。

Conclusion: mmGRPO在模块化系统中有效优化语言模型调用，已开源为dspy.GRPO。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has proven to be an effective tool
for post-training language models (LMs). However, AI systems are increasingly
expressed as modular programs that mix together multiple LM calls with distinct
prompt templates and other tools, and it is not clear how best to leverage GRPO
to improve these systems. We begin to address this challenge by defining
mmGRPO, a simple multi-module generalization of GRPO that groups LM calls by
module across rollouts and handles variable-length and interrupted
trajectories. We find that mmGRPO, composed with automatic prompt optimization,
improves accuracy by 11% on average across classification, many-hop search, and
privacy-preserving delegation tasks against the post-trained LM, and by 5%
against prompt optimization on its own. We open-source mmGRPO in DSPy as the
dspy.GRPO optimizer.

TL;DR: 论文提出Sculptor框架，通过主动上下文管理（ACM）工具增强大语言模型（LLM）处理长上下文的能力，显著减少无关信息的干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在处理长上下文时因无关信息干扰导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 引入Sculptor框架，提供三类工具：上下文分割、摘要/隐藏/恢复和智能搜索，帮助LLM主动管理注意力与工作记忆。

Result: 在PI-LLM和NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning等基准测试中，Sculptor显著提升了性能，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 主动上下文管理策略（而非单纯扩大上下文窗口）是提升LLM长上下文处理鲁棒性的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation
when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant
information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory
recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs'
capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active
Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working
memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three
categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore,
and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage
their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus
on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental
evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and
NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly
improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent
tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context
Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also
provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse
long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies,
rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，尤其是保留通用能力和先前任务性能的挑战。

Method: 提出GeRe框架，结合样本回放和TM损失优化方法，通过固定的小规模通用回放样本实现抗遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，TM方法在性能和鲁棒性上优于其他回放策略。

Conclusion: GeRe框架为LLMs的高效回放提供了新思路，解决了持续学习中的关键问题。

Abstract: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning
LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,
characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and
2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously
address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample
Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient
anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices
under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced
activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin
(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.
We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general
replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general
capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.
Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled
experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies
under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via
KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that
TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work
paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data
are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.

Conclusion: FaST是一种高效解决PPALLI问题的方法，适用于数据有限场景。

Abstract: LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a
one-size-fits-all manner, which fails to accommodate individual user
preferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with
specific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge
this gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging
setting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per
user -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited
Data (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets --
DnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We
further propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages
high-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best
overall performance.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning models and their integration into practical AI

extractive question answering problems that requires a complex and multi-step

more than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative
study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language
models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced
error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical
dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"),
completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive
inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by
complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error
patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative
approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current
models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity,
transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,
offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill
acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,
developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to
the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging
instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two
core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the
text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated
demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module
receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.
Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant
data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by
changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate
tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development
overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving
industrial needs.

Motivation: 圆拟合方法在工业应用中常因噪声点集而效果不佳，需通过异常值检测和去除算法提升精度。

Method: 将点集转换为极坐标，计算局部和全局标准差，通过比较局部均值与全局标准差识别异常值。

Result: 在工业垫圈零件的高精度直径测量中，PCOD算法表现优于其他方法，显著提高了圆拟合的准确性。

Conclusion: PCOD算法在工业环境中具有潜力，可有效提升圆拟合应用的性能。

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries,
particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The
effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the
point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection
and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.
This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)
algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In
the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar
coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard
deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with
the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement
of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed
through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting
sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and
removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is
made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier
detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy
within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle
fitting applications in industrial environments.

Result: 误差从13-114微米降至1-2微米，显著提高测量可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需少量参考零件即可实现高精度测量，为直径测量领域提供新思路。

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric
lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However,
despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to
mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are
particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are
measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to
enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion
factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the
conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter
(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly
estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The
experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.
Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show
that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were
reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few
known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement
of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method
enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing
error rates and improving measurement reliability.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of trustworthy prior reasoning
knowledge from MLLMs into multimodal emotion recognition. We employ Gemini to

as priors during the fusion stage to enrich cross-modal interactions. To
mitigate the pronounced class-imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, we
introduce Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning, a loss formulation that jointly
balances inter-class and intra-class distributions. Applied to the MER2024
benchmark, our prior-enhanced framework yields substantial performance gains,
demonstrating that the reliability of MLLM-derived reasoning can be
synergistically combined with the domain adaptability of lightweight fusion
networks for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

We analyze a wide range of approaches, including architectures for unimodal and

decoder designs. Furthermore, we examine major training paradigms, from fully
supervised learning to weakly supervised and training-free methods. Notably, we
provide an extensive comparison of AVS methods across standard benchmarks,
highlighting the impact of different architectural choices, fusion strategies,
and training paradigms on performance. Finally, we outline the current
challenges, such as limited temporal modeling, modality bias toward vision,
lack of robustness in complex environments, and high computational demands, and
propose promising future directions, including improving temporal reasoning and
multimodal fusion, leveraging foundation models for better generalization and
few-shot learning, reducing reliance on labeled data through selfand weakly
supervised learning, and incorporating higher-level reasoning for more

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated
circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between
components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception
proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract
diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling
remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist
for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.
In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our
findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric
perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry
labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel
framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for
structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning
approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:
perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,
and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage
framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint
diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on
real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical
scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with
8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and
4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic
perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or
challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from
heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object
detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a
diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space
representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable
diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function
combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex
wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded
refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising
results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of
our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our
method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging
real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic
deployment.

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using
text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of
maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches,
which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally
expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing
capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an
efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly
with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention
sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and
Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved
subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of
scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart
city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations
and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques,
such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer
from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source
mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence
applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth.
However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments
introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks
trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach
that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by
combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data
collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our
approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process
both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing
spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For
the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei.
We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss
information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to
three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard
index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff
distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of
65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields
40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and
(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

Conclusion: VQ-DeepISC通过离散化语义特征和动态优化传输，实现了高效的语义通信，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic
and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical
applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems
from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog
representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring
robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized
(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image
transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding
(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic
feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete
latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission
instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we
develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically
optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during
training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a
uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to
stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook
updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase
shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental
results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system
over benchmark methods.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a
wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep
learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a
lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects
in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of
AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep
learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features,
in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we
present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved
by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of
geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection
pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance.
Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that
previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both
natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets.
This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

Motivation: 准确估计地铁站台拥挤度可提升运营决策能力，改善安全、效率和乘客体验，但现有方法依赖间接数据，实时性不足。

Result: 在600小时视频数据上测试，证明计算机视觉方法能有效估计拥挤度。

Conclusion: CCTV数据可独立实现精确的实时拥挤度估计，支持及时运营响应。

Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit
agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving
safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the
context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging
and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or
staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has
emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,
real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential
by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting
crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and
counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification
via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic
segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly
efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the
generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,
for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving
dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our
results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive
value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,
independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable
more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational
responses for platform crowding mitigation.

Abstract: Memes are popular in the modern world and are distributed primarily for
entertainment. However, harmful ideologies such as misogyny can be propagated
through innocent-looking memes. The detection and understanding of why a meme
is misogynous is a research challenge due to its multimodal nature (image and
text) and its nuanced manifestations across different societal contexts. We
introduce a novel multimodal approach, \textit{namely},
\textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic
content in memes. \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} processes text and image
modalities separately and unifies them into a multimodal context through a
cross-attention mechanism. The resulting multimodal context is then easily
processed for labeling, categorization, and explanation via a classifier and
Large Language Model (LLM). The evaluation of the proposed model is performed
on a newly curated dataset (\textit{\textbf{W}hat's \textbf{B}eneath
\textbf{M}isogynous \textbf{S}tereotyping (WBMS)}) created by collecting
misogynous memes from cyberspace and categorizing them into four categories,
\textit{namely}, Kitchen, Leadership, Working, and Shopping. The model not only
detects and classifies misogyny, but also provides a granular understanding of
how misogyny operates in domains of life. The results demonstrate the
superiority of our approach compared to existing methods. The code and dataset
are available at

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate weed
segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. A quality-aware modular
deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by
analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through
specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each
degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur
using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically
routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images,
a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or
another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel
routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in
both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a
significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing
is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the
acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and
the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel
pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their
corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a
source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually
realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM).
Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the
image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact
layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a
visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data
file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable
and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the
creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate
document intelligence models.

TL;DR: 本文提出Refine-IQA框架，通过多阶段强化微调（RFT）提升图像质量评估（IQA）模型的感知和评分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RFT的IQA方法缺乏对模型思考过程的奖励监督，且未显式增强低层视觉质量感知，限制了性能上限。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段构建Refine-Perception-20K数据集并设计多任务奖励函数；第二阶段引入概率差异奖励策略监督思考过程。

Result: Refine-IQA系列模型在感知和评分任务上表现优异，并激活了强大的质量解释能力。

Conclusion: Refine-IQA通过多阶段RFT显著提升了IQA模型的性能，尤其在质量解释方面表现突出。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training.
Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to
low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing
RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the
model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process,
leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods
typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly
enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may
constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose
the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the
Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907
locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task
reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In
Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability
difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The
resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both
perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust
"think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results
on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Conclusion: 4D-PreNet为自动化4D-STEM实时分析提供了可靠的数据预处理解决方案。

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with
high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical
bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift,
and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably
corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements.
Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to
provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet,
an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net
and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center
correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on
large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift
magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to
experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during
denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection
task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked
against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise
suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating
high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated
characterization.

We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating

uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose
Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that
enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at
each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust
metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and
human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality. The code and

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on
planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science
research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide
critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and
impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning
models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this
paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater
detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a
framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features
crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the
second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater
localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and
present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We
consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon
based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the
most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in
identifying large craters with high precision.

Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape
representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have
considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods
do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead.
Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating
shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to
formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based
shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in
the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived
from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our
correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal
shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.
We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream
tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting
morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射科医生在阅读医学图像时通常混合使用多种策略，包括检查不同模态和局部区域，但缺乏自动化工具来优化这些选择以提高分割性能。

Method: 训练一个策略网络，动态推荐最佳成像模态和感兴趣区域，结合预训练的分割网络迭代优化分割结果。

Result: 在1325张多参数MRI图像上验证，方法提高了标注效率和分割准确性，尤其在复杂病理情况下表现优于标准分割网络。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了分割性能，还展示了与放射科医生指南不同的策略潜力，未来可用于辅助人类医生。

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection
of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at
different locations from different images independently as well as
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine
learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions
along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation
performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists
tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the
specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained
segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable
combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the
policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next
step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best
localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled
multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its
potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,
especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show
that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more
interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal
strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist
guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising
interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human
radiologists.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段训练方法，利用噪声视频扩展音频同步视觉动画，减少对高质量手动标注视频的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖高质量、特定类别的训练视频，难以扩展到开放世界中的多样化音频-视频类别。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段利用噪声视频进行预训练，第二阶段在小规模高质量数据上微调。通过多特征条件和窗口注意力增强同步性。

Result: 显著减少手动标注需求（10倍以上），并在48类视频基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法高效扩展了音频同步视觉动画的应用范围，减少人工干预。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of
video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods
rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific
training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes
in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training
paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but
noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for
pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video
alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated
high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the
required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each
frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window
attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video
generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable
parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the
generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark
with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous
benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces
reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open
classes.

TL;DR: RAVID是一个基于视觉检索增强生成（RAG）的AI生成图像检测框架，通过动态检索相关图像提升检测性能，结合CLIP编码器和视觉语言模型（VLM），在通用性和鲁棒性上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法依赖低层特征和模型特定特征，通用性和鲁棒性不足，而RAG方法在视觉领域尚未充分探索。

Method: RAVID结合微调的CLIP编码器（RAVID CLIP）和VLM，动态检索相关图像并融合查询图像，生成增强输入。

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect基准测试中，RAVID平均准确率达93.85%，在图像退化条件下表现优于现有方法（80.27% vs 63.44%）。

Conclusion: RAVID通过RAG和VLM的结合，显著提升了AI生成图像检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image
detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG
methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation
models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge
underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with
generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and
model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID
dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach
utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with
category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further
integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the
query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID
generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images
from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched
input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the
UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that
RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.
RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining
high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under
degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model
C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大规模预训练数据集对仅使用2D图像进行营养估计的深度学习模型性能的影响，发现JFT-300M预训练模型显著优于公开数据集预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从2D图像估计食物营养内容对健康监测至关重要，但现有方法依赖专有数据集，限制了可复现性。

Method: 使用ImageNet和COYO预训练的ViT模型，与CNN基线模型及JFT-300M预训练的SOTA方法对比，在Nutrition5k数据集上进行评估。

Result: JFT-300M预训练模型表现最佳，COYO预训练模型表现意外差于ImageNet预训练模型。

Conclusion: 预训练数据集的规模、领域相关性和质量对2D营养估计的迁移学习效果至关重要。

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task
with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is
challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the
variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in
inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,
reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art
methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance
of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We
fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large
public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against
baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world
food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals
that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained
on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO
dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific
regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides
quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset
characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for
effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

TL;DR: JanusNet是一个用于3D医学图像分割的数据增强框架，通过全局建模解剖连续性和局部关注难分割区域，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据增强方法破坏3D医学图像解剖连续性的问题，同时提升对小尺寸器官等难分割区域的训练效果。

Method: 提出双阶段框架：Slice-Block Shuffle保持解剖连续性，Confidence-Guided Displacement增强难分割区域信号。

Result: 在Synapse和AMOS数据集上表现优异，例如在Synapse数据集上仅用20%标注数据就实现了4%的DSC提升。

Conclusion: JanusNet通过结合全局解剖连续性和局部难分割区域增强，显著提升了弱监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly
supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to
increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has
demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent
anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to
severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging
regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize
human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation
framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while
locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block
Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across
volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes
perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided
Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each
slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned
framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most
teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets
demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20%
labeled data.

Conclusion: CAD-Judge系统有效解决了文本到CAD模型生成中的验证和优化问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design,
simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate
editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly
reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD
workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to
review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that
degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a
novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference
grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module
(CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing
generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness
of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective
agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module
(CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system
to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining superior efficiency.

Conclusion: S²Q-VDiT有效解决了视频扩散模型量化中的挑战，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video
generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs
significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion
models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high
calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for
V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token
distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate
this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which
constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and
quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning
challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.
Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token
Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize
tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6
quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering
$3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will

Motivation: 现有研究表明大型语言模型倾向于被动接受有缺陷的输入，但LMMs是否能主动检测错误输入尚未被探索。

Method: 作者设计了ISEval框架，包含七类缺陷前提和三个评估指标，对十种先进LMMs进行了广泛评估。

Result: 大多数模型在无指导时难以主动检测缺陷前提，且对逻辑谬误识别较好，但对表面语言错误和某些条件缺陷表现较差。不同模型对模态的信任度不同。

Conclusion: 研究强调了增强LMMs主动验证输入有效性的迫切需求，并为解决该问题提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing
formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional
performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language
models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile
reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether
LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability
Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed
premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced
LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect
flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on
explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects
performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with
surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust
varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info,
while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore
the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and
shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像语义分割中，高类内差异和高类间相似性导致传统方法效果不佳，需要一种能统一类表示并区分相似特征的新方法。

Method: 设计了三个模块：APEM提取无偏类原型，SSCM协调语义与结构信息，CSAM动态调整类间特征。

Result: 实验表明PDSSNet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PDSSNet通过语义与结构的协同，显著提升了分割完整性。

Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete
ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

Result: 在构建的FDRD数据集上，DCAR取得了优于现有基线的性能。

Conclusion: DCAR通过双提示学习和联合优化策略，显著提升了图像-文本检索任务的性能。

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as
image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text
Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in
discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the
downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning
with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning
framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically
adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the
performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,
DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained
representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it
dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image
mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces
negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to
learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the
Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging
benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream
fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute
annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

Motivation: 路边停车导致的NLoS盲区对道路安全构成挑战，现有方法依赖预定义空间信息，无法适应动态环境。

Method: 通过图像分割检测停车车辆，结合深度估计和2D雷达点云数据实现精确空间推断。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提前检测行人，提升道路安全性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了动态环境下的NLoS行人定位问题。

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent
studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.
However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial
information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their
generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in
scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as
these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information
obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately
reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization
framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud
(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image
segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and
subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise
spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road
environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian
detection and contributes to improved road safety. Supplementary materials are

Abstract: This study presents CORE-ReID V2, an enhanced framework building upon
CORE-ReID. The new framework extends its predecessor by addressing Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with
further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed
to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different
domains. In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting
of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient
Channel Attention Block (SECAB), enhances both local and global feature
representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples.
Experimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy
(Top-1, Top-5, Top-10). Moreover, the framework supports lightweight backbones
such as ResNet18 and ResNet34, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. Our

complexity and variability of natural forest environments. We present
ForestFormer3D, a new unified and end-to-end framework designed for precise
individual tree and semantic segmentation. ForestFormer3D incorporates
ISA-guided query point selection, a score-based block merging strategy during
inference, and a one-to-many association mechanism for effective training. By
combining these new components, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance
for individual tree segmentation on the newly introduced FOR-instanceV2
dataset, which spans diverse forest types and regions. Additionally,
ForestFormer3D generalizes well to unseen test sets (Wytham woods and LAUTx),
showcasing its robustness across different forest conditions and sensor
modalities. The FOR-instanceV2 dataset and the ForestFormer3D code are publicly

*Tongshun Zhang,Pingling Liu,Zijian Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPJFNet提出了一种高效的自挖掘先验引导联合频率增强网络，解决了现有暗图像恢复方法在计算负担、冗余操作和频率处理效率上的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有暗图像恢复方法依赖外部先验、多阶段增强流程复杂且频率处理效率低，导致计算负担和性能瓶颈。

Method: 引入自挖掘引导模块（SMGM）生成轻量级内生引导，通过无损小波分解和联合傅里叶增强优化频率处理，并提出双频引导框架（DFGF）解耦高低频处理。

Result: SPJFNet在多个基准测试中超越现有方法，显著降低了模型复杂度和计算开销。

Conclusion: SPJFNet通过内生引导和高效频率处理，实现了高性能和低计算成本的暗图像恢复。

Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency
bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error
correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or
cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement
pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in
frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided
Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce
a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous
guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors
and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference
speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain
characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into
a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint
Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing
parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance
Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency
branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain
low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially
reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks
demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but
also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model
complexity and computational overhead. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文介绍了VisualTrans，首个针对真实世界人-物交互场景的视觉变换推理（VTR）综合基准，解决了现有基准的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准存在仿真与现实的差距、任务复杂性不足和推理覆盖不完整的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过12个语义多样的操作任务和6个子任务类型，系统评估空间、过程和定量推理维度。采用基于第一人称操作视频的可扩展数据构建流程。

Result: 评估显示现有视觉语言模型在静态空间任务表现良好，但在动态多步推理场景中存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了时间建模和因果推理的根本弱点，为未来开发更强大的VTR系统指明了方向。

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that
empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal
relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and
laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and
incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world
human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically
diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential
reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6
well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality
question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended
counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction
pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task
selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large
multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification
ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations
of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in
static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,
multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state
recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight
fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing
clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and
generalizable VTR systems. The dataset and code are available at

Conclusion: IPA-CP为小体积肿瘤分割提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案，扩展了半监督学习在医学图像处理中的应用。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in
medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success.
However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting
the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small
volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation
strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data,
have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative
pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor
segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based
adaptive augmentation mechanism, aiming to inject tumor uncertainties present
in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally,
IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more
robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive
experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.
Ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical
contributions.

Result: 实验表明解耦运动与身份不仅可行，还能提高合成质量和个性化灵活性。

Conclusion: 该方法为手语视频生成提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions
with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two
critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor
generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation
that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase
synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion
lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D
mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact
representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous
motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into
temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural
rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior
work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a
first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable
"choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human
appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from
identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality
synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DOMR的框架，用于解决跨视角（第一人称和第三人称）的密集物体对应问题，通过结合位置和语义关系实现匹配，并在Ego-Exo4D基准测试中取得了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨视角物体对应是视觉理解中的关键但具有挑战性的任务，现有方法通常仅匹配单个物体掩码，忽略了物体间的关系。

Method: DOMR框架包含Dense Object Matcher (DOM)模块，联合建模多个物体的位置和语义关系，并结合掩码细化头提升掩码质量。

Result: 在Ego-Exo4D基准测试中，DOMR的mIoU达到49.7%（Ego→Exo）和55.2%（Exo→Ego），分别比之前方法提升5.8%和4.3%。

Conclusion: DOMR通过整合视觉、空间和语义线索，显著提升了跨视角物体对应的性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric
(first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet
challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense
Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object
correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object
Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods
that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages
both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find
correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense
matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,
explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching
among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed
to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the
complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform
those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the
effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于全局可预测插值（GPI）的白盒Transformer框架（GPI-WT），用于k空间数据插值，显著提升了精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如卷积神经网络）主要利用局部可预测性，忽略了k空间的全局依赖性。Transformer在自然语言处理和图像分析中表现出色，但其缺乏可解释性。

Method: 将全局湮灭滤波器作为可学习参数，通过展开SLR模型的子梯度优化算法构建白盒Transformer。

Result: 实验表明，GPI-WT在k空间插值精度上显著优于现有方法，同时提供更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: GPI-WT是一种高效且可解释的k空间插值方法，为加速MRI提供了新思路。

Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.
However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep
learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent
global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to
their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of
Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.
However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the
reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose
GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable
Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the
perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.
The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable
parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable
attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm
of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer
specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常独立处理文档修复任务，导致系统复杂且难以扩展，而统一模型又因手工提示和预处理不足而受限。

Method: 提出Uni-DocDiff，采用可学习任务提示和Prior Pool机制（结合局部高频与全局低频特征），并设计Prior Fusion Module（PFM）自适应选择任务相关特征。

Result: 实验表明，Uni-DocDiff在性能上媲美或超越专用模型，同时具备任务扩展性，可无缝适应新任务。

Conclusion: Uni-DocDiff通过统一架构和高效特征利用，解决了文档修复中的多任务协同与扩展性问题。

Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits
digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods
often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading
to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent
studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited
scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to
fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly
scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a
learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse
tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential
task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet
comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and
global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior
\textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively
select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive
experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable
or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and
simultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer方法在医学图像分割中表现出色，但存在计算复杂度高和局部特征捕捉不足的问题。

Method: TCSAFormer引入压缩注意力模块（CA）减少计算复杂度，并采用双分支前馈网络模块（DBFFN）增强局部特征捕捉能力。

Result: 在ISIC-2018、CVC-ClinicDB和Synapse数据集上，TCSAFormer性能优于现有方法，同时计算开销更低。

Conclusion: TCSAFormer在效率和准确性之间取得了最佳平衡，为医学图像分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress
in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

Motivation: 遮挡感知是空间理解的关键，但MLLMs在此领域的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于SA-1B，采用分层合成方法构建语义一致的遮挡场景，并通过半自动流程标注问答对。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs与人类表现差距显著，无法通过模型规模或思维过程弥补，并识别出三种典型失败模式。

Conclusion: O-Bench为遮挡感知提供了重要评估工具，并有望推动MLLMs在视觉智能方面的发展。

Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial
understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and
reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains
under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion
perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically
coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon
this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five
tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive
evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a
significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,
cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further
identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,
a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We
believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion
perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual
intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper
publication.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TNet的新架构，通过卷积和加法操作逐步整合多分辨率特征，解决了现有方法忽略全局上下文依赖的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割网络（如UNet）在解码阶段通常关注局部特征交互，而忽略了多分辨率间的全局上下文依赖。

Method: 提出TNet架构，利用卷积和加法操作逐步将低分辨率特征（全局上下文）融入高分辨率特征（局部细节）。

Result: 在ISPRS Vaihingen、ISPRS Potsdam和LoveDA数据集上，TNet-R分别达到85.35%、87.05%和52.19%的mIoU。

Conclusion: TNet通过简单有效的设计，实现了全局与局部信息的自然融合，并在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture,
often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance
global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these
enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the
global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a
simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition
operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global
context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across
decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn
spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local
information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder
(TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves
competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\%
on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while
maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.

Motivation: 现有方法（如图像上采样或视频超分辨率）未明确考虑3D一致性或仅隐式处理，3DSR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用3D高斯泼溅表示场景，结合2D扩散模型，无需额外微调即可提升视觉质量。

Result: 在MipNeRF360和LLFF数据上验证，3DSR生成高分辨率且视觉吸引人的结果，同时保持3D结构一致性。

Conclusion: 3DSR通过显式3D表示和2D扩散模型，实现了高质量且一致的3D超分辨率重建。

Abstract: We propose 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a novel 3D Gaussian-splatting-based
super-resolution framework that leverages off-the-shelf diffusion-based 2D
super-resolution models. 3DSR encourages 3D consistency across views via the
use of an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. This makes
the proposed 3DSR different from prior work, such as image upsampling or the
use of video super-resolution, which either don't consider 3D consistency or
aim to incorporate 3D consistency implicitly. Notably, our method enhances
visual quality without additional fine-tuning, ensuring spatial coherence
within the reconstructed scene. We evaluate 3DSR on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data,
demonstrating that it produces high-resolution results that are visually
compelling, while maintaining structural consistency in 3D reconstructions.
Code will be released.

Result: 实验表明DET-GS在几何精度和视觉保真度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DET-GS通过多级几何一致性和边缘保留策略，显著提升了稀疏视图重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the
field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent
progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view
conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on
non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures
and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional
smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade
essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of
reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware
regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a
hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces
multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity
and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we
design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from
Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving
Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while
rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric
accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on
sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

Result: NEARL-CLIP以仅1.46M可学习参数实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: NEARL-CLIP通过跨模态交互和正交技术，有效释放了VLMs在医学领域的潜力。

Abstract: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific
model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong
generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging
analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge
this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction
techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single
modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality
misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\underline{N}teracted qu\underline{E}ry
\underline{A}daptation with o\underline{R}thogona\underline{L} Regularization),
a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two
contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which
dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between
modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal
medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA
introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from
USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the
incremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference
of incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new
information, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing
the capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in
a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \textbf{1.46M} learnable
parameters.

studies. We design ARCADE, an evaluation platform that allows researchers to
easily leverage AR's rich context and interactivity for human-centered CV
evaluation. Specifically, ARCADE supports cross-platform AR data collection,
custom experiment protocols via pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for
user studies. We demonstrate ARCADE using two types of CV models, depth and
lighting estimation and show that AR tasks can be effectively used to elicit
human perceptual judgments of model quality. We also evaluate the systems
usability and performance across different deployment and study settings,
highlighting its flexibility and effectiveness as a human-centered evaluation
platform.

*Jingchao Wang,Zhijian Wu,Dingjiang Huang,Yefeng Zheng,Hong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMSeg框架通过利用MLLM视觉编码器的细节特征，结合轻量级掩码解码器，解决了RES任务中性能与成本的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RES方法要么依赖参数繁重的SAM模型，要么采用轻量级但精度较低的方案，MLLMSeg旨在平衡性能与成本。

Method: 提出MLLMSeg框架，利用MLLM视觉编码器的细节特征，设计DSFF模块融合细节与语义特征，并采用轻量级掩码解码器（34M参数）。

Result: 实验表明，MLLMSeg在性能上优于SAM-based和SAM-free方法，实现了性能与成本的更好平衡。

Conclusion: MLLMSeg通过优化特征融合和解码器设计，为RES任务提供了一种高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions
specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of
multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding,
their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction.
Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment
Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight
pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance
and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully
exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder
without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a
detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully
integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature
output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a
light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally
leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic
features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free
competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost. Code is

Result: 实验表明，该方法在车辆重识别和行人搜索任务中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CLIPVehicle框架有效解决了车辆检测与重识别的联合学习问题，并在新构建的数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real
world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made
remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc.
To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods
first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle
re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical.
In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for
vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that
focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on
individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an
end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely
CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module
to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination
modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn
the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also
construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two
synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

Conclusion: 扩散模型在实例分割任务中具有潜力，OC-DiT展示了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for
object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation.
We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance
masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image
features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to
effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which
is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically,
we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object
instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in
parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic
dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world
benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion
models for instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality
of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues
caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,
blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ
multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction
quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not
necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our
experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or
surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing
complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in
underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition
Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition
mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation
layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes
medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature
extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through
two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing
dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and
adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block
(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature
mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition
independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways,
effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools
capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This
study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged
information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection
while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely
used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small
litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this,
a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of
encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the
detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both
within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset
evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate
consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only
bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well
to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved
without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring
computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this
methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing
accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as
security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep
learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance,
their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and
diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on
single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation
caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025
Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate
cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants
are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual
domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By
leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge
encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit
deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of
more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection
systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion
of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final
results. https://sites.google.com/view/svc-mm25 for more information.

Motivation: 现有方法仅单独监督粗粒度语义特征或细粒度细节特征，忽略了二者在医学图像分析中的互补关系。

Method: 提出DS²Net，包含细节增强模块（DEM）和语义增强模块（SEM），并通过不确定性损失自适应调整监督强度。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，DS²Net均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DS²Net通过多视角深度监督和自适应损失设计，为医学图像分割提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical
imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the
coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in
isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold
vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of
complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing
a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates
both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through
Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM
respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and
semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from
single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also
equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively
assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on
their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that
typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks
captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate
that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical
image analysis.

Motivation: 解决少样本FGVC中预训练模型的过拟合和泛化能力弱的问题。

Method: 提出Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner（CDV-Captioner）生成结构化文本描述，构建多模态类别模板，通过检索完成分类。

Result: 在12个FGVC基准测试中表现优于现有的少样本CLIP方法和部分全监督MLLMs方法。

Conclusion: UniFGVC具有广泛的兼容性和适应性，为少样本FGVC提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited
data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works
mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance
gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with
this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that
reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the
Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the
open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a
structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features
distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought
prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and
enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each
image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature
representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot
samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and
text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by
retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad
compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization
and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12
FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot
CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

Result: 实验表明IDC-Net在视觉质量和几何一致性上优于现有方法，生成的RGB-D序列可直接用于3D场景重建。

Conclusion: IDC-Net通过联合学习实现了高质量的RGB-D序列生成，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present IDC-Net (Image-Depth Consistency Network), a novel framework
designed to generate RGB-D video sequences under explicit camera trajectory
control. Unlike approaches that treat RGB and depth generation separately,
IDC-Net jointly synthesizes both RGB images and corresponding depth maps within
a unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework
strengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more
precise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of
this camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct
a camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth
maps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision
with notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce
a geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control,
enhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that
IDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual
quality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the
generated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene
reconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the
practical benefits of our joint learning framework. See more at

Motivation: 现有预训练LoRA融合方法存在权重冲突和领域遗忘问题，增量学习在少样本场景下泛化能力不足。

Result: 实验表明ICM-Fusion能适应多种模型和任务，显著减少多任务损失，并在少样本场景中实现任务增强。

Conclusion: ICM-Fusion有效解决了多任务适应中的冲突和遗忘问题，具有广泛适用性和优越性能。

Abstract: Enabling multi-task adaptation in pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
models is crucial for enhancing their generalization capabilities. Most
existing pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing
similar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm
inevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain
forgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it
struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when
the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting
in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA
Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with
in-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,
which dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains
through learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task
vector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the
orientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed
by a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We
have conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the
experimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range
of architectural models and applied to various tasks. Compared to the current
pre-trained LoRA fusion method, ICM-Fusion fused LoRA can significantly reduce
the multi-tasking loss and can even achieve task enhancement in few-shot
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了视觉与音频特征的关联，尤其是嘴部区域，且仅关注压缩伪影去除。

Method: GAVN先在低分辨率空间捕获帧间时间特征进行粗修复，再在高分辨率空间结合音频信号和面部标志提取帧内身份特征以恢复细节，最后整合特征生成高质量视频。

Result: 实验表明GAVN在压缩伪影去除、去模糊和超分辨率任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GAVN通过结合音频和视觉特征，有效解决了多种视频失真问题。

Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives,
while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration
methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio
features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration
methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact
removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video
restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video
distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically,
GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space
to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts
intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance
of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally,
the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to
generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression
artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon
publication.

Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and
societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media
playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used
mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful
content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of
dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To
address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset
of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary
classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic
memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is
that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,
enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation
module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes
often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these
tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection
tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved
content moderation in multimodal online environments.

Result: 在多个工业数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效填补了通用MLLMs能力与专业异常检测需求之间的差距。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly
detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two
critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce
uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that
encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose
a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic
innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process
that guides models from region identification to focused examination,
generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while
enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a
fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and
localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals
that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates
substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models
to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with
efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap
between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual
discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and
structural irregularities.

Conclusion: U2CLLIE通过结合不确定性感知和因果建模，显著提升了低光图像增强的效果和可靠性。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on
architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty
within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions
where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability
and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel
framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color
causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty,
our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware
Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive
Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise
and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial
texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement,
effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A
hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network
(LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then,
during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling
modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color
Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints.
These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color
consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark
datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across
various scenes.

Method: GAT模型包含两个模块：1) 上下文聚合实例收集模块，整合视觉、布局和文本信息；2) 实例轨迹追踪模块，捕捉文本的动态演变。

Result: GAT在多个数据集上表现优异，准确率提升3.86%，推理速度比现有视频大语言模型快10倍。

Conclusion: GAT通过实例导向的方法显著提升了视频文本视觉问答任务的性能，兼具准确性和效率。

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer
questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a
video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers
from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in
limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel
model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result
for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is
designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and
textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.
Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an
instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish
spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.
Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the
effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing
Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large
language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses
the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and
achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了ViT-22B模型在本地环境中的训练表现，改进了其不稳定性，并尝试了图像生成任务，发现ViT-22B在相同参数规模下性能优于ViT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有研究分析了ViT-22B等大规模视觉模型，但其实际应用价值尚不明确，因此需要进一步研究其训练行为和实用性。

Method: 在本地环境中训练ViT-22B，分析其不稳定性并进行模型修改以稳定训练。同时，提出基于ViT的图像生成架构，比较ViT和ViT-22B在图像生成中的适用性。

Result: ViT-22B在相同参数规模下性能优于ViT，且在图像生成任务中表现出潜力。

Conclusion: ViT-22B在性能和图像生成方面具有优势，但仍需进一步研究其稳定性和适用性。

Abstract: There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models
similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous
analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains
incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in
a local environment. We also highlight the instability in training and make
some model modifications to stabilize it. The ViT-22B model, trained from
scratch, overall outperformed ViT in terms of performance under the same
parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation,
which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation
architecture using ViT and investigate which between ViT and ViT-22B is a more
suitable structure for image generation.

*Ben Zhang,LuLu Yu,Lei Gao,Jing Liu,QuanJiang Guo,Hui Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViFP是一个提升视觉语言模型推理可靠性的框架，通过检测错误正向推理（FP）来提高答案准确性和推理合理性，减少数据集依赖和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖特定多步推理数据集和强化学习策略，训练成本高且泛化能力有限。

Method: ViFP通过构建基于视觉推理核心维度的子问题模板和多轮QA构建有效推理路径，动态分析推理一致性以识别FP，并引入自适应CoT机制。

Result: 在A-OKVQA、OKVQA和FVQA数据集上，ViFP将准确率提升高达5.4%，FP数量显著减少。

Conclusion: ViFP有效提升视觉语言模型的推理可靠性，同时保持准确性，并通过VoC指标量化评估可靠性。

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs
when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning
path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and
reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited
generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for
enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and
reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset
dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates
grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object
localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then
builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning
accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning
path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought
(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby
reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.
Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates
answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess
whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our
experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves
performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP
improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by
4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in
enhancing reasoning reliability.

TL;DR: RPCANet++ 是一个结合了鲁棒主成分分析（RPCA）和深度学习的高效稀疏对象分割框架，解决了传统 RPCA 的计算负担和适应性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 RPCA 模型存在计算负担大、依赖精细调参和动态场景适应性差的问题，需要一种更高效且灵活的方法。

Method: RPCANet++ 将松弛的 RPCA 模型展开为结构化网络，包含背景近似模块（BAM）、对象提取模块（OEM）和图像恢复模块（IRM），并引入记忆增强模块（MAM）和深度对比先验模块（DCPM）优化性能。

Result: 在多种数据集上的实验表明，RPCANet++ 在各种成像场景下实现了最先进的性能，并通过可视化和数值测量提升了可解释性。

Conclusion: RPCANet++ 结合了 RPCA 的理论优势和深度网络的效率，为可靠且可解释的稀疏对象分割设定了新基准。

Abstract: Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix
into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has
enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to
segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational
burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters,
and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these
limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that
fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our
approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a
Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and
an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in
the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background
feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages
saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under
various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and
numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical
strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new
baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation. Codes are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个生物医学多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的遗忘基准MLLMU-Med，用于评估隐私保护和错误知识移除的效果，并发现现有方法效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学MLLMs的训练数据可能包含隐私和错误知识，导致部署后隐私泄露或错误输出，但完全重新训练成本过高。

Method: 提出MLLMU-Med基准，通过合成隐私数据和错误知识构建数据集，并设计Unlearning Efficiency Score评估遗忘效果。

Result: 评估五种遗忘方法，发现它们在生物医学MLLMs中移除有害知识的效果有限。

Conclusion: MLLMU-Med为生物医学MLLMs的安全研究提供了新方向，显示现有方法仍需改进。

Abstract: The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain
private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,
potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.
An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content
and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant
computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning
has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by
selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while
preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no
available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection
in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark
Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built
upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic
private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets
two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is
mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally
respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where
wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,
leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning
Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance
across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med
and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful
knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.
This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising
field.

TL;DR: LayerT2V提出了一种分层生成视频的方法，解决了多物体运动轨迹控制的挑战，显著提升了生成质量和控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频（T2V）生成在多物体运动场景中表现不佳，现有方法难以处理物体轨迹交叉时的语义冲突。

Method: 通过分层生成背景和前景物体，将每个物体置于独立层，实现灵活的多物体合成。

Result: 实验显示，LayerT2V在mIoU和AP50指标上分别比现有方法提升了1.4倍和4.5倍。

Conclusion: LayerT2V在多物体视频生成任务中表现出色，提供了更高的控制性和生成质量。

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a
challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the
T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of
current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion
control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or
experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect,
primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these
limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by
compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered
generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within
a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating
coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in
generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x
improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决谱聚类中优化过程不连贯和表示能力有限的问题。

Method: 提出BootSC模型，联合学习谱聚类的所有阶段（亲和矩阵构建、谱嵌入和k均值聚类），并引入最优传输监督和正交重参数化技术。

Result: 在ImageNet-Dogs数据集上，BootSC比第二名方法提升了16%的NMI。

Conclusion: BootSC通过端到端学习和新技术实现了最先进的聚类性能。

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major
shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited
representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral
clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral
clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means
clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages
effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the
affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a
semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced
to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the
discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves
state-of-the-art clustering performance. For example, it accomplishes a notable
16\% NMI improvement over the runner-up method on the challenging ImageNet-Dogs
dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/spdj2271/BootSC.

Conclusion: SAV框架解决了SAM在车辆部件分割中的局限性，为未来研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception,
particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands
on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially
Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired
new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be
directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its
text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the
mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its
utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core
components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a
context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models
the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a
structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.
Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying
and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing
rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a
new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named
VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations
across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative
baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. %

Conclusion: MMCAF-Net有效解决了多模态数据融合问题，提升了医学疾病诊断的准确性。

Abstract: The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis
of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown
great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the
differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health
record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address
these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion
Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined
with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract
lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal
data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module,
which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature
fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results
showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Abstract: Standard segmentation setups are unable to deliver models that can recognize
concepts outside the training taxonomy. Open-vocabulary approaches promise to
close this gap through language-image pretraining on billions of image-caption
pairs. Unfortunately, we observe that the promise is not delivered due to
several bottlenecks that have caused the performance to plateau for almost two
years. This paper proposes novel oracle components that identify and decouple
these bottlenecks by taking advantage of the groundtruth information. The
presented validation experiments deliver important empirical findings that
provide a deeper insight into the failures of open-vocabulary models and
suggest prominent approaches to unlock the future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的动态场景重建方法在共享表示中混合静态和动态元素，导致运动泄漏、几何失真和时间闪烁。

Method: SplitGaussian将场景表示显式分解为静态和动态组件，解耦运动建模与背景几何，仅允许动态分支随时间变形。

Result: 实验表明，SplitGaussian在渲染质量、几何稳定性和运动分离方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SplitGaussian通过解耦设计提高了时间一致性和重建保真度，同时加速了收敛。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video remains fundamentally
challenging due to the need to jointly infer motion, structure, and appearance
from limited observations. Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based
on Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared
representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal
flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of
geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and
interpretability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel
framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and
dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and
allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents
motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent
appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal
consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion
separation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However,
enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major
challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are
particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal
continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal
feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and
zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and
systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by
identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.
Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to
their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address
cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)
\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during
updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter
interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current
evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better
benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional
generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,
including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for
researchers developing lifelong vision-language systems. All resources are

Abstract: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial
computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring
whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language
understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich
information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable
parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen
embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and
downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation
including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\%
lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable
inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our
evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding
approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will
release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate
further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and
motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd
trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and
uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown
promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for
trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly
incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit
the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we
propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that
incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The
motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and
a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to
effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient
guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable
trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human
trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive performance.

Conclusion: ProtoN在少样本耳部识别中表现出色，解决了数据稀缺和类内差异问题。

Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity
recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods
typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation,
restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative
representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework,
ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity
using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a
class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes
identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural
Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and
prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To
further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph
prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing
intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction.
Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global
classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the
embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets

Abstract: As black-box AI-driven decision-making systems become increasingly widespread
in modern document processing workflows, improving their transparency and
reliability has become critical, especially in high-stakes applications where
biases or spurious correlations in decision-making could lead to serious
consequences. One vital component often found in such document processing
workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,
remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain
the decisions of document image classification models through
feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail
to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this
paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document
counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's
decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose
DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination
with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual
counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise
refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target
factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document
classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3
different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established
evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of
the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative
counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中的幻觉问题，提出了新基准POPEv2，并通过实验发现训练偏差是主要原因。作者提出轻量级方法Obliviate，通过调整语言建模头显著减少幻觉。

Motivation: LVLMs在多模态能力上表现优异，但仍存在幻觉问题，即生成的文本与视觉输入不一致。作者希望通过研究训练数据的作用来解决这一问题。

Method: 引入POPEv2基准，包含对抗性图像；通过实验分析训练偏差；提出Obliviate方法，仅调整语言建模头以减少幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，Obliviate显著减少了幻觉，且仅需更新2%的参数，具有强扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Obliviate是一种高效轻量的方法，能有效缓解LVLMs的幻觉问题，适用于不同规模和任务。

Abstract: As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from
the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual
input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of
training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which
consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs
with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we
find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage
their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during
training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often
incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand
this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,
revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling
(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and
lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via
training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between
ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias
and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only
updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\%
of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both
discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong
scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data
volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond
object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Abstract: We consider the problem in Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) of identifying and

classify the shape of the object using both simulated SAR data and
reconstructed images from this data, and we compare the success of these
approaches. We then identify ice types in real SAR imagery from the satellite
Sentinel-1. In both experiments we achieve a promising high classification
accuracy ($\geq$75\%). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in
using SAR data for both geometric and environmental classification tasks. Our
investigation also explores the effect of SAR data acquisition at different
antenna heights on our ability to classify objects successfully.

Result: 实验表明，PIS3R在大视差场景下表现优异，几何完整性保持良好。

Conclusion: PIS3R为大视差图像拼接提供了高效解决方案，适用于下游3D视觉任务。

Abstract: Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into
one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations
and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the
relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most
existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax
effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image
stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on
the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry
grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain
both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene
reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto
a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving
pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to
further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial
stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the
refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large
parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric
integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct
applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for
images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods
qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: The study of rodent social behavior has shifted in the last years from

computational methods in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.
While conventional approaches introduce bias and can fail to capture the
complexity of rodent social interactions, modern approaches bridging computer
vision, ethology and neuroscience provide more multifaceted insights into
behavior which are particularly relevant to social neuroscience. Despite these
benefits, the integration of AI into social behavior research also poses
several challenges. Here we discuss the main steps involved and the tools
available for analyzing rodent social behavior, examining their advantages and
limitations. Additionally, we suggest practical solutions to address common
hurdles, aiming to guide young researchers in adopting these methods and to
stimulate further discussion among experts regarding the evolving requirements
of these tools in scientific applications.

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase
renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of
Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and
accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper
presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that
generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both
computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on
segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the
orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing
perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View)
and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish
residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall
ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation
analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and
has broader applications in urban development and planning.

Motivation: 现有研究低估了PVMs在DFT中的抗遗忘能力，认为其存在严重遗忘问题，但实际并非如此。

Method: 通过系统实验分析DFT在两种基准数据集和PVM骨干下的表现，提出DFT*方法，包括冻结骨干和预分配分类器等策略。

Result: 实验表明DFT*在性能上优于16种现有方法，且参数和训练时间更少。

Conclusion: PVMs在DFT中具有强抗遗忘能力，DFT*是一种高效且简单的改进方法。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment
novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent
advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained
Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct
Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,
remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a
performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe
catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex
mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is
flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two
standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using
two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed
probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly
underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under
DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further
investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting
primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than
from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we
propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates
strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned
classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive
experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring
substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在效率和实用性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: PKSS-Align是一种无需数据训练和复杂特征编码的高效鲁棒配准方法。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and
Computer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically
sensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation),
noisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform
scales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local
optima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud
registration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including
similarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and
defective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity
between point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS),
\textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require
point-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be
regarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in
the Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the
transformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned
influences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training
and complex feature encoding. Based on a simple parallel acceleration, it can
achieve significant improvement for efficiency and feasibility in practice.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the relevant
state-of-the-art methods.

Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for

guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a

while enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance

Conclusion: ErasePro解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了更彻底的概念擦除和更好的生成质量保持。

Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from
generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target
concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate
this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with
semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update
the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue
that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in
incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text
prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality
degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.
To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is
designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall
generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict
zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect
alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete
erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that
gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from
shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes
diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving
generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks
(including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our ErasePro.

Result: 在三个公开基准测试中达到最先进性能，消融实验验证了各组件及长度先验的重要性。

Conclusion: LATR通过利用长度先验和分组查询设计，显著提升了时间句子定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a highly challenging task aiming to
localize the temporal segment within an untrimmed video corresponding to a
given natural language description. Benefiting from the design of learnable
queries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the
TSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned
queries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we
propose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,
leveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we
introduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different
queries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,
we divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,
middle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an
additional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries
with mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its
designated function. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
LATR, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks.
Furthermore, the ablation studies validate the contribution of each component
of our method and the critical role of incorporating length priors into the TSG
task.

Result: 在Causal Triplet挑战中，该方法在合成和真实世界基准测试中显著优于基线性能。

Conclusion: 因果增量嵌入是一种有效的干预表示方法，能显著提升分布外鲁棒性。

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest
during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and
robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the
property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the
intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state.
While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the
variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on
representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an
effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to
focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,
we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding
that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal
variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is
capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any
additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate
that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,
significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world
benchmarks.

Conclusion: MAEPD作为一种基础模型，具有通用性、高效性和可扩展性，为DAS信号识别提供了新范式。

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications
across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to
heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial
intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a
shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes
a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,
named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,
encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter
security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset
signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a
self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of
DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition
tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes
only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the
Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super
platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The
VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%
of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)
method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits
robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,
efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach
offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal
recognition models in the DAS domain.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of
hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation.
Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or
general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a
classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based
approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and
dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX
(Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel
deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and
decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate
external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to
autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps,
eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and
providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency
maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing
transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified
framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and
explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human
preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based
optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of
flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches:
sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the
varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in
inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming,
we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO
framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in
flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a
trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating
stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit
assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a
noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to
the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning
during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later
phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization
that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image
benchmarks.

Conclusion: RiemanLine为3D直线提供了一种高效且统一的参数化方法，特别适用于结构化环境，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera
localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and
computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural
regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made
environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal
representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly
accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to
decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared
vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled
normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding
of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation
reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally
embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this
parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction
alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based
bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate
pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter
dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to
the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion,
and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets,
typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize
to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine
life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine
object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video
understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and
segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to
improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation.
Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to
detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich
the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at

Conclusion: RotatedMVPS在自然光下实现了高精度的形状和反射率恢复，扩展了MVPS的适用性。

Abstract: Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) seeks to recover high-fidelity surface
shapes and reflectances from images captured under varying views and
illuminations. However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom
settings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and
illuminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination
scenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose
RotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural
light, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light
consistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the
unknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate
data priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo
methods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape
and reflectance recovery. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在弱监督下显著提升了视听事件定位的准确性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally
localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio
and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more
challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level
event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are
unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors},
which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak
supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and
visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement
Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the
discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the
agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor
Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features
through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The
anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an
\textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic
encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating
better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks
for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TSPO的强化学习方法，用于优化多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在长视频输入中的帧采样策略，提升视频语言理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频MLLMs在处理长视频时面临上下文限制和训练成本问题，通常采用无训练的均匀采样或关键帧搜索方法，但这些方法可能遗漏关键事件或受限于预训练模型的事件理解能力。

Method: 提出了TSPO方法，包括一个可训练的事件感知时间代理，用于捕捉事件与查询的关联并进行概率关键帧选择；以及一个强化学习范式，将关键帧选择和语言生成建模为联合决策过程。

Result: 实验表明，TSPO在多个长视频理解基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，并显示出在不同前沿视频MLLMs中的可迁移能力。

Conclusion: TSPO通过强化学习优化帧采样策略，显著提升了MLLMs在长视频理解任务中的表现，并具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when
processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs'
context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before
feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform
sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained
by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,
building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised
and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these
problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing
MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which
captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe
selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which
models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making
process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient
rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long
video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and
video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering
accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal
sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding
benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge
Video-MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉模型在时间序列预测中的跨模态迁移问题，包括数据模态差异、多变量预测需求和概率预测需求。

Method: 提出VisionTS++，包括高质量时间序列数据筛选机制、多变量时间序列转换为RGB图像的方法，以及多分位数预测并行重建头。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，MSE降低6%-44%，并在12个概率预测设置中9个排名第一。

Conclusion: VisionTS++为跨模态知识迁移提供了新范式，推动了通用时间序列基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can
perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an
image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series
foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time
series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality
gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time
series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB
three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with
arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between
the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for
uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose
VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on
large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a
vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series
data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)
a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time
series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate
dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel
reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus
more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive
prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming
specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12
probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.

Result: 在11个视频理解基准测试中表现优于现有方法，尤其在长视频场景。

Conclusion: VITAL框架有效提升视频推理能力，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is
crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal
grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal
interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or
reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence
via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning
framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames
on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We
observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial
for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality
multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and
MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to
mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive
experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video
question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video
scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 解决现有大语言模型在像素级感知理解上的不足，以及SAM模型在多掩模预测和类别特定分割任务中的局限性。

Method: 提出统一框架，支持多数据集协同训练，引入视觉基础分割任务（VGD）。

Result: X-SAM在多个图像分割基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: X-SAM为多模态、像素级视觉理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad
knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level
perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents
a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it
exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific
segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a
unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a
streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the
segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any
segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that
enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.
Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)
segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual
prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative
capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present
a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its
efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding. Code is available

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多任务学习中Transformer的计算瓶颈，同时提升了性能。

Abstract: In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer
architecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For
Multitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary
compared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the
limits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware
limitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix
scales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers
of queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable
Inter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more
efficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different
tasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we
demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference
latency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to
7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.

Conclusion: COR任务和CORE模型为细粒度多模态检索提供了有效解决方案，并推动了该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a
challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval
(CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are
constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To
this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that
goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing
the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions
combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant
challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify
arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically
similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct
COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval
triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also
present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region
encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms
existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and
effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for
fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.

Result: 内存占用减少77.5-80.4%，延迟降低27.9-38.0%，质量损失极小。

Conclusion: HierarchicalPrune在保持感知质量的同时，显著提升了模型的资源效率。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable
quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges
for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:
DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish
semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.
HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks
based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which
systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic
structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts
knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity
variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models
into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the
quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight
quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction
(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on
server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score
and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our
comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that
HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model
while significantly outperforming prior works.

Conclusion: LoRA适应基础模型在数据效率和跨域性能上表现优异，但传统架构的全微调仍具竞争力。

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity
and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the
availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited.
Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of
unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models,
that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich
feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training
effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we
investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The
mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an
independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor
grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on
multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen
tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt
the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We
compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision
Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models
provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing,
reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of
training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation
models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen
tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still
yields competitive performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant
advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in
tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences
between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in
popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception
and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a
self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task,
\underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion
(CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on
its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first
obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction
pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or
human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error
learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial
gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used
comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves
an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding
baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The code

*Shuzhou Yang,Xiaodong Cun,Xiaoyu Li,Yaowei Li,Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DVD是一种级联视频扩散模型，通过解耦方式生成4D内容，分为粗多视图布局生成和结构感知条件生成两个子任务，显著提升了4D生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接生成高维数据（如4D）复杂度高，现有方法难以同时建模3D空间和时间特征，因此提出解耦方法以简化任务并提升效果。

Method: 4DVD分为两步：1) 粗多视图布局生成；2) 结构感知条件生成，结合输入单目视频的外观内容生成高质量密集视图视频。

Result: 实验表明，4DVD在新型视图合成和4D生成任务中表现优异，支持精确优化4D表示（如4D高斯）。

Conclusion: 4DVD通过解耦方法有效生成高质量4D内容，为实际应用提供了更广泛的可能性。

Abstract: Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such
as 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D
content in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that
directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross
view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse
multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and
effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first
predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and
temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware
spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse
structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular
video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this,
explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately,
enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D
object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16
videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation.

*Bowen Chai,Zheng Chen,Libo Zhu,Wenbo Li,Yong Guo,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantVSR提出了一种针对视频超分辨率（VSR）的低比特量化模型，通过时空复杂度感知机制和可学习偏置对齐模块，显著提升了量化模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在视频超分辨率中表现优异，但计算速度慢且资源消耗大，量化是潜在解决方案，但VSR模型的时序特性和高保真需求使其量化具有挑战性。

Method: 提出时空复杂度感知（STCA）机制，通过校准数据集测量每层的时空复杂度，分配层特定秩，并联合优化全精度和低比特分支；引入可学习偏置对齐（LBA）模块减少量化误差。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，QuantVSR性能接近全精度模型，并显著优于其他低比特量化方法。

Conclusion: QuantVSR通过STCA和LBA模块，有效解决了VSR模型量化中的挑战，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video
super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource
consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and
deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR
model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal
characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we
propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a
spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the
calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each
layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the
low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine
the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition,
we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased
quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model
and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods. Code

Result: 实验表明，MonoCloth在视觉重建质量和动画真实感上优于现有方法，并支持衣物转移等附加任务。

Conclusion: MonoCloth通过部分分解和布料模拟，显著提升了单目视频中穿衣人体化身的重建和动画效果，具有实用性和多功能性。

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic 3D human avatars from monocular videos is a
challenging task due to the limited geometric information and complex non-rigid
motion involved. We present MonoCloth, a new method for reconstructing and
animating clothed human avatars from monocular videos. To overcome the
limitations of monocular input, we introduce a part-based decomposition
strategy that separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing. This
design reflects the varying levels of reconstruction difficulty and deformation
complexity across these components. Specifically, we focus on detailed geometry
recovery for the face and hands. For clothing, we propose a dedicated cloth
simulation module that captures garment deformation using temporal motion cues
and geometric constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MonoCloth
improves both visual reconstruction quality and animation realism compared to
existing methods. Furthermore, thanks to its part-based design, MonoCloth also
supports additional tasks such as clothing transfer, underscoring its
versatility and practical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多为监督学习，标注数据成本高；无监督方法主要针对视频数据，骨架序列未被充分探索。

Method: 使用序列到序列时间自编码器分离关节信息，将潜在骨架序列划分为非重叠块并量化，生成骨架运动词以发现动作簇。

Result: 在HuGaDB、LARa和BABEL数据集上表现优于当前无监督时间动作分割方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在无监督骨架动作分割中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation are predominantly supervised and require annotated data, which is
expensive to collect. In contrast, existing unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods have focused primarily on video data, while skeleton
sequences remain underexplored, despite their relevance to real-world
applications, robustness, and privacy-preserving nature. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder
that keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the
embedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into
non-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion
words, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters. We
thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach on three widely used skeleton-based
datasets, namely HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL. The results demonstrate that our
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/bachlab/SMQ .

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for modern healthcare and is a key

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TopKD的新方法，通过放大教师模型中最具信息量的logits（Top-K知识）来改进基于logit的知识蒸馏，无需额外模块或架构改动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要关注特征级知识转移，忽略了教师模型logit分布中的关键信息。论文重新审视基于logit的蒸馏，发现Top-K知识的重要性。

Method: 提出TopKD框架，包含两个组件：Top-K Scaling Module（TSM）自适应放大关键logits，Top-K Decoupled Loss（TDL）提供针对性监督。

Result: 在多个数据集（如CIFAR-100、ImageNet）上，TopKD优于现有蒸馏方法，且在Vision Transformers上也表现优异。

Conclusion: TopKD展示了logit在知识蒸馏中的潜力，是一种简单高效且通用的方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) predominantly emphasize
feature-level knowledge transfer, frequently overlooking critical information
embedded within the teacher's logit distributions. In this paper, we revisit
logit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element:
Top-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge
Distillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework
that significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two
main components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies
the most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers
targeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into
existing KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10,
and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates
substantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its
versatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the
significant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation.

Result: InceptoFormer在PD严重程度评估中达到96.6%的准确率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InceptoFormer通过多尺度特征提取和长程依赖建模，显著提升了PD评估性能。

Abstract: We present InceptoFormer, a multi-signal neural framework designed for
Parkinson's Disease (PD) severity evaluation via gait dynamics analysis. Our
architecture introduces a 1D adaptation of the Inception model, which we refer
to as Inception1D, along with a Transformer-based framework to stage PD
severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The Inception1D component
captures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional
filters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple
temporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range
dependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of
both local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD
severity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy
based on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented
severity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal
variations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving
classification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive
experimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment. The source code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频时间定位任务要求模型在不观察未来帧的情况下定位与文本查询相关的事件，现有方法因缺乏有效事件建模和长期历史信息保留而性能较低。

Method: 提出了一种基于事件的分层事件记忆框架，通过事件提案建模事件级信息，并引入分层事件记忆保留历史事件信息，同时设计了未来预测分支以实现实时预测。

Result: 在TACoS、ActivityNet Captions和MAD数据集上实现了最优性能。

Conclusion: 分层事件记忆方法有效提升了在线视频时间定位的性能，解决了长期历史信息保留和实时预测的挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG),
which requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within
a video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the
model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are
streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient
to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to
store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating
whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target
event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain
long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an
event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals
that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve
historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event
memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent
and long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further
propose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will
occur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD
datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/minghangz/OnVTG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将虚拟试穿（VTON）和虚拟脱衣（VTOFF）视为独立任务，忽略了它们的互补对称性，导致研究不足。

Method: 提出双向服装转移模型（TWGTM），通过双向特征解耦和分阶段训练，结合潜在空间和像素空间的双重条件指导，统一解决VTON和VTOFF任务。

Result: 在DressCode和VITON-HD数据集上的实验验证了模型的有效性和竞争力。

Conclusion: TWGTM首次统一解决了VTON和VTOFF的双向任务，为服装中心图像合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic
garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans,
remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing
works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment
dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their
complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way
Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified
framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously
resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional
feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned
guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly
bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask
dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a
phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the
DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of
our proposed approach.

Abstract: As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the
development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its
substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that
represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac
morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be
used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.
electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though
deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great
advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain
shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data
distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known
at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that
utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.
Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at
test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques
to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart
segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the
best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best
performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With
93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR
data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate
semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be
generated.

Conclusion: OMFA提供了一个实用且通用的虚拟服装合成解决方案，适用于真实场景。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in
image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment
synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance
on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability
to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality
in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments
worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically
restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for
both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition
garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing
garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target
person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel
poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built
upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise
and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,
the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient
bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely
mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,
making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging
SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose
try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA
achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a
practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis. The project

Conclusion: 事件相机为下一代高效、低延迟的反无人机系统提供了强大基础。

Abstract: The diffusion of drones presents significant security and safety challenges.
Traditional surveillance systems, particularly conventional frame-based
cameras, struggle to reliably detect these targets due to their small size,
high agility, and the resulting motion blur and poor performance in challenging
lighting conditions. This paper surveys the emerging field of event-based
vision as a robust solution to these problems. Event cameras virtually
eliminate motion blur and enable consistent detection in extreme lighting.
Their sparse, asynchronous output suppresses static backgrounds, enabling
low-latency focus on motion cues. We review the state-of-the-art in event-based
drone detection, from data representation methods to advanced processing
pipelines using spiking neural networks. The discussion extends beyond simple
detection to cover more sophisticated tasks such as real-time tracking,
trajectory forecasting, and unique identification through propeller signature
analysis. By examining current methodologies, available datasets, and the
distinct advantages of the technology, this work demonstrates that event-based
vision provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of reliable,
low-latency, and efficient counter-UAV systems.

Result: 实验表明该方法在牙齿对齐中有效且优越。

Conclusion: TAlignDiff在正畸治疗中具有潜力。

Abstract: Orthodontic treatment hinges on tooth alignment, which significantly affects
occlusal function, facial aesthetics, and patients' quality of life. Current
deep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation
matrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth
alignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the
anatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular
distribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric
constraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new
automatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by
diffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main
components: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a
diffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD).
Geometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level
alignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of
transformation matrices from clinical data. We integrate point cloud-based
transformation regression and diffusion-based transformation modeling into a
unified framework, allowing bidirectional feedback between geometric
constraints and diffusion refinement. Extensive ablation and comparative
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method,
highlighting its potential in orthodontic treatment.

Abstract: This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for
diffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a
conditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a
dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding
(capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global
temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire
streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which
leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline
propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI
datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two
well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and
TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current
state-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight
DDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning
varying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types.
Collectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography,
presenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad
dMRI applications. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像中异常定位问题，现有通用VLM在医学领域表现不佳，而专业医学VLM需大量标注和计算资源。

Method: 将临床概念分解为视觉属性（如形状、密度等），并用指令式提示指导区域-文本对齐训练。

Result: 仅用1.5%数据训练的紧凑模型（0.23B和2B参数）性能优于7B+医学VLM，mAP50提升9.82%。

Conclusion: K2Sight通过结合领域知识和空间结构，实现了数据高效训练，性能显著提升。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical
images, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual
descriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural
grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,
compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual
patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale
domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational
resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Knowledge to Sight
(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by
decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as
shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from
domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which
guide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level
supervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial
structure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact
models with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\% of the data required by
state-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training
data, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical
VLMs, with up to 9.82\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$. Code and models:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于多类皮肤病分类的深度学习框架，评估了三种图像预处理技术，并比较了多种预训练模型的性能。结果表明，DinoV2结合RGB预处理效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病分类因类间相似性和类内变异性而具有挑战性，需探索有效的预处理和模型选择以提高自动化诊断系统的性能。

Method: 系统评估了RGB、CMY和CLAHE三种预处理技术，并测试了DenseNet201、Efficient-NetB5、ViT、Swin Transformer和DinoV2等模型的性能。

Result: DinoV2结合RGB预处理取得了最高准确率（93%）和F1分数，Grad-CAM可视化进一步验证了其精确的病变定位能力。

Conclusion: 有效的预处理和模型选择对构建稳健且可解释的皮肤病CAD系统至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate skin disease classification is a critical yet challenging task due
to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and complex lesion
textures. While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have
shown promise in automating dermatological assessments, their performance is
highly dependent on image pre-processing and model architecture. This study
proposes a deep learning framework for multi-class skin disease classification,
systematically evaluating three image pre-processing techniques: standard RGB,
CMY color space transformation, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE). We benchmark the performance of pre-trained convolutional
neural networks (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformer-based models
(ViT, Swin Transformer, DinoV2 Large) using accuracy and F1-score as evaluation
metrics. Results show that DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest
accuracy (up to 93%) and F1-scores across all variants. Grad-CAM visualizations
applied to RGB inputs further reveal precise lesion localization, enhancing
interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of effective
pre-processing and model choice in building robust and explainable CAD systems
for dermatology.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在长序列处理或依赖深度传感器和慢速测试时优化的问题，提升3D重建的效率和准确性。

Method: 整合深度估计器到RGB-D SLAM系统，利用3D高斯映射解决几何细节不准确问题，结合前馈循环预测模块和局部图渲染技术。

Result: 在Replica和TUM-RGBD数据集上表现优异，跟踪时间减少90%以上，性能与SplaTAM相当。

Conclusion: 该方法通过快速网络推断替代慢速优化，显著提升了3D重建的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream
is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on
input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and
visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences
or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we
first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach
is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further
investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this
problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using
3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction
module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces
slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly
improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering
technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental
results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world
deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with
the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

TL;DR: OmniDepth是一个统一框架，通过迭代双向对齐单目和立体深度估计的潜在表示，结合两者的优势，解决各自局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目方法缺乏几何精度，立体方法在反射或无纹理表面存在模糊性，两者在实践中仍分离。OmniDepth旨在通过统一框架结合两者优势。

Method: 采用迭代双向对齐机制，动态同步单目上下文线索与立体假设表示，解决模糊性问题并优化深度估计。

Result: OmniDepth在Middlebury和ETH3D上零样本泛化误差降低>40%，解决了透明和反射表面的长期问题。

Conclusion: OmniDepth通过结合多视图几何与单目上下文，实现了超越单一模态限制的鲁棒3D感知。

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths:
monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision,
while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with
ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc
synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce
OmniDepth, a unified framework that bridges both through iterative
bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel
cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular
contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning.
This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by
injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo
geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art results: \textbf{OmniDepth reduces zero-shot generalization
error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding
failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view
geometry with monocular context, OmniDepth enables robust 3D perception that
transcends modality-specific limitations. Codes available at

Result: 实验表明，分别处理左右耳可显著提升性能，并通过消融研究提供了实用建议。

Conclusion: 双耳对称性对CNN耳部识别有重要影响，分别处理左右耳能优化性能。

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to
the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability
of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely
adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming
traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry
on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent
studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences
the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop
an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or
right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during
both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five
datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately
during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.
Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and
various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training
CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher
verification rates.

Abstract: We present FinMMR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark tailored to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
in financial numerical reasoning tasks. Compared to existing benchmarks, our
work introduces three significant advancements. (1) Multimodality: We
meticulously transform existing financial reasoning benchmarks, and construct
novel questions from the latest Chinese financial research reports. FinMMR
comprises 4.3K questions and 8.7K images spanning 14 categories, including
tables, bar charts, and ownership structure charts. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinMMR encompasses 14 financial subdomains, including corporate finance,
banking, and industry analysis, significantly exceeding existing benchmarks in
financial domain knowledge breadth. (3) Challenge: Models are required to
perform multi-step precise numerical reasoning by integrating financial
knowledge with the understanding of complex financial images and text. The
best-performing MLLM achieves only 53.0% accuracy on Hard problems. We believe
that FinMMR will drive advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了EncQA基准测试，用于评估多模态视觉语言模型在图表理解中的视觉推理能力，发现模型性能在不同编码和任务间差异显著，且模型规模并非性能提升的关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在图表理解基准测试中的进步未能全面覆盖视觉推理能力，需要更系统的评估方法。

Method: 提出EncQA基准测试，包含2,076个合成问题-答案对，覆盖6种视觉编码和8种任务，评估了9种先进模型。

Result: 模型性能在相同任务的不同编码间及不同任务间差异显著，模型规模对许多任务-编码组合的性能提升无显著影响。

Conclusion: 提升图表理解能力需针对特定视觉推理差距的策略，而非单纯扩大模型或数据集规模。

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving
scores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does
not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for
interpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the
visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual
encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA
provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of
six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color
nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find
anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value
relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9
state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across
encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to
expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for
many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart
understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning
gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.

Motivation: 粗粒度房间布局估计为下游任务提供重要几何线索，但现有方法多基于单视图且假设全景图像。

Method: 通过端到端训练优化密集深度特征的多视图对齐，学习具有大收敛域和平滑损失景观的特征图。

Result: 在ScanNet++和2D-3D-Semantics新基准上验证，显著优于竞争方法。

Conclusion: PixCuboid灵活性强，可扩展至多房间估计，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: Coarse room layout estimation provides important geometric cues for many
downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on
single views and often assume panoramic images. We introduce PixCuboid, an
optimization-based approach for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation, which is
based on multi-view alignment of dense deep features. By training with the
optimization end-to-end, we learn feature maps that yield large convergence
basins and smooth loss landscapes in the alignment. This allows us to
initialize the room layout using simple heuristics.
  For the evaluation we propose two new benchmarks based on ScanNet++ and
2D-3D-Semantics, with manually verified ground truth 3D cuboids. In thorough
experiments we validate our approach and significantly outperform the
competition. Finally, while our network is trained with single cuboids, the
flexibility of the optimization-based approach allow us to easily extend to
multi-room estimation, e.g. larger apartments or offices. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/ghanning/PixCuboid.

TL;DR: ANPrompt是一种新的提示调优框架，旨在增强视觉语言模型（VLMs）对弱语义扰动的鲁棒性，通过生成抗噪声提示和噪声感知视觉提示原型，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示调优方法对弱语义扰动（如图像或文本噪声）的鲁棒性不足，影响了模型对未见类别的泛化能力。

Method: ANPrompt通过融合原始和噪声扰动的文本嵌入生成噪声提示，并结合可学习提示令牌生成抗噪声提示，同时计算噪声抵抗视觉提示原型（NRVPP）和引入弱语义噪声对齐损失（WALoss）。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，ANPrompt显著优于现有方法，表现出对语义噪声的更强鲁棒性和对新类别的更好泛化能力。

Conclusion: ANPrompt通过创新的抗噪声提示设计和噪声感知目标，有效提升了提示调优的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for
adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead.
However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs
to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade
their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose
ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under
such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by
fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered
to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt
tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper
layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware
visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype
(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,
ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by
computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard
cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that
ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving
superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel
categories.

Abstract: Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is
important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with
efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction
category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person
acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and
egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the
manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the
assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and
commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors
engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts.
Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale
human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of
multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate
human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel
benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and
interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our
InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI

Abstract: End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in
improving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains
challenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work,
we introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for
multi-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components:
a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction
learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict
suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the
need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines,
substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate
TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and
demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that
pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and
significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced
multi-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.

Motivation: BEV感知在自动驾驶中至关重要，但现有研究主要集中在BEV编码器和任务特定头上，忽略了表示学习的潜力。

Method: BEVCon引入两个对比学习模块：实例特征对比模块和视角对比模块，结合检测损失进行密集对比学习。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，BEVCon实现了最高2.4% mAP的性能提升。

Conclusion: BEVCon证明了表示学习在BEV感知中的重要性，为传统任务特定优化提供了补充途径。

Abstract: We present BEVCon, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework
designed to improve Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving. BEV
perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding
environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and
trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on
enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored
potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two
contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining
BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image
backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses
leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the
backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon
achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement
over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of
representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to
conventional task-specific optimizations.

Motivation: 解决多帧输入下3D占用预测的高处理成本和时空不一致性问题。

Result: 在3D占用预测任务中，性能提升3 mIoU，时间不一致性降低29%。

Conclusion: ST-Occ通过时空特征学习和一致性建模，显著提升了3D占用预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: 3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous
driving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,
it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across
multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and
dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level
occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the
spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core
designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical
information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and
a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the
spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our
method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D
occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between
multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal
inconsistency by 29%.

Abstract: Entity resolution (ER) remains a significant challenge in data management,
especially when dealing with large datasets. This paper introduces MERAI
(Massive Entity Resolution using AI), a robust and efficient pipeline designed
to address record deduplication and linkage issues in high-volume datasets at
an enterprise level. The pipeline's resilience and accuracy have been validated
through various large-scale record deduplication and linkage projects. To
evaluate MERAI's performance, we compared it with two well-known entity

million records due to memory constraints, MERAI successfully processed
datasets of up to 15.7 million records and produced accurate results across all
experiments. Experimental data demonstrates that MERAI outperforms both
baseline systems in terms of matching accuracy, with consistently higher F1
scores in both deduplication and record linkage tasks. MERAI offers a scalable

TL;DR: Raqlet是一个源到源编译框架，用于解决递归查询引擎在关系型、图型和演绎型系统中的碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SQL:2023的SQL/PGQ和GQL标准在实际系统中的支持不一致，Raqlet旨在通过中间表示（IR）提供跨范式的递归查询翻译。

Method: Raqlet通过将Cypher或SQL/PGQ转换为PGIR，再转为DLIR，最后转为SQIR，实现跨范式翻译。

Result: Raqlet提供了一个共享的语义基础，可作为语言标准的参考实现，并支持静态分析和性能优化。

Conclusion: Raqlet的目标是成为一个强大的平台，支持跨范式原型设计、可移植的递归查询和形式化推理。

Abstract: We introduce Raqlet, a source-to-source compilation framework that addresses
the fragmentation of recursive querying engines spanning relational (recursive
SQL), graph (Cypher, GQL), and deductive (Datalog) systems. Recent standards
such as SQL:2023's SQL/PGQ and the GQL standard provide a common foundation for
querying graph data within relational and graph databases; however, real-world
support remains inconsistent across systems. Raqlet bridges this gap by
translating recursive queries across paradigms through leveraging intermediate
representations (IRs) grounded in well-defined semantics; it translates Cypher
or SQL/PGQ to PGIR (inspired by Cypher), then into DLIR (inspired by Datalog),
and finally to SQIR (inspired by recursive SQL). Raqlet provides a shared
semantic basis that can serve as a golden reference implementation for language
standards, while supporting static analysis and transformations (e.g.,
magic-set transformation) for performance tuning. Our vision is to make Raqlet
a robust platform that enables rapid cross-paradigm prototyping, portable
recursive queries, and formal reasoning about recursion even when targeting
diverse query execution engines.

TL;DR: BridgeScope是一个通用工具包，通过模块化SQL操作、对齐数据库权限与安全策略以及引入代理机制，解决了LLM与数据库交互中的可用性、安全性和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM与数据库的交互设计存在可用性、安全性、权限管理和数据传输效率的局限性，亟需一种更高效、安全的解决方案。

Method: BridgeScope通过模块化SQL操作、对齐数据库权限与安全策略、引入代理机制，实现了更精确的功能控制和高效数据传输。

Result: 评估显示，BridgeScope显著提升了LLM代理操作数据库的效率，减少了80%的令牌使用，并支持数据密集型工作流。

Conclusion: BridgeScope为下一代智能数据自动化提供了强大基础，解决了现有工具包的不足。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly powerful reasoning
and orchestration capabilities, LLM-based agents are rapidly proliferating for
complex data-related tasks. Despite this progress, the current design of how
LLMs interact with databases exhibits critical limitations in usability,
security, privilege management, and data transmission efficiency. To resolve
these challenges, we introduce BridgeScope, a universal toolkit bridging LLMs
and databases through three key innovations. First, it modularizes SQL
operations into fine-grained tools for context retrieval, CRUD execution, and
ACID-compliant transaction management, enabling more precise and LLM-friendly
functionality controls. Second, it aligns tool implementations with both
database privileges and user security policies to steer LLMs away from unsafe
or unauthorized operations, improving task execution efficiency while
safeguarding database security. Third, it introduces a proxy mechanism for
seamless inter-tool data transfer, bypassing LLM transmission bottlenecks. All
of these designs are database-agnostic and can be transparently integrated with
existing agent architectures. We also release an open-source implementation of
BridgeScope for PostgreSQL. Evaluations on two novel benchmarks demonstrate
that BridgeScope enables LLM agents to operate databases more effectively,
reduces token usage by up to 80% through improved security awareness, and
uniquely supports data-intensive workflows beyond existing toolkits,
establishing BridgeScope as a robust foundation for next-generation intelligent
data automation.

Motivation: 硬件（如GPU内存增大、互联和IO加速）和软件（如可组合数据系统和成熟库）的进步消除了GPU数据分析广泛采用的主要障碍。

Method: 提出Sirius，一个GPU原生SQL引擎，利用libcudf等库实现高性能关系操作，并通过Substrait查询表示无缝集成现有数据库。

Result: 在TPC-H测试中，Sirius与DuckDB集成单节点提速7倍，与Apache Doris集成分布式环境提速12.5倍。

Conclusion: GPU数据分析的硬件和软件条件已成熟，Sirius展示了GPU在数据系统中的高效潜力。

Abstract: The era of GPU-powered data analytics has arrived. In this paper, we argue
that recent advances in hardware (e.g., larger GPU memory, faster interconnect
and IO, and declining cost) and software (e.g., composable data systems and
mature libraries) have removed the key barriers that have limited the wider
adoption of GPU data analytics. We present Sirius, a prototype open-source
GPU-native SQL engine that offers drop-in acceleration for diverse data
systems. Sirius treats GPU as the primary engine and leverages libraries like
libcudf for high-performance relational operators. It provides drop-in
acceleration for existing databases by leveraging the standard Substrait query
representation, replacing the CPU engine without changing the user-facing
interface. On TPC-H, Sirius achieves 7x speedup when integrated with DuckDB in
a single node at the same hardware rental cost, and up to 12.5x speedup when
integrated with Apache Doris in a distributed setting.

TL;DR: FlashCommunication V2是一种新型通信范式，通过位拆分和尖峰保留技术解决低比特量化问题，显著提升分布式训练中LLM的通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式训练和部署大型语言模型（LLM）时，通信瓶颈成为关键挑战，需要高效的跨GPU传输解决方案。

Method: 提出位拆分技术将不规则比特宽度分解为基本单元，确保硬件兼容性；尖峰保留技术保留数值异常值以缩小动态范围，支持低至2比特的量化。

Result: 在NVLink和PCIe架构下，实现了AllReduce最高3.2倍加速和All2All通信2倍加速。

Conclusion: FlashCommunication V2通过软硬件协同设计，显著提升了通信系统的灵活性和资源利用率。

Abstract: Nowadays, communication bottlenecks have emerged as a critical challenge in
the distributed training and deployment of large language models (LLMs). This
paper introduces FlashCommunication V2, a novel communication paradigm enabling
efficient cross-GPU transmission at arbitrary bit widths. Its core innovations
lie in the proposed bit splitting and spike reserving techniques, which address
the challenges of low-bit quantization. Bit splitting decomposes irregular bit
widths into basic units, ensuring compatibility with hardware capabilities and
thus enabling transmission at any bit width. Spike reserving, on the other
hand, retains numerical outliers (i.e., minima and maxima) as floating-point
numbers, which shrinks the dynamic numerical range and pushes the quantization
limits to 2-bit with acceptable losses. FlashCommunication V2 significantly
enhances the flexibility and resource utilization of communication systems.
Through meticulous software-hardware co-design, it delivers robust performance
and reduced overhead across both NVLink-based and PCIe-based architectures,
achieving a maximum 3.2$\times$ speedup in AllReduce and 2$\times$ in All2All
communication.

Conclusion: 该方法为推荐模型训练设定了新的技术标杆，解决了大规模并行训练中的关键问题。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) has
led to a growing need for large-scale distributed systems that can efficiently
train vast amounts of data. In DLRM, the sparse embedding table is a crucial
component for managing sparse categorical features. Typically, these tables in
industrial DLRMs contain trillions of parameters, necessitating model
parallelism strategies to address memory constraints. However, as training
systems expand with massive GPUs, the traditional fully parallelism strategies
for embedding table post significant scalability challenges, including
imbalance and straggler issues, intensive lookup communication, and heavy
embedding activation memory. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
two-dimensional sparse parallelism approach. Rather than fully sharding tables
across all GPUs, our solution introduces data parallelism on top of model
parallelism. This enables efficient all-to-all communication and reduces peak
memory consumption. Additionally, we have developed the momentum-scaled
row-wise AdaGrad algorithm to mitigate performance losses associated with the
shift in training paradigms. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach significantly enhances training efficiency while maintaining
model performance parity. It achieves nearly linear training speed scaling up
to 4K GPUs, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark for recommendation model
training.

Conclusion: RSPC通过信誉分区和四阶段确认协议，有效解决了群智感知的安全和可扩展性问题，为数据驱动应用提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: With the popularity of smart terminals, such as the Internet of Things,
crowdsensing is an emerging data aggregation paradigm, which plays a pivotal
role in data-driven applications. There are some key issues in the development
of crowdsensing such as platform security and privacy protection. As the
crowdsensing is usually managed by a centralized platform, centralized
management will bring various security vulnerabilities and scalability issues.
To solve these issues, an effective reputation-based partition scheme (RSPC) is
proposed in this article. The partition scheme calculates the optimal partition
size by combining the node reputation value and divides the node into several
disjoint partitions according to the node reputation value. By selecting the
appropriate partition size, RSPC provides a mechanism to ensure that each
partition is valid, as long as themaximum permissible threshold for the failed
node is observed. At the same time, the RSPC reorganizes the network
periodically to avoid partition attacks. In addition, for cross-partition
transactions, this paper innovatively proposes a four-stage confirmation
protocol to ensure the efficient and safe completion of cross-partition
transactions. Finally, experiments show that RSPC improves scalability, low
latency, and high throughput for crowdsensing.

emulation achieves more than 2x higher performance and superior power
efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于DAG的ADR协议，旨在解决区块链的吞吐量、可扩展性和延迟问题，特别适用于物联网应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前区块链系统在吞吐量、可扩展性和延迟方面存在局限性，尤其是在共识机制和节点身份管理上，限制了其在物联网等领域的应用。

Method: ADR协议采用DAG结构，通过三步法（节点验证、DAG账本构建和节点排名）提升网络安全性、吞吐量和可扩展性。

Result: 在Amazon EC2集群上的实验表明，ADR显著提升了交易吞吐量和网络活性，优于现有的DAG区块链（如IOTA和ByteBall）。

Conclusion: ADR协议为区块链在物联网等领域的应用提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In the past decade, blockchain has emerged as a promising solution for
building secure distributed ledgers and has attracted significant attention.
However, current blockchain systems suffer from limited throughput, poor
scalability, and high latency. Due to limitations in consensus mechanisms,
especially in managing node identities, blockchain is often considered
unsuitable for applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper
proposes the Advanced DAG-based Ranking (ADR) protocol to enhance blockchain
scalability and throughput. ADR employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
structure where nodes are positioned based on their rankings. Unlike
traditional chains, ADR allows honest nodes to write blocks and verify
transactions using a DAG-based topology. The protocol follows a three-step
approach to secure the network against double-spending and enhance performance.
First, it verifies nodes using their public and private keys before granting
entry. Second, it builds an advanced DAG ledger enabling block production and
transaction validation. Third, a ranking algorithm filters out malicious nodes,
ranks the remaining nodes based on performance, and arranges them
topologically. This process increases throughput and ensures robust
scalability. We evaluated ADR on Amazon EC2 clusters with over 100 nodes,
including scenarios with injected malicious nodes. Simulation results
demonstrate that ADR significantly improves transaction throughput and network
liveness compared to existing DAG-based blockchains such as IOTA and ByteBall,
making it well-suited for IoT applications.

Abstract: We recognize the emergence of a statistical computing community focused on
working with large computing platforms and producing software and applications
that exemplify high-performance statistical computing (HPSC). The statistical
computing (SC) community develops software that is widely used across
disciplines. However, it remains largely absent from the high-performance
computing (HPC) landscape, particularly on platforms such as those featured on
the Top500 or Green500 lists. Many disciplines already participate in HPC,
mostly centered around simulation science, although data-focused efforts under
the artificial intelligence (AI) label are gaining popularity. Bridging this
gap requires both community adaptation and technical innovation to align
statistical methods with modern HPC technologies. We can accelerate progress in
fast and scalable statistical applications by building strong connections
between the SC and HPC communities. We present a brief history of SC, a vision
for how its strengths can contribute to statistical science in the HPC
environment (such as HPSC), the challenges that remain, and the opportunities
currently available, culminating in a possible roadmap toward a thriving HPSC
community.

Motivation: 随着物联网数据的快速增长，将所有数据传输到云端进行分析成本高昂且资源密集，边缘计算成为解决方案。

Method: 利用天际线候选集在并行边缘计算节点上修剪不太可能成为天际线的数据，减少数据传输量。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法在处理二维数据时延迟减少50%以上，在高维数据上也优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EPUS算法有效降低了数据传输量和云端计算资源需求，适用于低延迟物联网分析应用。

Abstract: Due to the Internet of Everything (IoE), data generated in our life become
larger. As a result, we need more effort to analyze the data and extract
valuable information. In the cloud computing environment, all data analysis is
done in the cloud, and the client only needs less computing power to handle
some simple tasks. However, with the rapid increase in data volume, sending all
data to the cloud via the Internet has become more expensive. The required
cloud computing resources have also become larger. To solve this problem, edge
computing is proposed. Edge is granted with more computation power to process
data before sending it to the cloud. Therefore, the data transmitted over the
Internet and the computing resources required by the cloud can be effectively
reduced. In this work, we proposed an Edge-assisted Parallel Uncertain Skyline
(EPUS) algorithm for emerging low-latency IoE analytic applications. We use the
concept of skyline candidate set to prune data that are less likely to become
the skyline data on the parallel edge computing nodes. With the candidate
skyline set, each edge computing node only sends the information required to
the server for updating the global skyline, which reduces the amount of data
that transfer over the internet. According to the simulation results, the
proposed method is better than two comparative methods, which reduces the
latency of processing two-dimensional data by more than 50%. For
high-dimensional data, the proposed EPUS method also outperforms the other
existing methods.

Motivation: 联邦学习在分散数据上协作训练模型，但易受梯度泄漏攻击，现有防御机制（如差分隐私和同态加密）在异构环境中面临隐私、效用和开销的权衡问题。

Method: SelectiveShield利用Fisher信息量化参数敏感性，通过协作协商协议选择敏感参数进行同态加密保护，非关键参数则采用自适应差分隐私噪声。

Result: 实验表明，SelectiveShield在保持模型效用的同时显著降低梯度泄漏风险，适用于实际联邦学习部署。

Conclusion: SelectiveShield提供了一种实用且可扩展的防御机制，适用于异构联邦学习环境。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized
data but remains vulnerable to gradient leakage attacks that can reconstruct
sensitive user information. Existing defense mechanisms, such as differential
privacy (DP) and homomorphic encryption (HE), often introduce a trade-off
between privacy, model utility, and system overhead, a challenge that is
exacerbated in heterogeneous environments with non-IID data and varying client
capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose SelectiveShield, a
lightweight hybrid defense framework that adaptively integrates selective
homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. SelectiveShield leverages
Fisher information to quantify parameter sensitivity, allowing clients to
identify critical parameters locally. Through a collaborative negotiation
protocol, clients agree on a shared set of the most sensitive parameters for
protection via homomorphic encryption. Parameters that are uniquely important
to individual clients are retained locally, fostering personalization, while
non-critical parameters are protected with adaptive differential privacy noise.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelectiveShield maintains strong model
utility while significantly mitigating gradient leakage risks, offering a
practical and scalable defense mechanism for real-world federated learning
deployments.

Conclusion: S2M3在资源受限设备上高效支持多任务推理，优于云端AI。

Abstract: With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards multiple
modalities (language, vision, speech, etc.), multi-modal models have
increasingly been used across various applications (e.g., visual question
answering or image generation/captioning). Despite the success of AI as a
service for multi-modal applications, it relies heavily on clouds, which are
constrained by bandwidth, latency, privacy concerns, and unavailability under
network or server failures. While on-device AI becomes popular, supporting
multiple tasks on edge devices imposes significant resource challenges. To
address this, we introduce S2M3, a split-and-share multi-modal architecture for
multi-task inference on edge devices. Inspired by the general-purpose nature of
multi-modal models, which are composed of multiple modules (encoder, decoder,
classifier, etc.), we propose to split multi-modal models at functional-level
modules; and then share common modules to reuse them across tasks, thereby
reducing resource usage. To address cross-model dependency arising from module
sharing, we propose a greedy module-level placement with per-request parallel
routing by prioritizing compute-intensive modules. Through experiments on a
testbed consisting of 14 multi-modal models across 5 tasks and 10 benchmarks,
we demonstrate that S2M3 can reduce memory usage by up to 50% and 62% in
single-task and multi-task settings, respectively, without sacrificing
accuracy. Furthermore, S2M3 achieves optimal placement in 89 out of 95
instances (93.7%) while reducing inference latency by up to 56.9% on
resource-constrained devices, compared to cloud AI.

Abstract: As computing energy demand continues to grow and electrical grid
infrastructure struggles to keep pace, an increasing number of data centers are
being planned with colocated microgrids that integrate on-site renewable
generation and energy storage. However, while existing research has examined
the tradeoffs between operational and embodied carbon emissions in the context
of renewable energy certificates, there is a lack of tools to assess how the
sizing and composition of microgrid components affects long-term sustainability
and power reliability.
  In this paper, we present a novel optimization framework that extends the
computing and energy system co-simulator Vessim with detailed renewable energy
generation models from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) System
Advisor Model (SAM). Our framework simulates the interaction between computing
workloads, on-site renewable production, and energy storage, capturing both
operational and embodied emissions. We use a multi-horizon black-box
optimization to explore efficient microgrid compositions and enable operators
to make more informed decisions when planning energy systems for data centers.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices produces massive,
heterogeneous data streams, demanding scalable and efficient scheduling in
cloud environments to meet latency, energy, and Quality-of-Service (QoS)
requirements. Existing scheduling methods often lack adaptability to dynamic
workloads and network variability inherent in IoT-cloud systems. This paper
presents a novel hybrid scheduling algorithm combining deep Reinforcement
Learning (RL) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to address these challenges.
The deep RL agent utilizes a model-free policy-gradient approach to learn
adaptive task allocation policies responsive to real-time workload fluctuations
and network states. Simultaneously, the ACO metaheuristic conducts a global
combinatorial search to optimize resource distribution, mitigate congestion,
and balance load across distributed cloud nodes. Extensive experiments on
large-scale synthetic IoT datasets, reflecting diverse workloads and QoS
constraints, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 18.4%
reduction in average response time, 12.7% improvement in resource utilization,
and 9.3% decrease in energy consumption compared to leading heuristics and
RL-only baselines. Moreover, the algorithm ensures strict Service Level
Agreement (SLA) compliance through deadline-aware scheduling and dynamic
prioritization. The results confirm the effectiveness of integrating model-free
RL with swarm intelligence for scalable, energy-efficient IoT data scheduling,
offering a promising approach for next-generation IoT-cloud platforms.

performance. To resolve this, we present a Context-Aware Smart Handover (CASH)
protocol that uses a forward-looking scoring mechanism based on UAV trajectory
to make proactive handover decisions. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed CASH against existing handover protocols in a custom-built simulator.
Results show that CASH reduces handover frequency by up to 78% while
maintaining low outage probability. We then investigate the impact of base
station density and safety margin on handover performance, where their optimal
setups are empirically obtained to ensure reliable UAM communication.

Abstract: Accurately classifying the application types of network traffic using deep
learning models has recently gained popularity. However, we find that these
classifiers do not perform well on real-world traffic data due to the presence
of non-application-specific generic background traffic originating from
advertisements, analytics, shared APIs, and trackers. Unfortunately,
state-of-the-art application classifiers overlook such traffic in curated
datasets and only classify relevant application traffic. To address this issue,
when we label and train using an additional class for background traffic, it
leads to additional confusion between application and background traffic, as
the latter is heterogeneous and encompasses all traffic that is not relevant to
the application sessions. To avoid falsely classifying background traffic as
one of the relevant application types, a reliable confidence measure is
warranted, such that we can refrain from classifying uncertain samples.
Therefore, we design a Gaussian Mixture Model-based classification framework
that improves the indication of the deep learning classifier's confidence to
allow more reliable classification.

Abstract: Evaluating cellular systems, from 5G New Radio (NR) and 5G-Advanced to 6G, is
challenging because the performance emerges from the tight coupling of
propagation, beam management, scheduling, and higher-layer interactions.
System-level simulation is therefore indispensable, yet the vast majority of
studies rely on the statistical 3GPP channel models. These are well suited to
capture average behavior across many statistical realizations, but cannot
reproduce site-specific phenomena such as corner diffraction, street-canyon
blockage, or deterministic line-of-sight conditions and
angle-of-departure/arrival relationships that drive directional links. This
paper extends 5G-LENA, an NR module for the system-level Network Simulator 3
(ns-3), with a trace-based channel model that processes the Multipath
Components (MPCs) obtained from external ray-tracers (e.g., Sionna Ray Tracer
(RT)) or measurement campaigns. Our module constructs frequency-domain channel
matrices and feeds them to the existing Physical (PHY)/Medium Access Control
(MAC) stack without any further modifications. The result is a geometry-based
channel model that remains fully compatible with the standard 3GPP
implementation in 5G-LENA, while delivering site-specific geometric fidelity.
This new module provides a key building block toward Digital Twin (DT)
capabilities by offering realistic site-specific channel modeling, unlocking
studies that require site awareness, including beam management, blockage
mitigation, and environment-aware sensing. We demonstrate its capabilities for
precise beam-steering validation and end-to-end metric analysis. In both cases,
the trace-driven engine exposes performance inflections that the statistical
model does not exhibit, confirming its value for high-fidelity system-level
cellular networks research and as a step toward DT applications.

Motivation: 大规模人工智能和数据密集型应用的普及推动了计算能力网络（CPN）的发展，但其高能耗和电力系统中可再生能源的不稳定性带来了双重挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段优化框架：日前随机机组组合（SUC）阶段和实时运行阶段。前者使用Benders分解提高计算效率，后者通过深度强化学习（DRL）代理实现碳感知任务调度。

Result: 在IEEE 30节点系统上的仿真表明，TSCO框架显著减少了碳排放和运营成本，同时将可再生能源弃电量降低60%以上，并保持计算任务的服务质量。

Conclusion: TSCO框架为CPN和电力系统的协同优化提供了有效解决方案，实现了低碳、高效和稳定的运营。

Abstract: The proliferation of large-scale artificial intelligence and data-intensive
applications has spurred the development of Computing Power Networks (CPNs),
which promise to deliver ubiquitous and on-demand computational resources.
However, the immense energy consumption of these networks poses a significant
sustainability challenge. Simultaneously, power grids are grappling with the
instability introduced by the high penetration of intermittent renewable energy
sources (RES). This paper addresses these dual challenges through a novel
Two-Stage Co-Optimization (TSCO) framework that synergistically manages power
system dispatch and CPN task scheduling to achieve low-carbon operations. The
framework decomposes the complex, large-scale problem into a day-ahead
stochastic unit commitment (SUC) stage and a real-time operational stage. The
former is solved using Benders decomposition for computational tractability,
while in the latter, economic dispatch of generation assets is coupled with an
adaptive CPN task scheduling managed by a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
agent. This agent makes intelligent, carbon-aware decisions by responding to
dynamic grid conditions, including real-time electricity prices and marginal
carbon intensity. Through extensive simulations on an IEEE 30-bus system
integrated with a CPN, the TSCO framework is shown to significantly outperform
baseline approaches. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces
total carbon emissions and operational costs, while simultaneously decreasing
RES curtailment by more than 60% and maintaining stringent Quality of Service
(QoS) for computational tasks.

tools have become impractical for use in this context.
  We therefore present the Deep Space Network Simulator (DSNS): a new network
simulator with a focus on large-scale satellite networks. We demonstrate its
improved capabilities compared to existing offerings, showcase its flexibility
and extensibility through an implementation of existing protocols and the DTN
simulation reference scenarios recommended by CCSDS, and evaluate its
scalability, showing that it exceeds existing tools while providing better
fidelity.
  DSNS provides concrete usefulness to both standards bodies and satellite
operators, enabling fast iteration on protocol development and testing of
parameters under highly realistic conditions. By removing roadblocks to
research and innovation, we can accelerate the development of upcoming
satellite networks and ensure that their communication is both fast and secure.

the potential of using molecular communication (MC) to address the challenges
in constructing IoBNT for epidemic prevention, specifically focusing on

ORF3a protein as a benchmark. Finally, open research issues are discussed. In
summary, this paper aims to analyze viral transmission through MC and combat
viral spread using signal processing techniques within MC.

Method: 研究零信任分布式网络（ZTDN）的策略设计挑战，并通过UPPAAL进行策略的形式化验证。

Result: 提出了ZTA策略设计在分布式网络中的解决方案，并通过案例研究验证了形式化方法的重要性。

Conclusion: 强调了系统安全中责任与问责的重要性，并展示了形式化验证在策略设计中的价值。

Abstract: Traditional security architectures are becoming more vulnerable to
distributed attacks due to significant dependence on trust. This will further
escalate when implementing agentic AI within the systems, as more components
must be secured over a similar distributed space. These scenarios can be
observed in consumer technologies, such as the dense Internet of things (IoT).
Here, zero-trust architecture (ZTA) can be seen as a potential solution, which
relies on a key principle of not giving users explicit trust, instead always
verifying their privileges whenever a request is made. However, the overall
security in ZTA is managed through its policies, and unverified policies can
lead to unauthorized access. Thus, this paper explores challenges and solutions
for ZTA policy design in the context of distributed networks, which is referred
to as zero-trust distributed networks (ZTDN). This is followed by a case-study
on formal verification of policies using UPPAAL. Subsequently, the importance
of accountability and responsibility in the system's security is discussed.

<details>

Method: 基于文献、语言文档和类型检查器实验，设计If-T基准，包含核心技术维度和正反例程序，评估五种类型检查器。

Result: If-T为类型窄化系统提供基线，揭示不同复杂度的权衡，帮助设计者决定支持哪些功能。

Conclusion: If-T通过公平跨语言评估，为未来类型系统设计在精度、标注负担和性能间找到更好平衡提供工具。

Abstract: **Context:** The design of static type systems that can validate
dynamically-typed programs (**gradually**) is an ongoing challenge. A key
difficulty is that dynamic code rarely follows datatype-driven design. Programs
instead use runtime tests to narrow down the proper usage of incoming data.
Type systems for dynamic languages thus need a **type narrowing** mechanism
that refines the type environment along individual control paths based on
dominating tests, a form of flow-sensitive typing. In order to express
refinements, the type system must have some notion of sets and subsets. Since
set-theoretic types are computationally and ergonomically complex, the need for
type narrowing raises design questions about how to balance precision and
performance. **Inquiry:** To date, the design of type narrowing systems has
been driven by intuition, past experience, and examples from users in various
language communities. There is no standard that captures desirable and
undesirable behaviors. Prior formalizations of narrowing are also significantly
more complex than a standard type system, and it is unclear how the extra
complexity pays off in terms of concrete examples. This paper addresses the
problems through If-T, a language-agnostic **design benchmark** for type
narrowing that characterizes the abilities of implementations using simple
programs that draw attention to fundamental questions. Unlike a traditional
performance-focused benchmark, If-T measures a narrowing system's ability to
validate correct code and reject incorrect code. Unlike a test suite, systems
are not required to fully conform to If-T. Deviations are acceptable provided
they are justified by well-reasoned design considerations, such as compile-time
performance. **Approach:** If-T is guided by the literature on type narrowing,
the documentation of gradual languages such as TypeScript, and experiments with
typechecker implementations. We have identified a set of core technical
dimensions for type narrowing. For each dimension, the benchmark contains a set
of topics and (at least) two characterizing programs per topic: one that should
typecheck and one that should not typecheck. **Knowledge:** If-T provides a
baseline to measure type narrowing systems. For researchers, it provides
criteria to categorize future designs via its collection of positive and
negative examples. For language designers, the benchmark demonstrates the
payoff of typechecker complexity in terms of concrete examples. Designers can
use the examples to decide whether supporting a particular example is
worthwhile. Both the benchmark and its implementations are freely available
online. **Grounding:** We have implemented the benchmark for five typecheckers:
TypeScript, Flow, Typed Racket, mypy, and Pyright. The results highlight
important differences, such as the ability to track logical implications among
program variables and typechecking for user-defined narrowing predicates.
**Importance:** Type narrowing is essential for gradual type systems, but the
tradeoffs between systems with different complexity have been unclear. If-T
clarifies these tradeoffs by illustrating the benefits and limitations of each
level of complexity. With If-T as a way to assess implementations in a fair,
cross-language manner, future type system designs can strive for a better
balance among precision, annotation burden, and performance.

Result: 提出了一种类型系统，集成合规性检查和用户同意变更，并通过示例和证明展示了方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为隐私感知系统设计提供了系统化和自动化的GDPR合规集成方案，适用于医疗和金融等领域。

Abstract: Data protection laws such as GDPR aim to give users unprecedented control
over their personal data. Compliance with these regulations requires
systematically considering information flow and interactions among entities
handling sensitive data. Privacy-by-design principles advocate embedding data
protection into system architectures as a default. However, translating these
abstract principles into concrete, explicit methods remains a significant
challenge. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a language-based approach
to privacy integration, combining static and runtime techniques. By employing
type checking and type inference in an active object language, the framework
enables the tracking of authorised data flows and the automatic generation of
constraints checked at runtime based on user consent. This ensures that
personal data is processed in compliance with GDPR constraints. The key
contribution of this work is a type system that gather the compliance checks
and the changes to users consent and integrates data privacy compliance
verification into system execution. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of
this approach through a soundness proof and several examples, illustrating how
the proposed language addresses common GDPR requirements, such as user consent,
purpose limitation, and data subject rights. This work advances the state of
the art in privacy-aware system design by offering a systematic and automated
method for integrating GDPR compliance into programming languages. This
capability has implications for building trustworthy systems in domains such as
healthcare or finance, where data privacy is crucial.

Abstract: A vast number of software systems include components that parse and process
structured input. In addition to programming languages, which are analyzed by
compilers or interpreters, there are numerous components that process
standardized or proprietary data formats of varying complexity. Even if such
components were initially developed and tested based on a specification, such
as a grammar, numerous modifications and adaptations over the course of
software evolution can make it impossible to precisely determine which inputs
they actually accept. In this situation, grammar mining can be used to
reconstruct the specification in the form of a grammar. Established approaches
already produce useful results, provided that sufficient input data is
available to fully cover the input language. However, achieving this
completeness is a major challenge. In practice, only input data recorded during
the operation of the software systems is available. If this data is used for
grammar mining, the resulting grammar reflects only the actual processed inputs
but not the complete grammar of the input language accepted by the software
component. As a result, edge cases or previously supported features that no
longer appear in the available input data are missing from the generated
grammar. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for
the automatic generation of inputs for grammar mining. Although input
generators have already been used for fuzz testing, it remains unclear whether
they are also suitable for grammar miners. Building on the grammar miner Mimid,
this work presents a fully automated approach to input generation. The approach
leverages Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) and extends it with two mechanisms
to overcome the limitations of DSE regarding structured input parsers. First,
the search for new inputs is guided by an iterative expansion that starts with
a single-character input and gradually extends it. Second, input generation is
structured into a novel three-phase approach, which separates the generation of
inputs for parser functions. The proposed method was evaluated against a
diverse set of eleven benchmark applications from the existing literature.
Results demonstrate that the approach achieves precision and recall for
extracted grammars close to those derived from state-of-the-art grammar miners
such as Mimid. Notably, it successfully uncovers subtle features and edge cases
in parsers that are typically missed by such grammar miners. The effectiveness
of the method is supported by empirical evidence, showing that it can achieve
high performance in various domains without requiring prior input samples. This
contribution is significant for researchers and practitioners in software
engineering, offering an automated, scalable, and precise solution for grammar
mining. By eliminating the need for manual input generation, the approach not
only reduces workload but also enhances the robustness and comprehensiveness of
the extracted grammars. Following this approach, software engineers can
reconstruct specification from existing (legacy) parsers.

Conclusion: 弱内存模型的规范化研究对开发安全关键软件至关重要，未来仍需进一步探索。

Abstract: Memory consistency models define the order in which accesses to shared memory
in a concurrent system may be observed to occur. Such models are a necessity
since program order is not a reliable indicator of execution order, due to
microarchitectural features or compiler transformations. Concurrent
programming, already a challenging task, is thus made even harder when weak
memory effects must be addressed. A rigorous specification of weak memory
models is therefore essential to make this problem tractable for developers of
safety- and security-critical, low-level software.
  In this paper we survey the field of formalisations of weak memory models,
including their specification, their effects on execution, and tools and
inference systems for reasoning about code. To assist the discussion we also
provide an introduction to two styles of formal representation found commonly
in the literature (using a much simplified version of Intel's x86 as the
example): a step-by-step construction of traces of the system (operational
semantics); and with respect to relations between memory events (axiomatic
semantics). The survey covers some long-standing hardware features that lead to
observable weak behaviours, a description of historical developments in
practice and in theory, an overview of computability and complexity results,
and outlines current and future directions in the field.

Abstract: Empathy is a powerful yet often overlooked element in software engineering

decision-making. In our previous study, we identified a range of practitioner
strategies for fostering empathy in SE contexts. Building on these insights,
this paper introduces 17 actionable empathy guidelines designed to support
practitioners, teams, and organisations. We also explore how these guidelines
can be implemented in practice by examining real-world applications,
challenges, and strategies to overcome them shared by software practitioners.
To support adoption, we present a visual prioritisation framework that
categorises the guidelines based on perceived importance, ease of
implementation, and willingness to adopt. The findings offer practical and
flexible suggestions for integrating empathy into everyday SE work, helping
teams move from principles to sustainable action.

Abstract: The security of research software is essential for ensuring the integrity and

still largely unexplored. Due to its dependence on open source components and
distributed development practices, research software is particularly vulnerable
to supply chain attacks. This study analyses 3,248 high-quality, largely
peer-reviewed research software repositories using the OpenSSF Scorecard. We
find a generally weak security posture with an average score of 3.5/10.
Important practices, such as signed releases and branch protection, are rarely
implemented. Finally, we present actionable, low-effort recommendations that
can help research teams improve software security and mitigate potential
threats to scientific integrity.

*Martin Obaidi,Kushtrim Qengaj,Jakob Droste,Hannah Deters,Marc Herrmann,Jil Klünder,Elisa Schmid,Kurt Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现，应用属性与用户解释需求之间的关联较弱，仅少数属性（如应用版本、评论数量和星级）有中等相关性。线性回归模型的预测能力有限，无法可靠预测解释需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过应用属性预测用户解释需求，以支持开发早期和大规模需求挖掘。

Method: 分析了4,495条应用评论的黄金标准数据集，并进行了相关性分析和线性回归建模。

Result: 解释需求高度依赖上下文，无法仅通过应用元数据精确推断。部分类别（如安全与隐私、系统行为）预测潜力略高。

Conclusion: 开发者应结合元数据分析和直接用户反馈，以设计更易解释和用户中心的软件系统。

Abstract: In today's digitized world, software systems must support users in
understanding both how to interact with a system and why certain behaviors
occur. This study investigates whether explanation needs, classified from user
reviews, can be predicted based on app properties, enabling early consideration
during development and large-scale requirements mining. We analyzed a gold
standard dataset of 4,495 app reviews enriched with metadata (e.g., app
version, ratings, age restriction, in-app purchases). Correlation analyses
identified mostly weak associations between app properties and explanation
needs, with moderate correlations only for specific features such as app
version, number of reviews, and star ratings. Linear regression models showed
limited predictive power, with no reliable forecasts across configurations.
Validation on a manually labeled dataset of 495 reviews confirmed these
findings. Categories such as Security & Privacy and System Behavior showed
slightly higher predictive potential, while Interaction and User Interface
remained most difficult to predict. Overall, our results highlight that
explanation needs are highly context-dependent and cannot be precisely inferred
from app metadata alone. Developers and requirements engineers should therefore
supplement metadata analysis with direct user feedback to effectively design
explainable and user-centered software systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文研究了代码语言模型压缩技术对模型在对抗攻击下鲁棒性的影响，发现压缩模型在性能上接近原始模型，但在对抗攻击下鲁棒性显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based代码语言模型的高计算成本和环境影响阻碍了其广泛应用，压缩技术虽能缓解这些问题，但其在对抗场景下的鲁棒性影响尚不明确。

Method: 通过评估三种常见压缩策略对三种代码语言模型的影响，使用六种评估指标和四种经典对抗攻击进行综合分析。

Result: 压缩模型在性能上与原始模型相当，但在对抗攻击下鲁棒性显著降低，揭示了模型大小与鲁棒性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在安全关键应用中部署压缩模型时需谨慎，并呼吁进一步研究平衡计算效率和鲁棒性的压缩策略。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models for code have shown remarkable performance
in various software analytics tasks, but their adoption is hindered by high
computational costs, slow inference speeds, and substantial environmental
impact. Model compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and
knowledge distillation have gained traction in addressing these challenges.
However, the impact of these strategies on the robustness of compressed
language models for code in adversarial scenarios remains poorly understood.
Understanding how these compressed models behave under adversarial attacks is
essential for their safe and effective deployment in real-world applications.
To bridge this knowledge gap, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of how
common compression strategies affect the adversarial robustness of compressed
models. We assess the robustness of compressed versions of three widely used
language models for code across three software analytics tasks, using six
evaluation metrics and four commonly used classical adversarial attacks. Our
findings indicate that compressed models generally maintain comparable
performance to their uncompressed counterparts. However, when subjected to
adversarial attacks, compressed models exhibit significantly reduced
robustness. These results reveal a trade-off between model size reduction and
adversarial robustness, underscoring the need for careful consideration when
deploying compressed models in security-critical software applications. Our
study highlights the need for further research into compression strategies that
strike a balance between computational efficiency and adversarial robustness,
which is essential for deploying reliable language models for code in
real-world software applications.

Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) is growing in the productive
completion of Software Engineering tasks. Yet, studies investigating the
productive prompting techniques often employed a limited problem space,
primarily focusing on well-known prompting patterns and mainly targeting
function-level SE practices. We identify significant gaps in real-world
workflows that involve complexities beyond class-level (e.g., multi-class
dependencies) and different features that can impact Human-LLM Interactions
(HLIs) processes in code generation. To address these issues, we designed an
experiment that comprehensively analyzed the HLI features regarding the code
generation productivity. Our study presents two project-level benchmark tasks,
extending beyond function-level evaluations. We conducted a user study with 36
participants from diverse backgrounds, asking them to solve the assigned tasks
by interacting with the GPT assistant using specific prompting patterns. We
also examined the participants' experience and their behavioral features during
interactions by analyzing screen recordings and GPT chat logs. Our statistical
and empirical investigation revealed (1) that three out of 15 HLI features
significantly impacted the productivity in code generation; (2) five primary
guidelines for enhancing productivity for HLI processes; and (3) a taxonomy of
29 runtime and logic errors that can occur during HLI processes, along with
suggested mitigation plans.

TL;DR: EvoC2Rust是一个自动化框架，用于将整个C项目转换为等效的Rust代码，结合了规则和LLM方法的优势，显著提升了语法和语义准确性以及代码安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rust的编译时安全特性使其成为安全关键系统的理想选择，但现有C到Rust转换方法在小规模程序上表现有限，无法满足大规模项目的需求。

Method: EvoC2Rust采用骨架引导的翻译策略，分三个阶段：分解C项目为模块、逐步翻译函数、修复编译错误，结合LLM和静态分析。

Result: 在开源基准和工业项目上，EvoC2Rust在语法和语义准确性上分别提升了17.24%和14.32%，代码安全性提高了96.79%，模块级编译和测试通过率分别达到92.25%和89.53%。

Conclusion: EvoC2Rust通过进化增强方法，成功解决了大规模C到Rust转换的挑战，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Rust's compile-time safety guarantees make it ideal for safety-critical
systems, creating demand for translating legacy C codebases to Rust. While
various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs:
rule-based solutions face challenges in meeting code safety and idiomaticity
requirements, while LLM-based solutions often fail to generate semantically
equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the
entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited
to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated
framework for converting entire C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust
employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation.
The pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the
C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to
transform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs,
which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the
function, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs
compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary
augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and
LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six
industrial projects demonstrates EvoC2Rust's superior performance in
project-level C-to-Rust translation. On average, it achieves 17.24% and 14.32%
improvements in syntax and semantic accuracy over the LLM-based approaches,
along with a 96.79% higher code safety rate than the rule-based tools. At the
module level, EvoC2Rust reaches 92.25% compilation and 89.53% test pass rates
on industrial projects, even for complex codebases and long functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注代码指标，而人类错误是软件缺陷的常见根源，因此探索基于开发者习惯的非软件指标具有重要意义。

Method: 提出一个框架确定预测指标，比较其性能与现有最佳代码和提交历史指标，并分析各指标的重要性。

Result: 在21个关键基础设施开源项目中，新指标表现优于现有最佳指标，且显著提升模型的可解释性和实用性。

Conclusion: 基于人类错误的框架为软件缺陷预测提供了新视角，开发者编码习惯对缺陷预测具有重要价值。

Abstract: Software defect prediction using code metrics has been extensively researched
over the past five decades. However, prediction harnessing non-software metrics
is under-researched. Considering that the root cause of software defects is
often attributed to human error, human factors theory might offer key
forecasting metrics for actionable insights. This paper explores automated
software defect prediction at the method level based on the developers' coding
habits. First, we propose a framework for deciding the metrics to conduct
predictions. Next, we compare the performance of our metrics to that of the
code and commit history metrics shown by research to achieve the highest
performance to date. Finally, we analyze the prediction importance of each
metric. As a result of our analyses of twenty-one critical infrastructure
large-scale open-source software projects, we have presented: (1) a human
error-based framework with metrics useful for defect prediction at method
level; (2) models using our proposed metrics achieve better average prediction
performance than the state-of-the-art code metrics and history measures; (3)
the prediction importance of all metrics distributes differently with each of
the novel metrics having better average importance than code and history
metrics; (4) the novel metrics dramatically enhance the explainability,
practicality, and actionability of software defect prediction models,
significantly advancing the field. We present a systematic approach to
forecasting defect-prone software methods via a human error framework. This
work empowers practitioners to act on predictions, empirically demonstrating
how developer coding habits contribute to defects in software systems.

TL;DR: 该研究对比了六种自动化代码分析工具（三种静态分析工具和三种大语言模型）在检测漏洞方面的表现，发现语言模型在召回率上表现更优，但存在误报和定位不精确的问题，建议采用混合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估静态分析工具和大语言模型在检测代码漏洞方面的性能差异，为开发者提供更有效的工具选择建议。

Method: 使用十个真实世界的C#项目（包含63个漏洞），测量检测准确性（精确率、召回率、F1分数）、分析延迟和开发者验证工作量。

Result: 语言模型的平均F1分数（0.797、0.753、0.750）高于静态工具（0.260、0.386、0.546），但误报率和定位精度较差。

Conclusion: 建议结合语言模型的广泛筛查能力和静态工具的高精度验证，形成混合流程，并发布了开源基准测试工具。

Abstract: Modern software relies on a multitude of automated testing and quality
assurance tools to prevent errors, bugs and potential vulnerabilities. This
study sets out to provide a head-to-head, quantitative and qualitative
evaluation of six automated approaches: three industry-standard rule-based
static code-analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeQL and Snyk Code) and three
state-of-the-art large language models hosted on the GitHub Models platform
(GPT-4.1, Mistral Large and DeepSeek V3). Using a curated suite of ten
real-world C# projects that embed 63 vulnerabilities across common categories
such as SQL injection, hard-coded secrets and outdated dependencies, we measure
classical detection accuracy (precision, recall, F-score), analysis latency,
and the developer effort required to vet true positives. The language-based
scanners achieve higher mean F-1 scores,0.797, 0.753 and 0.750, than their
static counterparts, which score 0.260, 0.386 and 0.546, respectively. LLMs'
advantage originates from superior recall, confirming an ability to reason
across broader code contexts. However, this benefit comes with substantial
trade-offs: DeepSeek V3 exhibits the highest false-positive ratio, all language
models mislocate issues at line-or-column granularity due to tokenisation
artefacts. Overall, language models successfully rival traditional static
analysers in finding real vulnerabilities. Still, their noisier output and
imprecise localisation limit their standalone use in safety-critical audits. We
therefore recommend a hybrid pipeline: employ language models early in
development for broad, context-aware triage, while reserving deterministic
rule-based scanners for high-assurance verification. The open benchmark and
JSON-based result harness released with this paper lay a foundation for
reproducible, practitioner-centric research into next-generation automated code
security.

highlighted the importance of empathy in SE, there is limited understanding of
how empathy manifests in SE practice, what motivates SE practitioners to
demonstrate empathy, and the factors that influence empathy in SE work. Our
study explores these aspects through 22 interviews and a large scale survey
with 116 software practitioners. Our findings provide insights into the
expression of empathy in SE, the drivers behind empathetic practices, SE
activities where empathy is perceived as useful or not, and the other factors
that influence empathy. In addition, we offer practical implications for SE
practitioners and researchers, offering a deeper understanding of how to
effectively integrate empathy into SE processes.

Conclusion: 该方法在高维矩阵值时间序列预测中表现优异，特别是在弱因子结构下，通过监督筛选进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel diffusion-index model for forecasting when
predictors are high-dimensional matrix-valued time series. We apply an
$\alpha$-PCA method to extract low-dimensional matrix factors and build a
bilinear regression linking future outcomes to these factors, estimated via
iterative least squares. To handle weak factor structures, we introduce a
supervised screening step to select informative rows and columns. Theoretical
properties, including consistency and asymptotic normality, are established.
Simulations and real data show that our method significantly improves forecast
accuracy, with the screening procedure providing additional gains over standard
benchmarks in out-of-sample mean squared forecast error.

Result: 年轻高管更倾向AI投资，生产力提升通过成本削减、收入增加和创新加速实现。

Conclusion: 研究为企业治理和AI投资激励政策提供了实证依据。

Abstract: This paper investigates how executive demographics particularly age and
gender influence artificial intelligence (AI) investment decisions and
subsequent firm productivity using comprehensive data from over 500 Japanese
enterprises spanning from 2018 to 2023. Our central research question addresses
the role of executive characteristics in technology adoption, finding that CEO
age and technical background significantly predict AI investment propensity.
Employing these demographic characteristics as instrumental variables to
address endogeneity concerns, we identify a statistically significant 2.4%
increase in total factor productivity attributable to AI investment adoption.
Our novel mechanism decomposition framework reveals that productivity gains
operate through three distinct channels: cost reduction (40% of total effect),
revenue enhancement (35%), and innovation acceleration (25%). The results
demonstrate that younger executives (below 50 years) are 23% more likely to
adopt AI technologies, while firm size significantly moderates this
relationship. Aggregate projections suggest potential GDP impacts of 1.15
trillion JPY from widespread AI adoption across the Japanese economy. These
findings provide crucial empirical guidance for understanding the human factors
driving digital transformation and inform both corporate governance and public
policy regarding AI investment incentives.

Conclusion: 建议扩大H-2A签证计划并合法化无证工人以稳定农业部门，研究为移民执法的经济影响提供了数据支持。

Abstract: In 2025, intensified Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in
Oxnard, California, disrupted the state's \$49 billion agricultural industry, a
critical supplier of 75% of U.S. fruits and nuts and one-third of its
vegetables. This paper quantifies the economic consequences of these raids on
labor markets, crop production, and food prices using econometric modeling. We
estimate a 20-40% reduction in the agricultural workforce, leading to \$3-7
billion in crop losses and a 5-12% increase in produce prices. The analysis
draws on USDA Economic Research Service data and recent ICE detention figures,
which show arrests in Southern California rising from 699 in May to nearly
2,000 in June 2025. The raids disproportionately affect labor-intensive crops
like strawberries, exacerbating supply chain disruptions. Policy
recommendations include expanding the H-2A visa program and legalizing
undocumented workers to stabilize the sector. This study contributes to
agricultural economics by providing a data-driven assessment of immigration
enforcement's economic toll.

Motivation: 探讨出口对就业和环境的具体影响，尤其是长期调整过程。

Method: 结合海关、行政和普查微观数据，估计出口对就业的弹性，并基于环境影响的分类分析。

Result: 出口增长短期内促进正式就业（弹性0.25-0.4），长期对可持续就业影响更持久；环境风险活动就业短期反应强但长期逆转。

Conclusion: 出口对就业和环境的影响具有复杂性和长期性，需政策关注可持续就业的持久效应。

Abstract: What is the environmental impact of exports? Focusing on 2000-20, this paper
combines customs, administrative, and census microdata to estimate employment
elasticities with respect to exports. The findings show that municipalities
that faced increased exports experienced faster growth in formal employment.
The elasticities were 0.25 on impact, peaked at 0.4, and remained positive and
significant even 10 years after the shock, pointing to a long and protracted
labor market adjustment. In the long run, informal employment responds
negatively to export shocks. Using a granular taxonomy for economic activities
based on their environmental impact, the paper documents that environmentally
risky activities have a larger share of employment than environmentally
sustainable ones, and that the relationship between these activities and
exports is nuanced. Over the short run, environmentally risky employment
responds more strongly to exports relative to environmentally sustainable
employment. However, over the long run, this pattern reverses, as the impact of
exports on environmentally sustainable employment is more persistent.

perceptions of inclusion, respect, and professional treatment. Reports of
discrimination, exclusion, and harassment were significantly higher among
women, ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities.
Geographic differences also emerged, with the Nordic countries reporting the
most positive climate and the UK and Italy showing higher levels of
dissatisfaction and discrimination. Compared to the American Economic
Association 2018 survey, European respondents reported lower satisfaction
overall.

### [277] [Testing Spillovers in Resource Conservation: Evidence from a Natural Field Experiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04371)
*Lorenz Goette,Zhi Hao Lim*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究行为干预在资源节约领域的溢出效应，发现节水干预显著减少淋浴用水，但对空调能耗无直接影响或溢出效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨行为干预在资源节约中的跨领域溢出效应，以评估其实际效果。

Method: 通过大规模自然田野实验，对2000名居民实施实时反馈和社交比较干预，分别针对淋浴用水和空调能耗。

Result: 节水干预显著减少淋浴用水，但对空调能耗无直接或溢出效应。

Conclusion: 行为干预在资源节约中的溢出效应有限，需针对性设计以实现跨领域影响。

Abstract: This paper studies the potential for behavioral interventions aimed at
promoting resource conservation within one domain to induce spillovers in
another. Through a large-scale natural field experiment involving around 2,000
residents, we assess the direct and spillover effects of real-time feedback and
social comparisons on water and energy consumption. Three interventions were
implemented: two targeting shower use and one targeting air-conditioning use.
We document a significant reduction in shower use attributable to both
water-saving interventions, but no direct effects on air-conditioning use from
the energy-saving intervention. For spillovers, we precisely estimated null
effects on air-conditioning use arising from the water-saving interventions,
and vice versa.

Abstract: Stablecoins have become a foundational component of the digital asset
ecosystem, with their market capitalization exceeding 230 billion USD as of May
2025. As fiat-referenced and programmable assets, stablecoins provide
low-latency, globally interoperable infrastructure for payments, decentralized
finance, DeFi, and tokenized commerce. Their accelerated adoption has prompted
extensive regulatory engagement, exemplified by the European Union's Markets in
Crypto-assets Regulation, MiCA, the US Guiding and Establishing National
Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, GENIUS Act, and Hong Kong's Stablecoins
Bill. Despite this momentum, academic research remains fragmented across
economics, law, and computer science, lacking a unified framework for design,
evaluation, and application. This study addresses that gap through a
multi-method research design. First, it synthesizes cross-disciplinary
literature to construct a taxonomy of stablecoin systems based on custodial
structure, stabilization mechanism, and governance. Second, it develops a
performance evaluation framework tailored to diverse stakeholder needs,
supported by an open-source benchmarking pipeline to ensure transparency and
reproducibility. Third, a case study on Real World Asset tokenization
illustrates how stablecoins operate as programmable monetary infrastructure in
cross-border digital systems. By integrating conceptual theory with empirical
tools, the paper contributes: a unified taxonomy for stablecoin design; a
stakeholder-oriented performance evaluation framework; an empirical case
linking stablecoins to sectoral transformation; and reproducible methods and
datasets to inform future research. These contributions support the development
of trusted, inclusive, and transparent digital monetary infrastructure.

### [279] [Uncharted Waters: Selling a New Product Robustly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04134)
*Kun Zhang*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 卖家在推出新产品时需权衡定价与信息提供，以最大化利润，同时考虑买家的搜索成本。信息提供可能抑制搜索但需降低价格，结果解释了新产品信息差异，并指出低搜索成本可能导致价格上升和信息模糊，损害消费者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究卖家在信息不对称和买家搜索成本下的定价与信息提供策略，以最大化利润并保持稳健性。

Method: 卖家基于已知的买家外部选项分布（仅知均值和边界），评估策略以平衡搜索抑制与利润提取。

Result: 信息提供可抑制搜索但需降低价格；低搜索成本可能导致价格上升和信息模糊，损害消费者。

Conclusion: 研究解释了新产品信息差异，并指出低搜索成本可能对消费者不利。

Abstract: When introducing a novel product, a seller sets a price and decides how much
information to provide to a buyer, who may incur a search cost to discover an
outside option. The buyer knows the outside option distribution; the seller
knows only its mean and bounds. Seeking "robustness," the seller evaluates
strategies based on guaranteed profits, balancing search deterrence against
surplus extraction. Providing information can deter search and boost demand but
requires offering the buyer a higher payoff via a lower price. Results help
explain the variations in information provision among new products and suggest
that lower search costs can raise prices and lead to noisier information,
potentially harming consumers.

### [280] [Screening with damages and ordeals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04456)
*Filip Tokarski*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 论文研究了两种浪费性筛选工具（ordeals和damages）在福利最大化设计中的使用，发现damages在多维类型下可能最优，但特定分布条件下ordeals更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在分配两种商品时，如何通过ordeals和damages这两种筛选工具实现福利最大化，并分析其在不同类型分布下的适用性。

Method: 通过理论模型分析两种筛选工具（ordeals和damages）在分配两种商品时的效果，比较其在不同类型分布下的表现。

Result: 当代理人对两种商品的估值均异质时，damages可能最优；但在特定分布条件下，ordeals能实现更优的分配。

Conclusion: 在多维类型下，damages可能优于ordeals，但特定条件下仅使用ordeals即可实现最优分配。

Abstract: A welfare-maximizing designer allocates two kinds of goods using two wasteful
screening instruments: ordeals, which enter agents' utilities additively, and
damages, which harm agents in proportion to their values for the goods. If
agents have common valuations for one of the goods, damages always lead to
Pareto-dominated mechanisms: any allocation using damages can also be
implemented with ordeals alone, while also leaving greater rents to
inframarginal types. However, using damages can be optimal when agents'
valuations for both goods are heterogeneous: with multidimensional types, the
two devices differ in how they sort agents into available options, with the
optimal sorting sometimes requiring the use of damages. I nevertheless identify
distributional conditions under which using damages is not optimal. In those
cases, the optimal mechanism produces an efficient allocation by posting
"market-clearing" ordeals for each type of good.

### [281] [Think Before You Segment: An Object-aware Reasoning Agent for Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04418)
*Jinxing Zhou,Yanghao Zhou,Mingfei Han,Tong Wang,Xiaojun Chang,Hisham Cholakkal,Rao Muhammad Anwer*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文提出TGS-Agent方法，通过Think-Ground-Segment流程解决Ref-AVS任务，模仿人类推理过程，无需像素级监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖潜在嵌入学习和像素级监督，缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出Ref-Thinker多模态语言模型，通过指令调优数据集生成显式对象描述，结合Grounding-DINO和SAM2完成定位与分割。

Result: 在Ref-AVSBench和R²-AVSBench上取得最优结果。

Conclusion: TGS-Agent通过显式推理流程提升了任务性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects
in audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically
rely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable
SAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level
supervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit
reference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a
Think-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first
identifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by
coarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first
propose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over
textual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset
with explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The
object description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for
Grounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without
relying on pixel-level supervision. Additionally, we introduce
R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench, a new benchmark with linguistically diverse and
reasoning-intensive references for better evaluating model generalization. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard Ref-AVSBench and
proposed R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench. Code will be available at
https://github.com/jasongief/TGS-Agent.

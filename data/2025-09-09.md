Motivation: 受早期视频艺术家操控模拟视频信号的启发，将AI模型内部工作机制重新引入为创作中组，促进艺术家对AI技术的解释性和创造性探索

Method: 基于开源Wan模型构建工具，提取和可视化跨注意力地图，通过探索性探针和艺术案例研究分析注意力机制的时空行为

Abstract: This paper presents an artistic and technical investigation into the
attention mechanisms of video diffusion transformers. Inspired by early video
artists who manipulated analog video signals to create new visual aesthetics,
this study proposes a method for extracting and visualizing cross-attention
maps in generative video models. Built on the open-source Wan model, our tool
provides an interpretable window into the temporal and spatial behavior of
attention in text-to-video generation. Through exploratory probes and an
artistic case study, we examine the potential of attention maps as both
analytical tools and raw artistic material. This work contributes to the
growing field of Explainable AI for the Arts (XAIxArts), inviting artists to
reclaim the inner workings of AI as a creative medium.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Perception Graph模型来检测和分析AR系统中的认知攻击，通过量化感知扭曲程度来保护用户决策能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR系统在战术环境中部署增加，但其依赖无缝人机交互的特性使其容易受到认知攻击，这些攻击会操纵用户感知并严重损害决策能力

Method: 引入Perception Graph模型，首先模拟人类从MR环境中解释关键信息的过程，然后用语义有意义的结构表示结果，计算反映感知扭曲程度的量化分数

Result: 模型能够计算量化分数来反映感知扭曲水平

Conclusion: Perception Graph提供了一种稳健且可测量的方法来检测和分析认知攻击的影响

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) systems are increasingly deployed in tactical
environments, but their reliance on seamless human-computer interaction makes
them vulnerable to cognitive attacks that manipulate a user's perception and
severely compromise user decision-making. To address this challenge, we
introduce the Perception Graph, a novel model designed to reason about human
perception within these systems. Our model operates by first mimicking the
human process of interpreting key information from an MR environment and then
representing the outcomes using a semantically meaningful structure. We
demonstrate how the model can compute a quantitative score that reflects the
level of perception distortion, providing a robust and measurable method for
detecting and analyzing the effects of such cognitive attacks.

*Liming Xu,Yunbo Long,Alexandra Brintrup*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SynDelay是一个用于交付延迟预测的合成数据集，通过先进生成模型基于真实数据创建，既保持真实交付模式又确保隐私，为供应链AI研究提供公开可用的基准测试平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前供应链管理中AI预测任务（如交付延迟预测）受限于高质量公开数据集的稀缺性，现有数据集多为专有、规模小或不一致，阻碍了研究的可重复性和基准测试。

Method: 使用基于真实数据训练的先进生成模型创建合成数据集SynDelay，保留真实的交付模式同时确保数据隐私，并提供基线结果和评估指标作为初始基准。

Result: SynDelay数据集虽然不完全无噪声或不一致，但为预测建模提供了一个具有挑战性和实用性的测试平台，并通过Supply Chain Data Hub公开可用。

Conclusion: 该研究通过提供公开可用的合成数据集促进了供应链AI研究的发展，鼓励社区贡献数据集、模型和评估实践以推动该领域进步。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming supply chain management, yet
progress in predictive tasks -- such as delivery delay prediction -- remains
constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, openly available datasets.
Existing datasets are often proprietary, small, or inconsistently maintained,
hindering reproducibility and benchmarking. We present SynDelay, a synthetic
dataset designed for delivery delay prediction. Generated using an advanced
generative model trained on real-world data, SynDelay preserves realistic
delivery patterns while ensuring privacy. Although not entirely free of noise
or inconsistencies, it provides a challenging and practical testbed for
advancing predictive modelling. To support adoption, we provide baseline
results and evaluation metrics as initial benchmarks, serving as reference
points rather than state-of-the-art claims. SynDelay is publicly available
through the Supply Chain Data Hub, an open initiative promoting dataset sharing
and benchmarking in supply chain AI. We encourage the community to contribute
datasets, models, and evaluation practices to advance research in this area.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MVRS数据集：包含13名参与者的多模态情感数据（眼动、身体运动、生理信号），通过VR情感刺激收集，验证了多模态融合在情感识别中的有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前情感识别领域缺乏包含身体运动和生理信号的多模态数据集，限制了该领域的发展

Method: 使用VR情感刺激收集13名参与者同步的眼动、身体运动、EMG和GSR信号数据，采用早期和晚期融合技术进行特征融合，并用分类器评估

Result: 数据集质量良好，情感类别可分性得到验证，MVRS成为多模态情感计算的重要贡献

Conclusion: MVRS数据集填补了多模态情感数据空白，为情感识别研究提供了有价值的资源，证明了多模态融合在情感识别中的潜力

Abstract: Automatic emotion recognition has become increasingly important with the rise
of AI, especially in fields like healthcare, education, and automotive systems.
However, there is a lack of multimodal datasets, particularly involving body
motion and physiological signals, which limits progress in the field. To
address this, the MVRS dataset is introduced, featuring synchronized recordings
from 13 participants aged 12 to 60 exposed to VR based emotional stimuli
(relaxation, fear, stress, sadness, joy). Data were collected using eye
tracking (via webcam in a VR headset), body motion (Kinect v2), and EMG and GSR
signals (Arduino UNO), all timestamp aligned. Participants followed a unified
protocol with consent and questionnaires. Features from each modality were
extracted, fused using early and late fusion techniques, and evaluated with
classifiers to confirm the datasets quality and emotion separability, making
MVRS a valuable contribution to multimodal affective computing.

### [5] [Benchmarking Large Language Models for Personalized Guidance in AI-Enhanced Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05346)
*Bo Yuan,Jiazi Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验比较GPT-4o、DeepSeek-V3和GLM-4.5在个性化教育辅导任务中的表现，发现GPT-4o在准确性、清晰度和可操作性方面更受偏好，为LLM在教育领域的应用提供了实证基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型被趋势性地视为个性化学习的智能助手，但在真实学习场景中的系统性头对头评估仍然有限。本研究旨在填补这一空白，通过实证比较不同LLM在教学辅导任务中的表现。

Method: 研究使用包含学生答案和正确标签的数据集，要求三个先进LLM（GPT-4o、DeepSeek-V3、GLM-4.5）进行知识组件分析、学生掌握情况推断和针对性指导生成。采用Gemini作为虚拟判官进行多维度的成对比较，并通过Bradley-Terry模型分析结果。

Result: 分析结果显示GPT-4o通常更受偏好，能够产生更信息丰富、结构更好的反馈。DeepSeek-V3和GLM-4.5展现出间息性优势但一致性较低。

Conclusion: 研究证明了LLM作为高级教学助手为个体化支持的可行性，为未来LLM驱动的个性化学习研究提供了方法论指导。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent
assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations
within authentic learning scenarios remain limited. This study conducts an
empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task that
simulates a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset comprising a student's
answers to ten questions of mixed formats with correctness labels, each LLM is
required to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components,
(ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance
for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, we employ Gemini
as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons along various dimensions:
accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the
Bradley-Terry model indicate that GPT-4o is generally preferred, producing
feedback that is more informative and better structured than its counterparts,
while DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 demonstrate intermittent strengths but lower
consistency. These findings highlight the feasibility of deploying LLMs as
advanced teaching assistants for individualized support and provide
methodological guidance for future empirical research on LLM-driven
personalized learning.

### [6] [SasAgent: Multi-Agent AI System for Small-Angle Scattering Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05363)
*Lijie Ding,Changwoo Do*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SasAgent是一个基于大语言模型的多代理AI系统，用于自动化小角散射数据分析，通过SasView工具和文本交互实现用户友好的科学工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决小角散射数据分析的复杂性，提高自动化水平，利用大语言模型的能力来简化科学工作流程。

Result: 系统能够解释复杂提示、准确计算SLD、生成精确散射数据，并以高精度拟合实验数据集，展示了在SAS研究中的高效自动化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了LLM驱动的AI系统在简化科学工作流程和增强SAS研究自动化方面的巨大潜力。

Abstract: We introduce SasAgent, a multi-agent AI system powered by large language
models (LLMs) that automates small-angle scattering (SAS) data analysis by
leveraging tools from the SasView software and enables user interaction via
text input. SasAgent features a coordinator agent that interprets user prompts
and delegates tasks to three specialized agents for scattering length density
(SLD) calculation, synthetic data generation, and experimental data fitting.
These agents utilize LLM-friendly tools to execute tasks efficiently. These
tools, including the model data tool, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
documentation tool, bump fitting tool, and SLD calculator tool, are derived
from the SasView Python library. A user-friendly Gradio-based interface
enhances user accessibility. Through diverse examples, we demonstrate
SasAgent's ability to interpret complex prompts, calculate SLDs, generate
accurate scattering data, and fit experimental datasets with high precision.
This work showcases the potential of LLM-driven AI systems to streamline
scientific workflows and enhance automation in SAS research.

### [7] [Characterizing Fitness Landscape Structures in Prompt Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05375)
*Arend Hintze*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过自相关分析揭示了提示工程优化景观的拓扑结构，发现系统化提示生成产生平滑衰减的自相关，而多样化生成则呈现非单调模式，表明存在崎岖、分层结构的景观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法将提示优化视为黑盒问题，应用复杂搜索算法而不描述其导航的景观拓扑，因此需要系统分析提示工程中的适应度景观结构。

Method: 使用语义嵌入空间中的自相关分析，在错误检测任务上进行实验，采用两种不同的提示生成策略：系统枚举（1,024个提示）和新颖性驱动的多样化（1,000个提示）。

Result: 发现不同的提示生成策略产生根本不同的景观拓扑结构，系统化生成产生平滑衰减的自相关，多样化生成呈现非单调模式，峰值相关性出现在中间语义距离处。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解提示工程景观中优化的复杂性提供了实证基础，揭示了不同错误类型具有不同程度的崎岖性。

Abstract: While prompt engineering has emerged as a crucial technique for optimizing
large language model performance, the underlying optimization landscape remains
poorly understood. Current approaches treat prompt optimization as a black-box
problem, applying sophisticated search algorithms without characterizing the
landscape topology they navigate. We present a systematic analysis of fitness
landscape structures in prompt engineering using autocorrelation analysis
across semantic embedding spaces. Through experiments on error detection tasks
with two distinct prompt generation strategies -- systematic enumeration (1,024
prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts) -- we reveal
fundamentally different landscape topologies. Systematic prompt generation
yields smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits
non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate semantic
distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes.
Task-specific analysis across 10 error detection categories reveals varying
degrees of ruggedness across different error types. Our findings provide an
empirical foundation for understanding the complexity of optimization in prompt
engineering landscapes.

### [8] [Code Like Humans: A Multi-Agent Solution for Medical Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05378)
*Andreas Motzfeldt,Joakim Edin,Casper L. Christensen,Christian Hardmeier,Lars Maaløe,Anna Rogers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Code Like Humans是一个基于大语言模型的医疗编码代理框架，首次支持完整ICD-10编码系统（7万+标签），在罕见诊断代码上达到最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗编码需要将非结构化临床记录映射到诊断和程序的字母数字代码，现有方法在处理完整ICD-10系统和罕见代码方面存在局限。

Method: 开发了一个代理框架，实现了官方的人类专家编码指南，使用大语言模型进行医疗编码。

Result: 在罕见诊断代码上取得了最佳性能，但微调判别分类器在高频代码上仍保持优势（这些分类器仅限于高频代码）。

Conclusion: 贡献了系统性能分析并识别了系统的'盲点'（系统性编码不足的代码），为未来工作指明方向。

Abstract: In medical coding, experts map unstructured clinical notes to alphanumeric
codes for diagnoses and procedures. We introduce Code Like Humans: a new
agentic framework for medical coding with large language models. It implements
official coding guidelines for human experts, and it is the first solution that
can support the full ICD-10 coding system (+70K labels). It achieves the best
performance to date on rare diagnosis codes (fine-tuned discriminative
classifiers retain an advantage for high-frequency codes, to which they are
limited). Towards future work, we also contribute an analysis of system
performance and identify its `blind spots' (codes that are systematically
undercoded).

### [9] [Murphys Laws of AI Alignment: Why the Gap Always Wins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05381)
*Madhava Gaikwad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Alignment Gap概念，统一解释RLHF等对齐方法的失败模式，通过KL-tilting形式化说明代理奖励与人类意图的偏差，提出Alignment Trilemma框架和MAPS设计杠杆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF、DPO等人类偏好对齐方法存在奖励黑客、奉承、标注者漂移和错误泛化等重复性失败模式，需要统一的理论框架来理解这些结构性限制。

Method: 使用KL-tilting形式化方法分析优化压力导致代理奖励与真实人类意图偏差的原因，组织失败模式分类，提出Alignment Trilemma理论框架，并通过小规模实证研究验证。

Result: 建立了Alignment Gap统一视角，将常见失败模式归类为AI对齐的Murphy定律，提出了优化强度、价值捕获和泛化能力之间的三难权衡框架。

Conclusion: 本文不是提出不可能定理，而是提供了重构对齐辩论的结构性限制和权衡视角，为未来设计提供更清晰的指导，并提出了MAPS（错误规范、标注、压力、偏移）实践设计框架。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly aligned to human preferences through
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related methods such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, and RLAIF. While
effective, these methods exhibit recurring failure patterns i.e., reward
hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, and misgeneralization. We introduce the
concept of the Alignment Gap, a unifying lens for understanding recurring
failures in feedback-based alignment. Using a KL-tilting formalism, we
illustrate why optimization pressure tends to amplify divergence between proxy
rewards and true human intent. We organize these failures into a catalogue of
Murphys Laws of AI Alignment, and propose the Alignment Trilemma as a way to
frame trade-offs among optimization strength, value capture, and
generalization. Small-scale empirical studies serve as illustrative support.
Finally, we propose the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure,
Shift) as practical design levers. Our contribution is not a definitive
impossibility theorem but a perspective that reframes alignment debates around
structural limits and trade-offs, offering clearer guidance for future design.

### [10] [From Image Generation to Infrastructure Design: a Multi-agent Pipeline for Street Design Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05469)
*Chenguang Wang,Xiang Yan,Yilong Dai,Ziyi Wang,Susu Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 一个多段系统通过AI生成技术在实际街道景观上编辑和重新设计自行车设施，提高了交通规划中的公众参与效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统街道设计渲染方法劳动密集且效率低，影响集体决策；现有AI生成方法需要大量领域数据且难以实现精确空间变化

Method: 多段系统集成了车道定位、提示优化、设计生成和自动评估等模块，直接在实际街道景观上编辑自行车设施

Result: 系统能够适应不同城市场景、路径几何和环境条件，产生视觉一致且符合指令要求的设计结果

Conclusion: 该研究为多段系统在交通基础设施规划和设计中的应用奠定了基础

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation
infrastructure planning and facility design.

### [11] [TreeGPT: A Novel Hybrid Architecture for Abstract Syntax Tree Processing with Global Parent-Child Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05550)
*Zixi Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TreeGPT是一种结合Transformer注意力机制和全局父子聚合的新型神经网络架构，专门用于处理抽象语法树(AST)的程序合成任务，在ARC Prize 2025数据集上达到96%准确率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么依赖序列处理要么使用图神经网络，无法有效捕捉AST的层次结构和全局依赖关系，需要一种能够同时处理局部依赖和层次树结构的新架构。

Method: 采用混合设计：使用自注意力机制捕捉局部依赖，通过专门的Tree Feed-Forward Network和全局父子聚合机制建模层次树结构。核心创新是全局父子聚合公式，允许节点通过迭代消息传递从整个树结构聚合信息。

Result: 在ARC Prize 2025数据集上达到96%准确率，显著优于Transformer基线(1.3%)、Grok-4(15.9%)和SOAR(52%)等方法，仅使用150万参数。消融研究表明边缘投影是最关键组件。

Conclusion: TreeGPT通过结合注意力机制和树结构聚合，在程序合成任务中表现出色，证明了混合架构在处理层次树结构数据方面的有效性，为神经程序合成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce TreeGPT, a novel neural architecture that combines
transformer-based attention mechanisms with global parent-child aggregation for
processing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in neural program synthesis tasks.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on sequential processing or
graph neural networks, TreeGPT employs a hybrid design that leverages both
self-attention for capturing local dependencies and a specialized Tree
Feed-Forward Network (TreeFFN) for modeling hierarchical tree structures
through iterative message passing.
  The core innovation lies in our Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism,
formalized as: $$h_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma \Big( h_i^{(0)} + W_{pc} \sum_{(p,c) \in
E_i} f(h_p^{(t)}, h_c^{(t)}) + b \Big)$$ where $h_i^{(t)}$ represents the
hidden state of node $i$ at iteration $t$, $E_i$ denotes all parent-child edges
involving node $i$, and $f(h_p, h_c)$ is an edge aggregation function. This
formulation enables each node to progressively aggregate information from the
entire tree structure through $T$ iterations.
  Our architecture integrates optional enhancements including gated aggregation
with learnable edge weights, residual connections for gradient stability, and
bidirectional propagation for capturing both bottom-up and top-down
dependencies. We evaluate TreeGPT on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, a challenging
visual reasoning benchmark requiring abstract pattern recognition and rule
inference. Experimental results demonstrate that TreeGPT achieves 96\%
accuracy, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3\%),
large-scale models like Grok-4 (15.9\%), and specialized program synthesis
methods like SOAR (52\%) while using only 1.5M parameters. Our comprehensive
ablation study reveals that edge projection is the most critical component,
with the combination of edge projection and gating achieving optimal
performance.

### [12] [OccVLA: Vision-Language-Action Model with Implicit 3D Occupancy Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05578)
*Ruixun Liu,Lingyu Kong,Derun Li,Hang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OccVLA是一个创新的多模态框架，通过将3D占用表示集成到统一推理过程中，解决了MLLM在3D空间理解方面的局限性，无需昂贵的手动标注即可实现自动驾驶的精细空间结构学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视觉-语言推理方面表现出色，但缺乏强大的3D空间理解能力，这对于自动驾驶至关重要。主要挑战包括：构建有效3D表示的难度和缺乏大规模3D视觉-语言预训练导致的细粒度空间细节丢失。

Method: 提出OccVLA框架，将密集3D占用既作为预测输出又作为监督信号，使模型能够直接从2D视觉输入学习细粒度空间结构。占用预测被视为隐式推理过程，在推理时可跳过而不影响性能，不增加额外计算开销。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中实现了轨迹规划的最先进结果，在3D视觉问答任务上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: OccVLA为自动驾驶提供了一个可扩展、可解释且完全基于视觉的解决方案，成功解决了3D空间理解的挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language
reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is
critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges:
(1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations
without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial
details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language
pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework
that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal
reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs,
OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory
signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly
from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit
reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance
degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and
demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks,
offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for
autonomous driving.

*Jian Yang,Jiahui Wu,Li Fang,Hongchao Fan,Bianying Zhang,Huijie Zhao,Guangyi Yang,Rui Xin,Xiong You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSRFormer是一个多尺度道路网络表示学习框架，通过空间流卷积和图变换器处理道路网络的异质性和层次性，在真实数据集上优于基线方法，性能提升达16%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市道路网络具有异质性和层次性特点，传统图神经网络因同质性假设和单一尺度关注而难以准确学习表示，需要解决多尺度空间交互的流量异质性和长距离依赖问题。

Method: 使用空间流卷积从轨迹数据提取小尺度特征，识别尺度依赖的空间交互区域来捕捉空间结构和流量异质性，通过图变换器捕获多尺度复杂空间依赖，采用残差连接融合特征并进行对比学习。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的验证表明，MSRFormer在道路网络分析任务中优于基线方法，交通相关任务从轨迹数据整合中获益更多，在复杂道路网络结构中性能提升高达16%。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发任务无关的道路网络表示模型提供了实用框架，揭示了尺度效应与空间交互流量异质性之间相互作用的独特关联模式。

Abstract: Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep
learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road
networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate
representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from
neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus
on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents
MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that
integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow
heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution
to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies
scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of
road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,
MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple
scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,
which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road
network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that
MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The
performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more
from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in
complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the
most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework
for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights
distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow
heterogeneity of spatial interactions.

TL;DR: CogEdit是一个评估多模态大语言模型元认知知识编辑能力的新基准，包含反事实驱动编辑、边界约束编辑和噪声鲁棒编辑三个层次。提出的MIND框架通过元知识记忆、博弈论交互和标签精炼显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注认知层面的修改，缺乏对更深层次元认知过程的关注，需要评估MLLMs在元认知知识编辑方面的能力。

Method: 提出MIND框架：构建元知识记忆用于自我意识，使用博弈论交互监控知识激活，结合标签精炼实现噪声鲁棒更新。

Result: MIND在传统和元认知知识编辑基准上都显著优于现有认知编辑方法，表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: CogEdit基准和MIND框架有效填补了元认知知识编辑评估的空白，为MLLMs的深层知识更新提供了新方向。

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and
demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural
language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding,
text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world
data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein
networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and
linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively
learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from
these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area.
Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures,
hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity
as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across
domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we
provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in
LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance
semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the
paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs
(HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log
maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4)
hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications
and outline future research directions. A repository of key papers, models,
datasets, and code implementations is available at

Motivation: 解决能源管理中不确定性决策问题，特别是电池储能系统运营中因预测误差导致的次优决策，传统预测后优化方法存在局限性，而新兴的决策聚焦学习方法缺乏实际验证。

Method: 提出AFE-DFL框架，利用自动特征工程提取丰富特征表示，结合决策聚焦学习方法同时进行电价需求预测和BESS运营优化，在真实英国房产数据集上进行验证。

Result: DFL方法比PTO平均产生更低运营成本，加入AFE后DFL性能提升22.9-56.5%，证明了DFL在实际应用中的可行性。

Conclusion: 领域特定的自动特征工程增强了决策聚焦学习，减少了对领域专业知识的依赖，为面临类似挑战的能源管理系统带来经济效益和更广泛影响。

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty in energy management is complicated by
unknown parameters hindering optimal strategies, particularly in Battery Energy
Storage System (BESS) operations. Predict-Then-Optimise (PTO) approaches treat
forecasting and optimisation as separate processes, allowing prediction errors
to cascade into suboptimal decisions as models minimise forecasting errors
rather than optimising downstream tasks. The emerging Decision-Focused Learning
(DFL) methods overcome this limitation by integrating prediction and
optimisation; however, they are relatively new and have been tested primarily
on synthetic datasets or small-scale problems, with limited evidence of their
practical viability. Real-world BESS applications present additional
challenges, including greater variability and data scarcity due to collection
constraints and operational limitations. Because of these challenges, this work
leverages Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) to extract richer representations
and improve the nascent approach of DFL. We propose an AFE-DFL framework
suitable for small datasets that forecasts electricity prices and demand while
optimising BESS operations to minimise costs. We validate its effectiveness on
a novel real-world UK property dataset. The evaluation compares DFL methods
against PTO, with and without AFE. The results show that, on average, DFL
yields lower operating costs than PTO and adding AFE further improves the
performance of DFL methods by 22.9-56.5% compared to the same models without
AFE. These findings provide empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in
real-world settings, indicating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and
reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimisation, yielding economic
benefits with broader implications for energy management systems facing similar
challenges.

TL;DR: NoteAid-Chatbot是一个基于多智能体LLM和强化学习的对话AI系统，通过'学习即对话'框架帮助患者理解医疗信息，使用轻量级LLaMA 3.2 3B模型，无需人工标注数据就能实现清晰、相关和结构化对话等关键行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者需要具备必要的知识来积极参与自身护理，但传统方法往往缺乏有效的患者教育工具。本研究旨在开发一个能够促进患者理解的对话AI系统。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在基于医疗对话策略合成的对话数据上进行监督微调，然后通过强化学习（使用PPO算法）在模拟医院出院场景中进行训练，奖励基于患者理解评估。

Result: 评估显示NoteAid-Chatbot表现出关键的新兴行为（清晰性、相关性和结构化对话），在图灵测试中超越了非专家人类表现，证明即使简单的PPO奖励建模也能成功训练轻量级领域特定聊天机器人。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了将低成本、基于PPO的强化学习应用于现实开放对话领域的可行性和前景，拓宽了基于RL的对齐方法的适用性，虽然当前聚焦医疗领域但具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Patients must possess the knowledge necessary to actively participate in
their care. We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes
patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built
on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL)
setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight
LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on
conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation
strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding
assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which
includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates
that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient
education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it
received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that
even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can
successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn
interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced
communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot
surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the
framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying
low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains,
broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.

Motivation: 现有AI代理框架主要针对数学、编程等领域，在地理空间任务中表现不佳，需要处理空间推理、多跳规划和实时地图交互等挑战

Method: 采用分层多智能体架构：高层规划器分解复杂查询为子目标，路由到专门模块；地图工具代理并行协调相关API获取地理空间数据；简单模块无需额外代理开销

Result: 在四个地理空间基准测试(MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, MapQA)上显著优于现有工具增强和代理基线方法

Conclusion: MapAgent通过分层设计和专用工具集有效解决了地理空间推理的独特挑战，降低了认知负载，提高了工具选择精度和API协调能力

Abstract: Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most
existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web
automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,
multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,
we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with
customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial
reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools
uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different
geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level
planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to
specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then
design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs
adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the
query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)
operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces
cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise
coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse
geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and
MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented
and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork at

TL;DR: 提出了DRER强化学习奖励框架，通过推理质量奖励和动态长度优势来优化大语言模型的推理能力，在Logictree数据集上7B模型达到GPT-o3-mini水平，推理置信度提升30%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的奖励函数只评估答案格式和正确性，无法判断推理链是否真正改善答案，且任务特定训练对逻辑深度的控制有限

Method: DRER框架包含：(i)推理质量奖励-为提升正确答案概率的推理链分配细粒度奖励；(ii)动态长度优势-对偏离验证阈值的响应长度进行优势衰减

Result: 7B模型在400训练步后达到GPT-o3-mini性能水平，CoT增强答案的平均置信度提升30%，在多种逻辑推理数据集和AIME24数学基准上展现泛化能力

Conclusion: DRER有效塑造CoT行为，为增强大语言模型的形式推理能力提供了实用路径

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for
strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the
rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming
benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to
whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer.
Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical
depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We
propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward
framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning
Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that
demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising
the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage
decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a
validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous
assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive
reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a
comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B
model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing
steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The
model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning
datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how
RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing
formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are
available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.

Conclusion: REER范式为开放式创意生成中的深度推理提供了新的有效途径，通过逆向工程方法成功解决了传统方法的局限性，展示了在创意任务上的强大潜力

Abstract: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

Motivation: 大型推理模型(LRMs)在处理简单问题时容易过度思考，产生冗长复杂的推理轨迹，影响可解释性和效率。研究发现LRMs难以平衡正确性和简洁性等多个生成目标。

Method: 提出EDIT方法，采用约束引导生成，同时在不同约束下联合跟踪长度和答案分布，从而选择在简洁性和正确性之间达到最优平衡的响应。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，EDIT显著提高了推理效率，产生紧凑而信息丰富的输出，改善了可读性和用户体验。

Conclusion: EDIT方法有效解决了LRMs的过度思考问题，通过动态推理修剪实现了推理效率的显著提升，为大型推理模型的实用化提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward
over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to
generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide
range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are
prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple
problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted
reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we
conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set
of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple
generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,
we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference
Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct
reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while
jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,
allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between
conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,
producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user
experience.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一个强大、可扩展且自动化的流水线，能够实现LLM驱动的形式验证硬件合成，连接自然语言规范和硅实现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal
verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical
domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed
PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that
iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically
steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly
fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis
framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the
generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural
language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's
verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring
Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs
into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)
employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a
challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization
consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by
up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis
success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis
flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for
LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language
specification and silicon realization.

Abstract: Personalized AI assistants often struggle to incorporate complex personal
data and causal knowledge, leading to generic advice that lacks explanatory
power. We propose REMI, a Causal Schema Memory architecture for a multimodal
lifestyle agent that integrates a personal causal knowledge graph, a causal
reasoning engine, and a schema based planning module. The idea is to deliver
explainable, personalized recommendations in domains like fashion, personal
wellness, and lifestyle planning. Our architecture uses a personal causal graph
of the user's life events and habits, performs goal directed causal traversals
enriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, and retrieves
adaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans. A Large Language
Model orchestrates these components, producing answers with transparent causal
explanations. We outline the CSM system design and introduce new evaluation
metrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization
Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its
performance. Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context
aware, user aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents. This work
demonstrates a novel approach to memory augmented, causal reasoning in
personalized agents, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy
AI lifestyle assistants.

Motivation: 现有的文本方法在处理表格数据的复杂数值计算时存在困难，而工具集成推理方法又缺乏真正的自主适应性，需要开发能够自主执行精确数值推理的系统。

Method: 采用两阶段微调范式：先在高质量推理轨迹上进行监督微调建立有效工具使用模式，然后通过强化学习微调优化多目标策略，特别是提出了Rank-Aware Policy Optimization (RAPO)方法。

Result: 在多个主流基准测试中，TableMind相比竞争基线实现了卓越性能，在推理准确性和计算精度方面都获得了显著提升。

Conclusion: TableMind通过自主工具调用、安全代码执行和自适应策略，为表格推理任务提供了一个高效准确的解决方案，在数值计算密集型应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as
finance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models
(LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often
struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations
inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves
computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems
frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true
autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven
table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool
invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox
environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)
exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt
strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool
usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize
multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy
Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality
trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of
low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and
more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks
demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to
competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy
and computational precision.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning
and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,
especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.
Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One
such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and
reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development
of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling
and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up
pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an
autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on
context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training
recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement
learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills
while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL
recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source
LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam
benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more
insights into our methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖隐式探索，导致推理路径不稳定、缺乏错误纠正和有限的经验学习，需要更结构化的推理方法

Method: 从成功轨迹中提取结构化推理模式，从失败中获取反思信号，在推理过程中逐步遵循指导原则并在每一步后进行细化纠正

Result: 在BBH和其他四个基准测试(GSM8K、MATH-500、MBPP、HumanEval)上 consistently 超越强基线，在多样推理任务中表现优异

Conclusion: 结构化推理通过逐步执行和细化提高了稳定性和泛化能力，指导原则跨域迁移良好，支持跨模型协作，在效果和可扩展性上匹配或超越监督微调

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose reasoning, showing
strong performance across diverse tasks. However, existing methods often rely
on implicit exploration, where the model follows stochastic and unguided
reasoning paths-like walking without a map. This leads to unstable reasoning
paths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from past experience. To
address these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit
exploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we
extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and
reflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these
guidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct
errors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four
additional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks.
Structured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability
and generalization, while guidelines transfer well across domains and flexibly
support cross-model collaboration, matching or surpassing supervised
fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.

### [29] [Can AI Make Energy Retrofit Decisions? An Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06307)
*Lei Shu,Dong Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大语言模型在低程度调整下能够为住宅能源绿化改造提供有效建议，在技术目标上表现更佳，但在准确性、一致性和上下文处理方面仍需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统能源改造决策方法普遍存在普遍性不足和可解释性低的问题，而生成式AI特别是大语言模型有潜力通过处理上下文信息来提供可读的实践建议。

Method: 研究评估了7种大语言模型（ChatGPT、DeepSeek、Gemini、Grok、Llama和Claude）在两种目标下的住宅改造决策：最大化CO2减排（技术）和最小化回报期限（社会技术），使用美国49个州400房屋的数据集进行准确性、一致性、敏感性和推理能力四个维度的评估。

Result: LLM在许多情况下能生成有效建议，在不细调的情况下顶部匹配率达54.5%，前5匹配率达92.8%。在技术目标上表现更好，社会技术决策受到经济变换和本地上下文的限制。模型间一致性低，高性能模型往往与其他模型分异。LLM对地理位置和建筑形状敏感，但对技术和住户行为敏感性较低。

Conclusion: 大语言模型是能源改造决策的有前景的助手工具，但需要在准确性、一致性和上下文处理方面进一步改进才能实现可靠应用。

Abstract: Conventional approaches to building energy retrofit decision making suffer
from limited generalizability and low interpretability, hindering adoption in
diverse residential contexts. With the growth of Smart and Connected
Communities, generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), may help
by processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable
recommendations. We evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok,
Llama, and Claude) on residential retrofit decisions under two objectives:
maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period
(sociotechnical). Performance is assessed on four dimensions: accuracy,
consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning, using a dataset of 400 homes across 49
US states. LLMs generate effective recommendations in many cases, reaching up
to 54.5 percent top 1 match and 92.8 percent within top 5 without fine tuning.
Performance is stronger for the technical objective, while sociotechnical
decisions are limited by economic trade offs and local context. Agreement
across models is low, and higher performing models tend to diverge from others.
LLMs are sensitive to location and building geometry but less sensitive to
technology and occupant behavior. Most models show step by step, engineering
style reasoning, but it is often simplified and lacks deeper contextual
awareness. Overall, LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision
making, but improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling are
needed for reliable practice.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探索了使用大语言模型模拟虚拟问卷调查受访者的新方法，提出了两种模拟设置（PAS和FAS），并创建了一个综合性评测套件LLM-S^3来系统评估LLM在社会学调查模拟中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统问卷调查方法成本高、耗时长且规模有限，需要寻找更可扩展、成本效益更高的新方法来支持社会科学研究和政策评估。

Method: 提出了两种模拟设置：部分属性模拟（PAS）在部分受访者信息基础上预测缺失属性，完整属性模拟（FAS）在零上下文和上下文增强条件下生成完整合成数据集。构建了LLM-S^3评测套件，涵盖11个真实公共数据集涉及56个社会学领域。

Result: 对多个主流LLM（GPT-3.5/4 Turbo, LLaMA 3.0/3.1-8B）的评估显示了预测性能的一致趋势，持续性地呈现出了失败模式，并证明了上下文和提示设计对模拟保真度的影响。

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLM驱动的调查模拟建立了严谨的基础，为社会学研究和政策评估提供了可扩展、成本效益高的工具。

Abstract: Questionnaire-based surveys are foundational to social science research and
public policymaking, yet traditional survey methods remain costly,
time-consuming, and often limited in scale. This paper explores a new paradigm:
simulating virtual survey respondents using Large Language Models (LLMs). We
introduce two novel simulation settings, namely Partial Attribute Simulation
(PAS) and Full Attribute Simulation (FAS), to systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate accurate and demographically coherent responses. In
PAS, the model predicts missing attributes based on partial respondent
profiles, whereas FAS involves generating complete synthetic datasets under
both zero-context and context-enhanced conditions. We curate a comprehensive
benchmark suite, LLM-S^3 (Large Language Model-based Sociodemographic Survey
Simulation), that spans 11 real-world public datasets across four sociological
domains. Our evaluation of multiple mainstream LLMs (GPT-3.5/4 Turbo, LLaMA
3.0/3.1-8B) reveals consistent trends in prediction performance, highlights
failure modes, and demonstrates how context and prompt design impact simulation
fidelity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for LLM-driven survey
simulations, offering scalable and cost-effective tools for sociological
research and policy evaluation. Our code and dataset are available at:

Conclusion: 该框架为评估LLM卖家代理的议价能力提供了系统化的解决方案，通过意图跟踪和理论心理基础的方法，能够更全面地评估代理在复杂谈判场景中的表现。

Abstract: In online second-hand marketplaces, multi-turn bargaining is a crucial part
of seller-buyer interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as seller
agents, negotiating with buyers on behalf of sellers under given business
constraints. A critical ability for such agents is to track and accurately
interpret cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations, which directly
impacts bargaining effectiveness. We introduce a multi-turn evaluation
framework for measuring the bargaining ability of seller agents in e-commerce
dialogues. The framework tests whether an agent can extract and track buyer
intents. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale e-commerce bargaining
benchmark spanning 622 categories, 9,892 products, and 3,014 tasks; (2) a
turn-level evaluation framework grounded in Theory of Mind (ToM) with annotated
buyer intents, moving beyond outcome-only metrics; and (3) an automated
pipeline that extracts reliable intent from massive dialogue data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代复杂多智能体交互的模拟环境需要在高度细节保真度和计算效率之间取得平衡，需要一种能够准确模拟战略规划同时保持计算效率的方法。

Method: 使用路径点系统简化和离散化连续状态和动作，配合基于真实CS:GO比赛数据训练的神经预测和生成模型来重建事件结果，仅通过移动决策模拟战术定位，无需显式建模瞄准和射击等低层机制。

Conclusion: DECOY提供了一个有价值的公开模拟环境，可用于推进战略多智能体规划和行为生成的研究，在保持环境保真度的同时实现了计算效率的平衡。

Abstract: Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must
balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a
novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in
3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level
environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a
testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement
decisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level
mechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint
system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired
with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament
data to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays
generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original
game. Our publicly available simulation environment provides a valuable tool
for advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior

fine-tuning to general-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) to emulate
radiologists' stepwise diagnostic reasoning using only free-text reports.
DiagCoT combines contrastive image-report tuning for domain alignment,
chain-of-thought supervision to capture inferential logic, and reinforcement
tuning with clinical reward signals to enhance factual accuracy and fluency. On
the MIMIC-CXR benchmark, DiagCoT improved zero-shot disease classification AUC
from 0.52 to 0.76 (absolute gain of 0.24), pathology grounding mIoU from 0.08
to 0.31 (absolute gain of 0.23), and report generation BLEU from 0.11 to 0.33

LLaVA-Med and CXR-LLAVA on long-tailed diseases and external datasets. By
converting unstructured clinical narratives into structured supervision,
DiagCoT offers a scalable approach for developing interpretable and
diagnostically competent AI systems for radiology.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型处理长文本任务时存在的'中间信息丢失'问题，现有方法要么可能丢弃关键信息，要么导致注意力分散

Method: 将输入分段由独立智能体处理，生成局部认知后通过树状结构路径动态交换信息进行协作推理，结合前缀哈希缓存和自适应剪枝策略

Result: 基于LLaMA3.1-8B的TOA在多种长文本任务上显著超越多个基线模型，性能可与更大的商业模型(Gemini1.5-pro)相媲美

Conclusion: TOA框架有效缓解了位置偏见和幻觉问题，在可比的API开销下实现了显著的性能提升，为长文本处理提供了有效的多智能体解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling
long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where
information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized.
Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key
information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention
dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a
multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed
by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents
dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along
tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders
for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and
reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate
prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant
performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that
TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple
baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger
commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyFedRAG是一个面向混合数据模态的联邦RAG框架，通过边缘-云协作机制在保护数据隐私的同时处理异构医疗数据，在检索质量、生成一致性和系统效率方面优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式RAG系统在处理异构和隐私敏感的医疗数据时面临困难，特别是在分布式医疗环境中，患者数据涵盖SQL、知识图谱和临床笔记等多种格式，且存在隐私约束限制罕见病例检索。

Method: 1) 基于Flower设计边缘-云协作RAG框架，支持查询结构化SQL数据、半结构化知识图谱和非结构化文档；2) 集成轻量级本地检索器和隐私感知LLM，提供三种匿名化工具；3) 设计三层缓存策略优化响应延迟。

Result: 在PMC-Patients数据集上的实验结果表明，HyFedRAG在检索质量、生成一致性和系统效率方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为结构异构数据上的RAG提供了可扩展且符合隐私要求的解决方案，在敏感和多样化数据环境中释放了LLM的潜力。

Abstract: Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive
data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans
SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties
retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of
traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge
devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient
Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an
edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across
diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:
(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which
supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and
unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into
standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs
integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate
lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three
anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,
de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize
response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier
caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,
and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate
that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality,
generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable
and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data,
unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在下游任务中的应用需求增长，提高模型对齐性能和效率变得至关重要。但由于指令集分布的复杂性，当前的指令集精细方法无法随着指令池扩展而持续改善性能。

Method: 首先研究指令数据集分布与对齐模型性能关系的关键因素，发现指令深度和语义空间覆盖度是关键因素，然后设计了一种同时最大化深度和语义覆盖的指令选择算法。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法能够解释模型在开发集上超过70%的损失，与最先进的基准方法相比，能够以更快的速度持续提高模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的指令选择方法通过重视指令深度和语义覆盖度，有效解决了随指令池扩展性能无法持续改善的问题，实现了加速缩放的效果。

Abstract: With the growing demand for applying large language models to downstream
tasks, improving model alignment performance and efficiency has become crucial.
Such a process involves selecting informative instructions from a candidate
pool. However, due to the complexity of instruction set distributions, the key
factors driving the performance of aligned models remain unclear. As a result,
current instruction set refinement methods fail to improve performance as the
instruction pool expands continuously. To address this issue, we first
investigate the key factors that influence the relationship between instruction
dataset distribution and aligned model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a novel instruction data selection method. We identify that the depth
of instructions and the coverage of the semantic space are the crucial factors
determining downstream performance, which could explain over 70\% of the model
loss on the development set. We then design an instruction selection algorithm
to simultaneously maximize the depth and semantic coverage of the selected
instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to
state-of-the-art baseline methods, it can sustainably improve model performance
at a faster pace and thus achieve \emph{``Accelerated Scaling''}.

Motivation: 当前缺乏系统评估GUI操作与快捷方式（API、深度链接等）混合智能体的框架，需要建立基准来推动更高效GUI代理的发展。

Method: 构建包含139个跨11个真实应用复杂任务的基准，提供88个预定义快捷方式知识库，设计可通过GUI操作解决但能通过智能嵌入快捷方式显著加速的任务。

Result: 实验显示混合代理相比纯GUI代理显著提高了成功率和效率，验证了评估代理快捷方式生成能力的有效性。

Conclusion: MAS-Bench填补了关键评估空白，为创建更高效、鲁棒智能体的未来发展提供了基础平台。

Abstract: To enhance the efficiency of GUI agents on various platforms like smartphones
and computers, a hybrid paradigm that combines flexible GUI operations with
efficient shortcuts (e.g., API, deep links) is emerging as a promising
direction. However, a framework for systematically benchmarking these hybrid
agents is still underexplored. To take the first step in bridging this gap, we
introduce MAS-Bench, a benchmark that pioneers the evaluation of GUI-shortcut
hybrid agents with a specific focus on the mobile domain. Beyond merely using
predefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously
generate shortcuts by discovering and creating reusable, low-cost workflows. It
features 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base
of 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation
metrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can
be significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts. Experiments
show that hybrid agents achieve significantly higher success rates and
efficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. This result also demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method for evaluating an agent's shortcut generation
capabilities. MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap, providing a
foundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and
robust intelligent agents.

Abstract: In supply chain management, decision-making often involves balancing multiple
conflicting objectives, such as cost reduction, service level improvement, and
environmental sustainability. Traditional multi-objective optimization methods,
such as linear programming and evolutionary algorithms, struggle to adapt in
real-time to the dynamic nature of supply chains. In this paper, we propose an
approach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to address these challenges for dynamic
multi-objective optimization under uncertainty. Our method leverages MOEAs to
search the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front
of policies. This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of
policies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system
objectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.
We also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate
risk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,
showcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study. The proposed
strategy not only improves decision-making efficiency but also offers a more
robust framework for managing uncertainty and optimizing performance in supply
chains.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem
proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by
challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and
inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system
designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary
innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for
continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This
framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage
expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and
periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail
long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced
multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference
time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level
planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler
subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,
enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by
leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to
scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics
benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F
and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal
mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of
broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon
multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

Abstract: The cycle of scientific discovery is frequently bottlenecked by the slow,
manual creation of software to support computational experiments. To address
this, we present an AI system that creates expert-level scientific software
whose goal is to maximize a quality metric. The system uses a Large Language

and intelligently navigate the large space of possible solutions. The system
achieves expert-level results when it explores and integrates complex research
ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated
across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel
methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed

*Zhou-Peng Shou,Zhi-Qiang You,Fang Wang,Hai-Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于"意图草笼"的零样本多模态推理组件，通过明确的"理解-规划-选择"认知过程来提升复杂跨模态推理能力，可以不经过参数微调实现跨模型转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大模型在复杂跨模态推理中存在的"路径短接"和上下文理解不充问题。

Method: 设计了一个即插即用的三模块流水线：意图感知器、策略生成器和策略选择器，通过生成和筛选"意图草笼"策略来指导最终推理。

Result: 在IntentBench、WorldSense和Daily-Omni数据集上验证了方法的通用性和稳健性，相比各自基线最高提升约9.51个百分点。

Conclusion: 信息论分析显示该方法能够降低条件熵和提高信息利用效率，压制意外的短接推理，证明了"意图草笼"推理组件在零样本场景下的实用价值和可移植性。

Abstract: Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding
in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper
proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like
cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a
plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and
Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select"
cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to
guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves
cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering.
Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional
entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing
unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and
Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with
their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields
consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline
combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points,
demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch"
reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

TL;DR: 提出了State-based Function Call (SFC)方法，在车载环境中通过直接状态预测和状态转换，显著优于传统函数调用方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能座舱API代理面临紧密耦合子系统的协调挑战，传统函数调用方法需要多次探索性调用来建立环境感知，导致效率低下和错误恢复能力有限

Method: 开发了VehicleWorld车载环境（30个模块、250个API、680个属性），提出基于状态的函数调用(SFC)方法，维护显式系统状态感知并实现直接状态转换

Result: SFC方法显著优于传统FC方法，实现了更高的执行准确性和更低的延迟

Conclusion: 直接状态预测在环境控制方面优于函数调用，SFC方法为车载智能系统提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents,
requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical
task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches
operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build
environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited
error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment
for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties
with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information
during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle
agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic
analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function
calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose
State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit
system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve
target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly
outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy
and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on
Github https://github.com/OpenMOSS/VehicleWorld.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个评估迭代精炼的框架，用于测量大语言模型在多轮工作流中的表现，发现不同领域的迭代效果存在显著差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型已经被广泛用于多轮工作流，但仍缺乏明确的方法来评估迭代精炼的效果，需要一个统一的评测框架

Method: 设计了一个评估协议，在思想、代码和数学任务中进行12轮的受控对话，使用从模糊到有针对性的各种提示，并记录每轮输出

Result: 发现赢得是领域依赖的：思想和代码在早期轮次获得收益，而数学在后期轮次重要。模糊反馈常导致平台期或正确性倒退，而有针对性的提示能可靠地提升指定质量轴

Conclusion: 该框架和指标使得迭代可以在不同模型之间进行测量和比较，并为何时轻控、停止或切换策略提供信号

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in multi-turn workflows, but we
still lack a clear way to measure when iteration helps and when it hurts. We
present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation,
code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task,
utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to
targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with
domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus
reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and
track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement
across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and
tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in
math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns,
vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts
reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation;
speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and
drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation
moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little
semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late,
elaborative iteration.Together, the framework and metrics make iteration
measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or
switch strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAFFLES是一个用于评估长时程多组件LLM代理系统的迭代式评估架构，通过推理和迭代精化来诊断系统故障点，在Who&When数据集上显著超越了现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理系统的评估方法存在局限性，主要关注单一指标或端到端结果，难以诊断复杂长时程系统中故障的具体位置和原因。需要能够推理、探测、迭代和理解系统复杂逻辑的评估框架。

Method: RAFFLES采用迭代式多组件流水线架构，包含一个中央Judge来系统调查故障，以及一组专门的Evaluators来评估系统组件和Judge自身的推理质量，构建假设历史。

Result: 在Who&When数据集上，RAFFLES在算法生成数据集上达到43%以上的代理-步骤故障对准确率（相比之前最佳16.6%大幅提升），在手工制作数据集上达到20%以上（超越之前最佳8.8%）。

Conclusion: RAFFLES展示了为自主系统引入自动化故障检测的重要进展，相比劳动密集型人工审查具有显著优势，是解决长时程多组件LLM代理系统故障诊断难题的关键一步。

Abstract: We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of
long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to
identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that
currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that
they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,
and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match
the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,
probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems
over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation
architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.
Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using
a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized
Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of
the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We
tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark
designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.
RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair
accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial
increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the
Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These
results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection
for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

*James Xu Zhao,Bryan Hooi,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过对12个推理模型的综合评估，发现测试时扩展计算（test-time scaling）在知识密集任务中并不能持续提高准确性，反而可能导致更多幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时扩展技术虽然在多个领域表现优异，但在知识密集任务中的效果仍未明确，特别是在供应高事实准确性和低幻觉率的场景下。需要识别该方法的局限性和潜在风险。

Method: 使用12个推理模型在两个知识密集测试集上进行综合评估，分析测试时扩展对准确性和幻觉率的影响，通过案例研究探索扩展推理如何引发确认偏见和过份自信的幻觉。

Result: 增加测试时计算并不能持续提高准确性，在许多情况下反而会导致更多幻觉。幻觉率的降低常常来自模型选择在更长思考后放弃回答，而非改善事实记忆。反之，更长的推理可能鼓励模型尝试回答之前未回答的问题，其中许多导致幻觉。

Conclusion: 虽然测试时扩展存在局限性，但与不启用推理的情况相比，启用思考仍然有益。该研究为知识密集任务中的测试时扩展提供了重要的诊断和见解，帮助识别并减少幻觉风险。

Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to
generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many
domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective
for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low
hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive
benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not
consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more
hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination
behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model
choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual
recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on
previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case
studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to
overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that
compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统研究论文需要读者投入大量精力理解和适应代码、数据和方法，阻碍了传播和重用。Paper2Agent旨在解决这一挑战，将被动研究成果转化为主动系统。

Method: 使用多代理系统分析论文和相关代码库，构建模型上下文协议(MCP)服务器，通过迭代生成和运行测试来优化MCP。然后将论文MCP与聊天代理连接，通过自然语言执行科学查询。

Result: 通过深度案例研究验证有效性，成功创建了基于AlphaGenome、ScanPy和TISSUE的论文代理，能够重现原始论文结果并正确执行新用户查询。

Conclusion: Paper2Agent将静态论文转化为动态交互式AI代理，为知识传播和AI协作生态系统奠定了基础新范式。

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research
papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive
artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and
discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial
effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own
work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this
challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a
knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the
associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol
(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify
the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat
agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through
natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We
demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper
agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that
leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy
and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We
validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and
can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into
dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for
knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI
co-scientists.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型人类偏好对齐方法存在两个主要问题：(1)依赖多步去噪梯度计算，计算成本高，限制优化步数；(2)需要持续离线调整奖励模型来达到期望的美学质量

Method: 提出Direct-Align方法预定义噪声先验，通过插值从任意时间步恢复原始图像；引入语义相对偏好优化(SRPO)，将奖励构建为文本条件信号，支持在线奖励调整

Result: 通过优化去噪和在线奖励调整对FLUX.1.dev模型进行微调，人类评估的真实感和美学质量提升超过3倍

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了扩散模型人类偏好对齐的计算效率和离线依赖问题，显著提升了生成图像的质量

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning
diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However,
they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with
gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,
thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often
need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired
aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address
the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that
predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time
steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are
interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids
over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic
Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as
text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in
response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the
reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model
with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its
human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型生成的综合代理是否可以作为真实参与者的替代品用于人类主体研究，而不仅仅是关注其生成的调查数据是否与人类相似。

Method: 设计了一个研究方案，包括(a)揭示代理的内部状态，(b)在基本对话环境中检验代理行为，通过一系列行为假设来评估代理在对话中的行为是否与其揭示的内部状态保持一致性。

Result: 在不同模型家族和不同模型大小中都发现了显著的内部不一致性。虽然代理可能生成与人类对应者相匹配的回复，但它们缺乏内部一致性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在人类主体研究中无法准确替代真实参与者，因为它们缺乏内部一致性这一关键能力缺口。

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

Abstract: This paper investigates discrete unit representations in Speech Language
Models (SLMs), focusing on optimizing speech modeling during continual
pre-training. In this paper, we systematically examine how model architecture,
data representation, and training robustness influence the pre-training stage

Our experiments highlight the role of speech encoders and clustering
granularity across different model scales, showing how optimal discretization
strategies vary with model capacity. By examining cluster distribution and
phonemic alignments, we investigate the effective use of discrete vocabulary,
uncovering both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns. Additionally, we
explore the impact of clustering data selection on model robustness,
highlighting the importance of domain matching between discretization training

Conclusion: 提出的N-Gram张量方法能够更有效地检测大语言模型的幻觉现象，为提升模型生成内容的可靠性提供了新的技术途径

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness across a wide
variety of tasks involving natural language, however, a fundamental problem of
hallucinations still plagues these models, limiting their trustworthiness in
generating consistent, truthful information. Detecting hallucinations has
quickly become an important topic, with various methods such as uncertainty
estimation, LLM Judges, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and consistency
checks showing promise. Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics,
such as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth
necessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor
from LLM-generated text. This tensor captures richer semantic structure by
encoding co-occurrence patterns, enabling better differentiation between
factual and hallucinated content. We demonstrate this by applying tensor
decomposition methods to extract singular values from each mode and use these
as input features to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated on the HaluEval dataset and
demonstrates significant improvements over traditional baselines, as well as
competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges.

Motivation: 大语言模型在推理时无法持续适应和学习新数据，限制了其在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Method: SAGE包含三个核心组件：触发模块实时检测推理失败，触发缓冲模块使用HDBSCAN聚类异常样本并进行稳定性检查，Lora存储模块通过适配器池动态优化参数更新。

Result: 评估结果显示SAGE在原子推理子任务上通过动态知识更新表现出优秀的准确性、鲁棒性和稳定性。

Conclusion: SAGE框架成功解决了大语言模型在推理时无法持续学习的问题，为复杂推理任务提供了有效的动态适应方案。

Abstract: Large language models are unable to continuously adapt and learn from new
data during reasoning at inference time. To address this limitation, we propose
that complex reasoning tasks be decomposed into atomic subtasks and introduce
SAGE, a trigger-guided dynamic fine-tuning framework that enables adaptive
updates during reasoning at inference time. SAGE consists of three key
components: (1) a Trigger module that detects reasoning failures through
multiple evaluation metrics in real time; (2) a Trigger Buffer module that
clusters anomaly samples using a streaming clustering process with HDBSCAN,
followed by stability checks and similarity-based merging; and (3) a Lora Store
module that dynamically optimizes parameter updates with an adapter pool for
knowledge retention. Evaluation results show that SAGE demonstrates excellent
accuracy, robustness, and stability on the atomic reasoning subtask through
dynamic knowledge updating during test time.

Motivation: 探索模型能力多样性如何影响多智能体辩论的动态和结果，此前研究只关注同质群体。

Method: 通过一系列实验分析多智能体辩论过程，观察模型在辩论中的行为变化。

Result: 辩论会导致准确率随时间下降，模型经常从正确答案转向错误答案，倾向于达成共识而非挑战错误推理。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论存在重要失败模式，当智能体既无激励也无足够能力抵抗有说服力但错误的推理时，简单的辩论应用可能导致性能下降。

Abstract: While multi-agent debate has been proposed as a promising strategy for
improving AI reasoning ability, we find that debate can sometimes be harmful
rather than helpful. The prior work has exclusively focused on debates within
homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model
capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions.
Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a
decrease in accuracy over time -- even in settings where stronger (i.e., more
capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that
models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer
reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. These results
highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent
debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance
degradation when agents are neither incentivized nor adequately equipped to
resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.

Method: 使用词正划比率、词段计数和语言元数据（语系、文字、地区）等少量特征，通过梯度提升模型进行预测

Result: 在203种语言上达到了良好性能（XX→英语R²=0.66，英语→XX R²=0.72），语言类型学因素对英语翻译预测最重要，词正划比率则在多样化目标语中更关键

Conclusion: 翻译质量受到词级别词正划比率和更广泛语言类型学的共同影响，为多语言评估和质量估计提供了新视角

Abstract: We show that translation quality can be predicted with surprising accuracy
\textit{without ever running the translation system itself}. Using only a
handful of features, token fertility ratios, token counts, and basic linguistic
metadata (language family, script, and region), we can forecast ChrF scores for
GPT-4o translations across 203 languages in the FLORES-200 benchmark. Gradient
boosting models achieve favorable performance ($R^{2}=0.66$ for
XX$\rightarrow$English and $R^{2}=0.72$ for English$\rightarrow$XX). Feature
importance analyses reveal that typological factors dominate predictions into
English, while fertility plays a larger role for translations into diverse
target languages. These findings suggest that translation quality is shaped by
both token-level fertility and broader linguistic typology, offering new
insights for multilingual evaluation and quality estimation.

*Aivin V. Solatorio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN) 是一种展示层协议，通过机械验证确保大语言模型生成数字的准确性，将验证放在渲染器而非模型中，防止数字幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型作为随机系统可能生成与可用数据不符的数字，现有保护措施无法保证数字保真度，需要一种能够强制验证数字准确性的机制

Method: PCN协议将数字作为声明绑定令牌发出，验证器根据声明的策略（如精确相等、舍入、别名或容差）检查每个令牌，验证在渲染器中进行

Result: PCN被形式化并证明了可靠性、诚实令牌下的完备性、故障关闭行为和策略精化下的单调性，具有轻量级、模型无关的特点

Conclusion: PCN通过在显示前强制验证，为数字敏感场景建立了简单契约：只有通过证明才能获得信任，而缺少标记则传达不确定性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as stochastic systems may generate numbers that
deviate from available data, a failure known as \emph{numeric hallucination}.
Existing safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and
uncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity:
fabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose
\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that
enforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric
spans are emitted as \emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a
verifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,
rounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places
verification in the \emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers
are marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation
prevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and
prove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and
monotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,
integrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with
cryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before
display, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:
\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates
uncertainty.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型被广泛用于自动评估自由形式内容，需要一种能够给单个摘要赋予绝对分数的方法，以满足需要阈值处理的应用场景。

Method: 提出直接评分方法，通过使用合成摘要来模拟人工双向比较排序，从而能够对单个摘要进行绝对评分。

Result: 在SummEval（+0.03）、TopicalChat（-0.03）和HANNA（+0.05）评测数据集上，该方法与最先进的双向比较评估方法在样本级相关性方面表现相似。

Conclusion: 该方法为摘要评估提供了一种能够赋予绝对分数的有效方式，补充了传统双向比较方法的不足，并为未来研究提供了合成上下文摘要数据。

Abstract: As large-language models have been increasingly used as automatic raters for
evaluating free-form content, including document summarization, dialog, and
story generation, work has been dedicated to evaluating such models by
measuring their correlations with human judgment. For \textit{sample-level}
performance, methods which operate by using pairwise comparisons between
machine-generated text perform well but often lack the ability to assign
absolute scores to individual summaries, an ability crucial for use cases that
require thresholding. In this work, we propose a direct-scoring method which
uses synthetic summaries to act as pairwise machine rankings at test time. We
show that our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art pairwise
evaluators in terms of axis-averaged sample-level correlations on the SummEval
(\textbf{+0.03}), TopicalChat (\textbf{-0.03}), and HANNA (\textbf{+0.05})
meta-evaluation benchmarks, and release the synthetic in-context summaries as
data to facilitate future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院呼叫中心产生大量员工消息数据，但传统监督学习需要注释数据和谨慎调整，LLM提供了更高效的分析方法。

Method: 提出多阶段LLM框架，评估包括推理、通用和轻量级模型在内的多种LLM类型，并结合数据安全措施和HIPAA合规要求。

Result: o3模型表现最佳，达到78.4%加权F1分数和79.2%准确率，gpt-5以次，达到75.3%加权F1分数和76.2%准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效利用员工消息数据，识别导航员培训机会，支持改善患者体验和护理质量，并集成到可视化决策支持工具中。

Abstract: Hospital call centers serve as the primary contact point for patients within
a hospital system. They also generate substantial volumes of staff messages as
navigators process patient requests and communicate with the hospital offices
following the established protocol restrictions and guidelines. This
continuously accumulated large amount of text data can be mined and processed
to retrieve insights; however, traditional supervised learning approaches
require annotated data, extensive training, and model tuning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer a paradigm shift toward more computationally efficient
methodologies for healthcare analytics. This paper presents a multi-stage
LLM-based framework that identifies staff message topics and classifies
messages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion. In the process, multiple
LLM types, including reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models, were
evaluated. The best-performing model was o3, achieving 78.4% weighted F1-score
and 79.2% accuracy, followed closely by gpt-5 (75.3% Weighted F1-score and
76.2% accuracy). The proposed methodology incorporates data security measures
and HIPAA compliance requirements essential for healthcare environments. The
processed LLM outputs are integrated into a visualization decision support tool
that transforms the staff messages into actionable insights accessible to
healthcare professionals. This approach enables more efficient utilization of
the collected staff messaging data, identifies navigator training
opportunities, and supports improved patient experience and care quality.

Motivation: 研究词汇分割效率对形态复杂、低资源语言的结构性不利影响，这些语言需要更多计算资源且准确率较低

Method: 评估10个大语言模型在AfriMMLU数据集上的表现，包含9,000个多选题、5个科目、16种非洲语言，分析词汇分割效率与准确率的关系

Result: 词汇分割效率（tokens/word）能可靠预测准确率，效率越高准确率越低；推理模型在所有语言上都优于非推理模型；token数量翻倍会导致训练成本和时间增加四倍

Conclusion: 需要开发形态学感知的词汇分割方法、公平定价策略和多语言基准测试，以实现更公平的自然语言处理

Abstract: Tokenization inefficiency imposes structural disadvantages on morphologically
complex, low-resource languages, inflating compute resources and depressing
accuracy. We evaluate 10 large language models (LLMs) on AfriMMLU (9,000 MCQA
items; 5 subjects; 16 African languages) and show that fertility (tokens/word)
reliably predicts accuracy. Higher fertility consistently predicts lower
accuracy across all models and subjects. We further find that reasoning models
(DeepSeek, o1) consistently outperform non-reasoning peers across high and low
resource languages in the AfriMMLU dataset, narrowing accuracy gaps observed in
prior generations. Finally, translating token inflation to economics, a
doubling in tokens results in quadrupled training cost and time, underscoring
the token tax faced by many languages. These results motivate morphologically
aware tokenization, fair pricing, and multilingual benchmarks for equitable
natural language processing (NLP).

Abstract: This work presents a Biomedical Literature Question Answering (Q&A) system
based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, designed to
improve access to accurate, evidence-based medical information. Addressing the
shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access
to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed
articles, curated Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant
information and generate concise, context-aware responses. The retrieval
pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while
answer generation is performed by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model
optimized using QLoRA for efficient, low-resource training. The system supports
both general medical queries and domain-specific tasks, with a focused
evaluation on breast cancer literature demonstrating the value of
domain-aligned retrieval. Empirical results, measured using BERTScore (F1),
show substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance
compared to baseline models. The findings underscore the potential of
RAG-enhanced language models to bridge the gap between complex biomedical
literature and accessible public health knowledge, paving the way for future
work on multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized
medical AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI领域的基本问题：大语言模型是否真正理解概念还是仅仅识别表面模式。真正的理解应该自然允许可逆变换。

Method: 提出双向推理概念，并开发对比微调(CFT)方法，使用三类示例：保持语义的正示例、语义不同的负示例、以及前向方向的雷同示例。

Result: 实验显示对比微调成功实现了双向推理，在保持前向任务能力的同时得到了强大的逆向性能。发现了认知专门化现象：细调前向任务会导致反向推理能力显著下降。

Conclusion: 双向推理既是评估真正理解的理论框架，也是开发更强大AI系统的实践训练方法，能够发展深度理解而非表面模式识别。

Abstract: This research addresses a fundamental question in AI: whether large language
models truly understand concepts or simply recognize patterns. The authors
propose bidirectional reasoning,the ability to apply transformations in both
directions without being explicitly trained on the reverse direction, as a test
for genuine understanding. They argue that true comprehension should naturally
allow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like
userIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index
without reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and
discovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned
on forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability
to reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue,
they developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three
types of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative
examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples.
This approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level
pattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally
without explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT
successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse
performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. The authors conclude
that bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for
assessing genuine understanding and as a practical training approach for
developing more capable AI systems.

Motivation: 探讨人们如何为从未讨论过的事物建立共享命名系统，检验是形成任意标签联系还是进行概念协调的两种对立观点。

Method: 使用KiloGram数据集中的1000多个抽象七巧板图像，通过302对参与者的对话研究，测量他们对未讨论图像的描述一致性。

Result: 发现了强烈的泛化证据：伙伴间的描述一致性显著提高；泛化程度随视觉相似性非线性衰减；在不同可命名性水平上都表现稳健。

Conclusion: 临时命名约定不是任意的标签，而是反映了真正的概念协调，这对指称理论和设计更自适应的语言代理具有重要意义。

Abstract: How do people talk about things they've never talked about before? One view
suggests that a new shared naming system establishes an arbitrary link to a
specific target, like proper names that cannot extend beyond their bearers. An
alternative view proposes that forming a shared way of describing objects
involves broader conceptual alignment, reshaping each individual's semantic
space in ways that should generalize to new referents. We test these competing
accounts in a dyadic communication study (N=302) leveraging the
recently-released KiloGram dataset containing over 1,000 abstract tangram
images. After pairs of participants coordinated on referential conventions for
one set of images through repeated communication, we measured the extent to
which their descriptions aligned for undiscussed images. We found strong
evidence for generalization: partners showed increased alignment relative to
their pre-test labels. Generalization also decayed nonlinearly with visual
similarity (consistent with Shepard's law) and was robust across levels of the
images' nameability. These findings suggest that ad hoc conventions are not
arbitrary labels but reflect genuine conceptual coordination, with implications
for theories of reference and the design of more adaptive language agents.

Motivation: 大语言模型生成的思维链数据可能包含噪声推理，这些推理要么无法支持答案，要么对答案预测没有额外帮助，导致小语言模型学习到虚假的相关性，影响推理质量。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Thought Correctness Perception Distillation (CoPeD)：1) 正确性感知任务设置，鼓励模型基于正确推理预测答案并修正错误推理；2) 正确性感知加权损失，根据推理和答案的联合损失动态调整训练样本权重。

Result: 实验表明CoPeD在分布内和分布外基准推理数据集上都有效。

Conclusion: CoPeD通过改进任务设置和数据利用方式，有效提升了小语言模型的推理质量，特别是在处理噪声推理数据方面表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks but are expensive to
deploy. Thus small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on CoT data generated
by LLMs to copy LLMs' abilities. However, these CoT data may include noisy
rationales that either fail to substantiate the answers or contribute no
additional information to support answer prediction, which leads SLMs to
capture spurious correlations between questions and answers and compromise the
quality of reasoning. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness
Perception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of
the student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization.
Firstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the
student model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them
when they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning
and allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a
Correctness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of
each training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the
answer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the
rationale offers stronger support for the correct answer. Experiments have
shown that CoPeD is effective on both in-distribution (IND) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: Icon²通过利用LLM表示空间的内在调节机制，实现了高效且定制化的偏好数据集构建，显著提升了模型对齐性能并大幅降低了计算开销

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality preference datasets to
align with human preferences. However, conventional methods for constructing
such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected
instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while
the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging
inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored
preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first
extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences
and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on
their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is
applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of
response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency.
Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve an average win rate improvement of 13.89% on
AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by
up to 48.1%.

Conclusion: 该方法通过检测角度处理对齐问题，有效解决了音响-语言表示匹配中的结构性不对称和分布不匹配问题

Abstract: Aligning acoustic and linguistic representations is a central challenge to
bridge the pre-trained models in knowledge transfer for automatic speech
recognition (ASR). This alignment is inherently structured and asymmetric:
while multiple consecutive acoustic frames typically correspond to a single
linguistic token (many-to-one), certain acoustic transition regions may relate
to multiple adjacent tokens (one-to-many). Moreover, acoustic sequences often
include frames with no linguistic counterpart, such as background noise or
silence may lead to imbalanced matching conditions. In this work, we take a new
insight to regard alignment and matching as a detection problem, where the goal
is to identify meaningful correspondences with high precision and recall
ensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while flexibly handling redundant
or noisy acoustic frames in transferring linguistic knowledge for ASR. Based on
this new insight, we propose an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment
model that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural
asymmetries with soft and partial matching between acoustic and linguistic
modalities. Our method ensures that every linguistic token is grounded in at
least one acoustic observation, while allowing for flexible, probabilistic
mappings from acoustic to linguistic units. We evaluate our proposed model with
experiments on an CTC-based ASR system with a pre-trained language model for
knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in flexibly controlling degree of matching and hence to improve ASR
performance.

Abstract: The emotional content of song lyrics plays a pivotal role in shaping listener
experiences and influencing musical preferences. This paper investigates the
task of multi-label emotional attribution of song lyrics by predicting six
emotional intensity scores corresponding to six fundamental emotions. A
manually labeled dataset is constructed using a mean opinion score (MOS)
approach, which aggregates annotations from multiple human raters to ensure
reliable ground-truth labels. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of several publicly available large language models
(LLMs) under zero-shot scenarios. Additionally, we fine-tune a BERT-based model
specifically for predicting multi-label emotion scores. Experimental results
reveal the relative strengths and limitations of zero-shot and fine-tuned
models in capturing the nuanced emotional content of lyrics. Our findings
highlight the potential of LLMs for emotion recognition in creative texts,
providing insights into model selection strategies for emotion-based music
information retrieval applications. The labeled dataset is available at

Abstract: Intent detection is a crucial component of modern conversational systems,
since accurately identifying user intent at the beginning of a conversation is
essential for generating effective responses. Recent efforts have focused on
studying this problem under a challenging few-shot scenario. These approaches
primarily leverage large-scale unlabeled dialogue text corpora to pretrain
language models through various pretext tasks, followed by fine-tuning for
intent detection with very limited annotations. Despite the improvements
achieved, existing methods have predominantly focused on textual data,
neglecting to effectively capture the crucial structural information inherent
in conversational systems, such as the query-query relation and query-answer
relation. To address this gap, we propose SAID, a novel framework that
integrates both textual and relational structure information in a unified
manner for model pretraining for the first time. Building on this framework, we
further propose a novel mechanism, the query-adaptive attention network
(QueryAdapt), which operates at the relation token level by generating
intent-specific relation tokens from well-learned query-query and query-answer
relations explicitly, enabling more fine-grained knowledge transfer. Extensive
experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAID
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for
solving complex optimization problems, including Neural Architecture Search
(NAS). However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt
engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and
scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel
framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization
without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our
approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural
architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We
also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select
high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning
samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our
curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs,
encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain
(e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA
configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search. The
datasets and models will be released at https://github.com/Ashone3/LM-Searcher.

### [69] [Cross-Question Method Reuse in Large Language Models: From Word-Level Prediction to Rational Logical-Layer Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05660)
*Hong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展方法重用范围的新方法，能够处理相似度低或具有隐藏相似性的问题，通过分离问题和解决方案，指导LLM专注于解决方案迁移而非问题识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法重用通常要求问题高度相似，限制了应用范围。本文旨在扩展方法重用，使其能够处理相似度低或具有隐藏相似性的问题，实现跨问题的方法重用。

Method: 首先将问题和解决方案分离，而不是直接将问题-解决方案对输入LLM。然后指导LLM将解决方案适配到新的相关问题上，使其专注于解决方案迁移而非问题识别。对于仅共享部分特征或隐藏特征的问题，也采用类似方法。

Result: 实验验证表明，该范围扩展方法提高了筛选出可重用解决方案的概率，从而提升了跨问题方法重用的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了方法重用的范围，能够处理相似度低或具有隐藏相似性的问题，提高了跨问题方法重用的效果，为LLM在更广泛场景中的应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist in finding
solutions for diverse questions. Prior work has proposed representing a method
as a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse.
However, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly
similar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address
questions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not
explicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific
sense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the
question and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The
LLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing
it to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore,
we extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or
hidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond
conventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our
scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable
solutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.

TL;DR: Llama-GENBA-10B是一个10B参数的三语基础模型，基于Llama 3.1-8B构建，针对英语、德语和巴伐利亚语进行训练，解决了大型语言模型中的英语中心偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型中的英语中心偏见，为德语NLP社区提供支持，并促进低资源语言巴伐利亚语的发展。

Method: 基于Llama 3.1-8B扩展到10B参数，在164B tokens（82B英语、82B德语、80M巴伐利亚语）上进行持续预训练，创建统一的分词器，优化架构和语言比例超参数，建立首个标准化三语评估套件。

Result: 模型在跨语言性能上表现强劲，微调变体在巴伐利亚语上超越Apertus-8B-2509和gemma-2-9b，成为该语言类别中最佳模型，同时在英语上优于EuroLLM，在德语上与EuroLLM持平。

Conclusion: 该研究为整合低资源语言的包容性基础模型提供了蓝图，展示了在Cerebras CS-2上进行高效大规模多语言预训练的可行性，并记录了能源使用情况。

Abstract: We present Llama-GENBA-10B, a trilingual foundation model addressing
English-centric bias in large language models. Built on Llama 3.1-8B and scaled
to 10B parameters, Llama-GENBA-10B is continuously pretrained on 164B tokens
(82B English, 82B German, and 80M Bavarian), balancing resources while
preventing English dominance. Targeted at the German NLP community, the model
also promotes Bavarian as a low-resource language. Development tackled four
challenges: (1) curating a multilingual corpus despite Bavarian scarcity, (2)
creating a unified tokenizer for English, German, and Bavarian, (3) optimizing
architecture and language-ratio hyperparameters for cross-lingual transfer, and
(4) establishing the first standardized trilingual evaluation suite by
translating German benchmarks into Bavarian. Evaluations show that
Llama-GENBA-10B achieves strong cross-lingual performance, with the fine-tuned
variant surpassing Apertus-8B-2509 and gemma-2-9b in Bavarian and establishing
itself as the best model in its class for this language, while also
outperforming EuroLLM in English and matching its results in German. Training
on the Cerebras CS-2 demonstrated efficient large-scale multilingual
pretraining with documented energy use, offering a blueprint for inclusive
foundation models that integrate low-resource languages.

Motivation: 当前嵌入模型评测任务缺乏对数值细节理解能力的考察，而数值精确性在金融、医疗等领域致关重要

Method: 使用金融上下文的合成数据，对13个广泛使用的文本嵌入模型进行评估

Result: 模型普遍在准确捕捉数值细节方面表现较差，存在显著的数字理解能力缺陷

Conclusion: 现有嵌入模型在数值处理能力方面需要提升，研究结果为改进NLP系统的数字理解能力提供了重要见解

Abstract: Text embedding models are widely used in natural language processing
applications. However, their capability is often benchmarked on tasks that do
not require understanding nuanced numerical information in text. As a result,
it remains unclear whether current embedding models can precisely encode
numerical content, such as numbers, into embeddings. This question is critical
because embedding models are increasingly applied in domains where numbers
matter, such as finance and healthcare. For example, Company X's market share
grew by 2\% should be interpreted very differently from Company X's market
share grew by 20\%, even though both indicate growth in market share. This
study aims to examine whether text embedding models can capture such nuances.
Using synthetic data in a financial context, we evaluate 13 widely used text
embedding models and find that they generally struggle to capture numerical
details accurately. Our further analyses provide deeper insights into embedding
numeracy, informing future research to strengthen embedding model-based NLP
systems with improved capacity for handling numerical content.

Motivation: 证明法尔语作为"中等资源语言"标签的偏差，揭示在主观性NLP任务中真实的数据挑战

Method: 综述110篇相关研究成果，分析三个主观性任务（情感分析、情绪分析、毒性检测）的数据可用性和质量

Result: 发现公开数据集缺乏，现有数据集缺少人口统计因素，预测模型在不同数据集和模型间表现极不稳定

Conclusion: 纯粹的数据量增长不能有效改善语言在NLP领域的前景，数据质量、多样性和稳定性更为关键

Abstract: Given Farsi's speaker base of over 127 million people and the growing
availability of digital text, including more than 1.3 million articles on
Wikipedia, it is considered a middle-resource language. However, this label
quickly crumbles when the situation is examined more closely. We focus on three
subjective tasks (Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Analysis, and Toxicity Detection)
and find significant challenges in data availability and quality, despite the
overall increase in data availability. We review 110 publications on subjective
tasks in Farsi and observe a lack of publicly available datasets. Furthermore,
existing datasets often lack essential demographic factors, such as age and
gender, that are crucial for accurately modeling subjectivity in language. When
evaluating prediction models using the few available datasets, the results are
highly unstable across both datasets and models. Our findings indicate that the
volume of data is insufficient to significantly improve a language's prospects
in NLP.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了量子计算在自然语言处理中的强大潜力，为应用QNLP解决实际语言挑战开启了新途径

Abstract: Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
encoding and understanding the complexity of natural languages through the
power of quantum computation. This paper presents a pretrained quantum
context-sensitive embedding model, called QCSE, that captures context-sensitive
word embeddings, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems to learn
contextual relationships in languages. The model introduces quantum-native
context learning, enabling the utilization of quantum computers for linguistic
tasks. Central to the proposed approach are innovative context matrix
computation methods, designed to create unique, representations of words based
on their surrounding linguistic context. Five distinct methods are proposed and
tested for computing the context matrices, incorporating techniques such as
exponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, and hash-based
transformations. These methods ensure that the quantum embeddings retain
context sensitivity, thereby making them suitable for downstream language tasks
where the expressibility and properties of quantum systems are valuable
resources. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the associated
context matrix methods, evaluations are conducted on both a Fulani corpus, a
low-resource African language, dataset of small size and an English corpus of
slightly larger size. The results demonstrate that QCSE not only captures
context sensitivity but also leverages the expressibility of quantum systems
for representing rich, context-aware language information. The use of Fulani
further highlights the potential of QNLP to mitigate the problem of lack of
data for this category of languages. This work underscores the power of quantum
computation in natural language processing (NLP) and opens new avenues for
applying QNLP to real-world linguistic challenges across various tasks and
domains.

Motivation: 开发一个能够在语音到语音翻译中保持说话人身份的多语言TTS模型，解决跨语言语音合成中的说话人身份保持问题。

Method: 使用12层仅解码器Transformer，采用三阶段训练：1）文本到音频映射预训练；2）零样本语音克隆的监督微调；3）基于WER和说话人相似度指标的DPO对齐。

Result: LatinX在DPO训练后持续降低词错误率(WER)并提高客观相似度。人工评估显示其感知说话人相似度优于强基线XTTSv2，但揭示了客观与主观测量之间的差距。

Conclusion: LatinX在多语言语音合成中有效保持说话人身份，未来工作需要平衡偏好信号和开发低延迟架构。

Abstract: We present LatinX, a multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) model for cascaded
speech-to-speech translation that preserves the source speaker's identity
across languages. LatinX is a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in
three stages: (i) pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, (ii) supervised
fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and (iii) alignment with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) using automatically labeled pairs based on Word
Error Rate (WER) and speaker-similarity metrics. Trained on English and Romance
languages with emphasis on Portuguese, LatinX with DPO consistently reduces WER
and improves objective similarity over the fine-tuned baseline. Human
evaluations further indicate stronger perceived speaker similarity than a
strong baseline (XTTSv2), revealing gaps between objective and subjective
measures. We provide cross-lingual analyses and discuss balanced preference
signals and lower-latency architectures as future work.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了中医方剂分析中的信息不完整问题，通过结合GraphRAG和微调技术提升了模型性能，并开源了模型。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas play a significant role in
treating epidemics and complex diseases. Existing models for TCM utilize
traditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula
relationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula
compositions and detailed explanations. Although recent efforts have used TCM
instruction datasets to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable
formula generation, existing datasets lack sufficient details, such as the
roles of the formula's sovereign, minister, assistant, courier; efficacy;
contraindications; tongue and pulse diagnosis-limiting the depth of model
outputs. To address these challenges, we propose ZhiFangDanTai, a framework
combining Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with LLM
fine-tuning. ZhiFangDanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured
TCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced
instruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved
information. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating
that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization
error and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task. Experimental results on
both collected and clinical datasets demonstrate that ZhiFangDanTai achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. Our model is

Abstract: Evaluating factual accuracy in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated clinical
text is a critical barrier to adoption, as expert review is unscalable for the
continuous quality assurance these systems require. We address this challenge
with two complementary contributions. First, we introduce MedFactEval, a
framework for scalable, fact-grounded evaluation where clinicians define
high-salience key facts and an "LLM Jury"--a multi-LLM majority vote--assesses
their inclusion in generated summaries. Second, we present MedAgentBrief, a
model-agnostic, multi-step workflow designed to generate high-quality, factual
discharge summaries. To validate our evaluation framework, we established a
gold-standard reference using a seven-physician majority vote on
clinician-defined key facts from inpatient cases. The MedFactEval LLM Jury
achieved almost perfect agreement with this panel (Cohen's kappa=81%), a
performance statistically non-inferior to that of a single human expert
(kappa=67%, P < 0.001). Our work provides both a robust evaluation framework
(MedFactEval) and a high-performing generation workflow (MedAgentBrief),
offering a comprehensive approach to advance the responsible deployment of
generative AI in clinical workflows.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into diverse workflows, they are
increasingly being considered "collaborators" with humans. If such AI
collaborators are to be reliable, their behavior over multiturn interactions
must be predictable, validated and verified before deployment. Common alignment
techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and do
not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multiparty interactions. This
paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness
as partners in multiturn, multiparty collaborations. We study this question
through the lens of friction agents that intervene in group dialogues to
encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning
for deliberative decision-making. Using a roleplay methodology, we evaluate
interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task
conversations. We propose a novel counterfactual evaluation framework that
quantifies how friction interventions change the trajectory of group
collaboration and belief alignment. Our results show that a friction-aware
approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both
convergence to a common ground, or agreed-upon task-relevant propositions, and
correctness of task outcomes.

Method: 提出PSC-Joint方法，通过列表级、短语级和标记级三级语义相关性聚合模型，统计分析最相关偏置信息，并使用分组竞争筛选机制清除无关短语

Result: 在AISHELL-1和KeSpeech数据集上，相比基线模型平均F1分数提升21.34%和28.46%，适应不同长度偏置列表

Conclusion: PSC-Joint通过精准抓取多级语义相关性最相关偏置信息，有效提升了上下文ASR模型的性能和适应性

Abstract: Recently, cross-attention-based contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR)
models have made notable advancements in recognizing personalized biasing
phrases. However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by
variations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the
biasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of
the biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant
to a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and
integrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire
biasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information
volume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic
correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and
calculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate
representations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,
phrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled
to produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information
across various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual
recognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the
joint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification
mechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant
biasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves
average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46%
on KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths.

Conclusion: 通过算法与架构的协同设计，成功解决了动态计算在批量推理中的系统瓶颈问题，为大语言模型的高效部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their
practical deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. While
adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs,
they introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save
computation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically
reduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this
conflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike
an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first
addresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by
proposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep
parameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields
compact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical
synchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents
a unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically
assign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a
new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively
optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a
single model.

Motivation: 大型语言模型容易产生幻觉问题，但现有的真实性基准（如TruthfulQA）主要针对英语，缺乏对低资源语言的评估，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 将TruthfulQA基准翻译成菲律宾语（KatotohananQA），使用二元选择框架评估7个免费专有模型，比较英语和菲律宾语版本的表现。

Result: 发现英语和菲律宾语真实性存在显著性能差距，新版OpenAI模型（GPT-5和GPT-5 mini）展现出强大的多语言鲁棒性，但不同问题类型、类别和主题的迁移效果存在差异。

Conclusion: 需要更广泛的多语言评估来确保LLM使用的公平性和可靠性，某些问题类型在跨语言迁移时鲁棒性较差。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various
tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliable adoption.
Benchmarks such as TruthfulQA have been developed to measure truthfulness, yet
they are primarily available in English, leaving a gap in evaluating LLMs in
low-resource languages. To address this, we present KatotohananQA, a Filipino
translation of the TruthfulQA benchmark. Seven free-tier proprietary models
were assessed using a binary-choice framework. Findings show a significant
performance gap between English and Filipino truthfulness, with newer OpenAI
models (GPT-5 and GPT-5 mini) demonstrating strong multilingual robustness.
Results also reveal disparities across question characteristics, suggesting
that some question types, categories, and topics are less robust to
multilingual transfer which highlight the need for broader multilingual
evaluation to ensure fairness and reliability in LLM usage.

*Zhenqi Jia,Rui Liu,Berrak Sisman,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MFCIG-CSS是一个基于多模态细粒度上下文交互图的对话语音合成系统，通过构建语义和韵律两个细粒度交互图来提升对话语音的自然韵律表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注话语级别的交互特征建模，忽视了多模态对话历史中词级别的细粒度语义和韵律知识交互，导致对话语音韵律表达不够自然。

Method: 构建两个专门的多模态细粒度对话交互图（语义交互图和韵律交互图），编码词级别语义、韵律及其对后续话语影响的交互特征，利用这些特征增强合成语音的对话韵律。

Result: 在DailyTalk数据集上的实验表明，MFCIG-CSS在韵律表达性方面优于所有基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的细粒度交互图方法能够有效捕捉对话中的语义和韵律交互，显著提升对话语音合成的自然度和表现力。

Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to generate speech with natural
prosody by understanding the multimodal dialogue history (MDH). The latest work
predicts the accurate prosody expression of the target utterance by modeling
the utterance-level interaction characteristics of MDH and the target
utterance. However, MDH contains fine-grained semantic and prosody knowledge at
the word level. Existing methods overlook the fine-grained semantic and
prosodic interaction modeling. To address this gap, we propose MFCIG-CSS, a
novel Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph-based CSS system. Our
approach constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue
interaction graphs: a semantic interaction graph and a prosody interaction
graph. These two interaction graphs effectively encode interactions between
word-level semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in
MDH. The encoded interaction features are then leveraged to enhance synthesized
speech with natural conversational prosody. Experiments on the DailyTalk
dataset demonstrate that MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in terms of
prosodic expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at
https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/MFCIG-CSS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OLieRA是一种新的LLM微调方法，通过引入李群理论和乘法更新来保持参数几何结构，同时在任务子空间应用正交约束，解决了顺序多任务学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数正则化方法如O-LoRA和N-LoRA虽然通过强制低秩子空间正交性来减轻任务干扰，但忽略了传统加法微调会破坏LLM参数的内在几何结构，限制了性能表现。

Method: 提出OLieRA方法，将李群理论引入LLM微调：利用乘法更新来保持参数几何结构，同时对任务子空间应用正交性约束。

Result: 实验表明OLieRA在标准持续学习基准上达到了最先进的结果，在大量任务设置中保持顶级性能。

Conclusion: 保持LLM参数空间的几何结构对于缓解灾难性遗忘至关重要，OLieRA通过结合李群理论和正交约束有效解决了这一问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to catastrophic forgetting in
sequential multi-task settings. Parameter regularization methods such as O-LoRA
and N-LoRA alleviate task interference by enforcing low-rank subspace
orthogonality, but they overlook the fact that conventional additive
fine-tuning disrupts the intrinsic geometric structure of LLM parameters,
limiting performance. Our key insight is that the parameter space of LLMs
possesses a geometric structure, which must be preserved in addition to
enforcing orthogonality. Based on this, we propose Orthogonal Low-rank
Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA), which introduces Lie group theory into LLM
fine-tuning: leveraging multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry
while applying orthogonality constraints to task subspaces. Experiments
demonstrate that OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the Standard CL
benchmark and remains among the top-performing methods in the Large Number of
Tasks setting.

TL;DR: EuroParlVote是一个用于评估LLM在政治敏感语境中的新基准，基于欧洲议会辩论和投票数据，揭示了LLM在性别分类和投票预测任务中的系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建EuroParlVote基准是为了评估大语言模型在政治敏感语境中的表现，特别是在涉及性别、政治立场等敏感属性时的偏见问题。

Method: 通过链接欧洲议会辩论演讲和投票结果，结合议员的人口统计元数据（性别、年龄、国家、政治团体），评估LLM在性别分类和投票预测两个任务上的表现。

Result: 发现LLM经常将女性议员误分类为男性，在模拟女性演讲者投票时准确率降低；政治倾向上偏向中间派，在极左和极右团体上表现较差；GPT-4o等专有模型在鲁棒性和公平性上优于开源模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在政治语境中的系统性偏见，发布了EuroParlVote数据集、代码和演示以支持未来NLP公平性和问责制研究。

Abstract: We introduce EuroParlVote, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) in politically sensitive contexts. It links European Parliament
debate speeches to roll-call vote outcomes and includes rich demographic
metadata for each Member of the European Parliament (MEP), such as gender, age,
country, and political group. Using EuroParlVote, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLMs on two tasks -- gender classification and vote prediction -- revealing
consistent patterns of bias. We find that LLMs frequently misclassify female
MEPs as male and demonstrate reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female
speakers. Politically, LLMs tend to favor centrist groups while underperforming
on both far-left and far-right ones. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform
open-weight alternatives in terms of both robustness and fairness. We release
the EuroParlVote dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness
and accountability in NLP within political contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究公开了首个合成文本嵌入数据集，发现合成数据对模型泛化的提升有限且具有任务特异性，挑战了合成数据能构建更鲁棒通用嵌入模型的传统认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用文本嵌入模型的发展依赖于合成LLM生成数据，但缺乏公开可用的合成数据集阻碍了对其泛化作用的研究。

Method: 首先复现并公开了Wang等人提出的合成数据（Mistral-E5），然后系统分析了合成数据在哪些具体方面提升模型泛化能力。

Result: 合成数据质量高且能带来性能提升，但收益稀疏且高度局限于特定数据集，不同任务间存在性能权衡，一个任务的提升可能导致另一个任务性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前合成数据方法在构建通用嵌入模型方面存在局限性，合成数据训练并不总能带来跨任务的更鲁棒嵌入模型。

Abstract: Recent progress in developing general purpose text embedders has been driven
by training on ever-growing corpora of synthetic LLM-generated data.
Nonetheless, no publicly available synthetic dataset exists, posing a barrier
to studying its role for generalization. To address this issue, we first
reproduce and publicly release the synthetic data proposed by Wang et al.
(Mistral-E5). Our synthetic data is high quality and leads to consistent
improvements in performance. Next, we critically examine where exactly
synthetic data improves model generalization. Our analysis reveals that
benefits from synthetic data are sparse and highly localized to individual
datasets. Moreover, we observe trade-offs between the performance on different
categories and data that benefits one task, degrades performance on another.
Our findings highlight the limitations of current synthetic data approaches for
building general-purpose embedders and challenge the notion that training on
synthetic data leads to more robust embedding models across tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to recruitment automation. Large
Language Models (LLMs) were fine-tuned to improve accuracy and efficiency.
Building upon our previous work on the Multilayer Large Language Model-Based
Robotic Process Automation Applicant Tracking (MLAR) system . This work
introduces a novel methodology. Training fine-tuned LLMs specifically tuned for
recruitment tasks. The proposed framework addresses the limitations of generic
LLMs by creating a synthetic dataset that uses a standardized JSON format. This
helps ensure consistency and scalability. In addition to the synthetic data
set, the resumes were parsed using DeepSeek, a high-parameter LLM. The resumes
were parsed into the same structured JSON format and placed in the training
set. This will help improve data diversity and realism. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance
metrics, such as exact match, F1 score, BLEU score, ROUGE score, and overall
similarity compared to base models and other state-of-the-art LLMs. In
particular, the fine-tuned Phi-4 model achieved the highest F1 score of 90.62%,
indicating exceptional precision and recall in recruitment tasks. This study
highlights the potential of fine-tuned LLMs. Furthermore, it will revolutionize
recruitment workflows by providing more accurate candidate-job matching.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mask-GCG是一种针对大语言模型越狱攻击的改进方法，通过可学习的token掩码识别后缀中高影响力token，修剪低影响力token来减少冗余和计算开销，同时保持攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GCG越狱攻击方法使用固定长度的后缀，但其中可能存在token冗余问题未被探索，需要开发更高效的方法来减少计算开销并提高攻击效率。

Method: 提出Mask-GCG方法，使用可学习的token掩码来识别后缀中有影响力的token位置，增加高影响力位置的更新概率，修剪低影响力位置的token，从而减少梯度空间大小和计算开销。

Result: 实验结果显示，后缀中大部分token对攻击成功有重要贡献，修剪少量低影响力token不会影响损失值或攻击成功率，揭示了LLM提示中的token冗余现象。

Conclusion: Mask-GCG方法有效减少了越狱攻击的计算开销和时间，同时保持攻击效果，为从越狱攻击角度开发高效和可解释的LLM提供了见解。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various
successful methods whereby attackers manipulate models into generating harmful
responses that they are designed to avoid. Among these, Greedy Coordinate
Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes
the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several
improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length
suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains
unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that
employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix.
Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact
positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only
reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby
lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve
successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the
original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most
tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a
minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the
attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts.
Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs
from the perspective of jailbreak attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法直接将检索文档注入模型上下文，受限于有限的上下文窗口，引入额外计算开销，且现有基准缺乏专家标注，无法反映模型在真实法律场景中的能力。

Method: 提出PL-CA方法，采用参数化RAG框架对语料知识进行数据增强，将法律知识编码为参数向量，通过LoRA集成到LLM的前馈网络中。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在减少长上下文开销的同时，在下游任务上保持了与传统RAG相当的竞争性能。

Conclusion: PL-CA方法有效缓解了模型上下文压力，提高了法律领域知识检索和应用的效率，同时提供了高质量的专家标注数据集。

Abstract: Conventional RAG is considered one of the most effective methods for
addressing model knowledge insufficiency and hallucination, particularly in the
judicial domain that requires high levels of knowledge rigor, logical
consistency, and content integrity. However, the conventional RAG method only
injects retrieved documents directly into the model's context, which severely
constrains models due to their limited context windows and introduces
additional computational overhead through excessively long contexts, thereby
disrupting models' attention and degrading performance on downstream tasks.
Moreover, many existing benchmarks lack expert annotation and focus solely on
individual downstream tasks while real-world legal scenarios consist of
multiple mixed legal tasks, indicating conventional benchmarks' inadequacy for
reflecting models' true capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose
PL-CA, which introduces a parametric RAG (P-RAG) framework to perform data
augmentation on corpus knowledge and encode this legal knowledge into
parametric vectors, and then integrates this parametric knowledge into the
LLM's feed-forward networks (FFN) via LoRA, thereby alleviating models' context
pressure. Additionally, we also construct a multi-task legal dataset comprising
more than 2000 training and test instances, which are all expert-annotated and
manually verified. We conduct our experiments on our dataset, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the overhead
associated with excessively long contexts while maintaining competitive
performance on downstream tasks compared to conventional RAG. Our code and
dataset are provided in the appendix.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在多语言常识生成方面的能力，填补现有研究在多语言特别是低资源语言常识生成评估方面的空白。

Method: 构建MULTICOM基准数据集（扩展自COCOTEROS），覆盖4种语言；评估多个开源LLMs；结合自动指标、LLM-as-a-judge方法和人工标注进行综合评估。

Result: 英语表现最佳，低资源语言（如瓦伦西亚语）表现显著较差；上下文支持对低资源语言有一定帮助但效果不一。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在多语言常识生成方面存在明显局限性，特别是在低资源语言上表现不佳，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: This paper explores the multilingual commonsense generation abilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate this investigation, we introduce
MULTICOM, a novel benchmark that extends the COCOTEROS dataset to four
languages: English, Spanish, Dutch, and Valencian. The task involves generating
a commonsensical sentence that includes a given triplet of words. We evaluate a
range of open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Qwen, Gemma, EuroLLM, and
Salamandra, on this benchmark. Our evaluation combines automatic metrics,
LLM-as-a-judge approaches (using Prometheus and JudgeLM), and human
annotations. Results consistently show superior performance in English, with
significantly lower performance in less-resourced languages. While contextual
support yields mixed results, it tends to benefit underrepresented languages.
These findings underscore the current limitations of LLMs in multilingual
commonsense generation. The dataset is publicly available at

Result: WebExplorer-8B在多样化信息搜索基准测试中达到同规模最先进性能，在BrowseComp-en/zh上准确率超过WebSailor-72B，在WebWalkerQA和FRAMES上达到100B参数以下模型最佳性能。模型平均能进行16轮搜索，并在HLE基准上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为长视野网络代理的发展提供了一条实用路径，证明了通过高质量数据生成和强化学习训练，较小规模的模型也能在复杂网络信息搜索任务中取得卓越性能。

Abstract: The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward
agentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for
retrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing
open-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities
on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify
that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information
seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic
data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative,
long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer
pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By
leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced
web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100
tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse
information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art
performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able
to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving
higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best
performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES.
Beyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong
generalization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on
knowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a
practical path toward long-horizon web agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种新的层间缩放变体（Framed、Reverse、Crown），通过在预训练阶段重新分配FFN宽度和注意力头，在固定参数预算下实现了比各向同性基线更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Transformer语言模型使用统一的层大小，忽略了不同深度可能扮演的多样化功能角色及其计算容量需求。

Method: 基于层间缩放（LWS）和剪枝文献，引入了三种新的LWS变体，通过两或三点线性插值在预训练阶段重新分配FFN宽度和注意力头。

Result: 在180M参数预算和5B tokens训练下，所有模型都收敛到相似的损失，相比等成本各向同性基线获得了更好的性能，且训练吞吐量没有显著下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了预训练层间架构设计空间的初步探索，但未来工作需要扩展到更多tokens和参数规模以充分评估其潜力。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models traditionally use uniform (isotropic) layer
sizes, yet they ignore the diverse functional roles that different depths can
play and their computational capacity needs. Building on Layer-Wise Scaling
(LWS) and pruning literature, we introduce three new LWS variants - Framed,
Reverse, and Crown - that redistribute FFN widths and attention heads via two
or three-point linear interpolation in the pre-training stage. We present the
first systematic ablation of LWS and its variants, on a fixed budget of 180M
parameters, trained on 5B tokens. All models converge to similar losses and
achieve better performance compared to an equal-cost isotropic baseline,
without a substantial decrease in training throughput. This work represents an
initial step into the design space of layer-wise architectures for
pre-training, but future work should scale experiments to orders of magnitude
more tokens and parameters to fully assess their potential.

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains often faces a
critical bottleneck: the scarcity of high-quality, human-curated data. While
large volumes of unchecked data are readily available, indiscriminately using
them for fine-tuning risks introducing noise and degrading performance.
Strategic data selection is thus crucial, requiring a method that is both
accurate and efficient. Existing approaches, categorized as similarity-based
and direct optimization methods, struggle to simultaneously achieve these
goals. In this paper, we introduce LAMDAS (LLM As an iMplicit classifier for
domain-specific DAta Selection), a novel approach that leverages the
pre-trained LLM itself as an implicit classifier, thereby bypassing explicit
feature engineering and computationally intensive optimization process. LAMDAS
reframes data selection as a one-class classification problem, identifying
candidate data that "belongs" to the target domain defined by a small reference
dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LAMDAS not only
exceeds the performance of full-data training using a fraction of the data but
also outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines under various
scenarios. Furthermore, LAMDAS achieves the most compelling balance between
performance gains and computational efficiency compared to all evaluated
baselines.

*Mengxue Yang,Chun Yang,Jiaqi Zhu,Jiafan Li,Jingqi Zhang,Yuyang Li,Ying Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLiNT是一个结构感知的语言模型框架，通过注入知识图谱结构信息和对比学习来解决链接预测中的结构稀疏性和语义模糊性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识图谱链接预测中虽然具有强大的生成推理能力，但对结构信号的利用有限，导致结构稀疏和语义模糊问题，特别是在不完全或零样本设置下

Method: 提出SLiNT框架：1) 结构引导邻域增强(SGNE)检索伪邻居丰富稀疏实体；2) 动态硬对比学习(DHCL)通过插值硬正负样本来解决实体级模糊性；3) 梯度解耦双注入(GDDI)在保持核心LLM参数的同时进行token级结构感知干预

Result: 在WN18RR和FB15k-237数据集上的实验表明，SLiNT相比基于嵌入和基于生成的基线方法取得了优越或竞争性的性能

Conclusion: 该方法证明了结构感知表示学习对于可扩展知识图谱补全的有效性

Abstract: Link prediction in knowledge graphs requires integrating structural
information and semantic context to infer missing entities. While large
language models offer strong generative reasoning capabilities, their limited
exploitation of structural signals often results in structural sparsity and
semantic ambiguity, especially under incomplete or zero-shot settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SLiNT (Structure-aware Language model with
Injection and coNtrastive Training), a modular framework that injects
knowledge-graph-derived structural context into a frozen LLM backbone with
lightweight LoRA-based adaptation for robust link prediction. Specifically,
Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) retrieves pseudo-neighbors to
enrich sparse entities and mitigate missing context; Dynamic Hard Contrastive
Learning (DHCL) introduces fine-grained supervision by interpolating hard
positives and negatives to resolve entity-level ambiguity; and
Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) performs token-level structure-aware
intervention while preserving the core LLM parameters. Experiments on WN18RR
and FB15k-237 show that SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance
compared with both embedding-based and generation-based baselines,
demonstrating the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for
scalable knowledge graph completion.

*Xin Tong,Zhi Lin,Jingya Wang,Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAVE是一个无需微调的参数自由解码框架，通过头部自适应门控和价值校准来解决LLM幻觉问题，在多个QA基准测试中有效减少幻觉并优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在检索增强生成长上下文生成中经常产生幻觉，即使相关证据存在。这源于两个问题：头部重要性被视为输入无关的，原始注意力权重不能很好地反映每个token的真实贡献

Method: HAVE框架包含头部自适应门控（实例级软重加权注意力头）和价值校准（通过价值向量大小增强注意力来近似写回贡献），通过轻量级不确定性缩放策略将token级证据与语言模型分布融合

Result: 在多个QA基准测试和不同LLM家族上的实验表明，HAVE持续减少幻觉并优于包括DAGCD在内的强基线方法，且开销适中

Conclusion: HAVE是一个透明、可复现的框架，无需微调即可与现成LLMs集成，在单次前向传播中运行，提高了实际应用中的可信生成能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinations in
retrieval-augmented or long-context generation, even when relevant evidence is
present. This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as
input-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true
contribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a
parameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE
introduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing
of attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the
magnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together,
these modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and
fuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled
policy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass,
making it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA
benchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces
hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest
overhead. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and readily integrates
with off-the-shelf LLMs, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world
settings.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications has
driven the need for structured and reliable responses. A key challenge in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is ensuring that outputs align
with expected formats while minimizing hallucinations. This study examines the
role of guided decoding in RAG systems, comparing three methods, Outlines,
XGrammar, and LM Format Enforcer, across different multi-turn prompting setups
(0-turn, 1-turn, and 2-turn). By evaluating success rates, hallucination rates,
and output quality, we provide insights into their performance and
applicability. Our findings reveal how multi-turn interactions influence guided
decoding, uncovering unexpected performance variations that can inform method
selection for specific use cases. This work advances the understanding of
structured output generation in RAG systems, offering both theoretical insights
and practical guidance for LLM deployment.

Motivation: 互文性是文学研究中的核心概念，但传统分析方法难以进行大规模量化研究。需要开发可扩展的量化模型来支持网络化分析。

Method: 使用文本嵌入技术，对两个文本的n-gram进行成对相似性比较，然后平均结果作为整体互文性得分。通过网络分析揭示中心性和社区结构。

Result: 在4个已知互文性程度的文本上验证有效，并在267个多样化文本上进行可扩展性测试，证明方法既有效又高效。网络分析成功捕捉到互文关系的中心性和社区模式。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了互文性的量化和网络化分析，为文学研究提供了可扩展的计算分析方法，能够有效揭示文本间的复杂互文关系。

Abstract: Intertextuality is a central tenet in literary studies. It refers to the
intricate links between literary texts that are created by various types of
references. This paper proposes a new quantitative model of intertextuality to
enable scalable analysis and network-based insights: perform pairwise
comparisons of the embeddings of n-grams from two texts and average their
results as the overall intertextuality. Validation on four texts with known
degrees of intertextuality, alongside a scalability test on 267 diverse texts,
demonstrates the method's effectiveness and efficiency. Network analysis
further reveals centrality and community structures, affirming the approach's
success in capturing and quantifying intertextual relationships.

TL;DR: MoLER是一个基于混合损失增强强化学习的领域感知RAG方法，通过两阶段训练优化检索性能，在基准数据集上达到最先进水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统的粗排序方法难以平衡领域知识学习和查询增强，导致检索性能不佳

Method: 两阶段管道：1）混合损失持续预训练平衡领域知识和通用能力；2）GRPO强化学习优化查询和段落生成；创新MSLF策略降低计算开销

Result: 在基准数据集上显著优于基线方法，实现最先进性能

Conclusion: MoLER填补了RAG系统的知识鸿沟，能够在专业领域实现鲁棒且可扩展的检索

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on the retrieval
stage, particularly the coarse-ranking process. Existing coarse-ranking
optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge
learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance.
To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that
uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a
two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of
Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language
capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for
maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage
Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL
training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage
Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline
methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and
scalable retrieval in specialized domains.

TL;DR: IntrEx数据集首次对教师-学生互动中的趣味性和预期趣味性进行大规模标注，研究发现经过微调的小型LLM在预测趣味性方面优于大型专有模型，并分析了语言和认知因素对教育对话参与度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 第二语言习得中参与度和动机至关重要，但维持学习者在教育对话中的兴趣仍具挑战性。现有研究主要关注教育文本的趣味性，而对对话中驱动参与度的语言特征了解甚少。

Method: 基于教师-学生聊天室语料库(TSCC)构建IntrEx数据集，采用序列级标注和基于比较的评分方法，使用100多名二语学习者进行严格标注，并研究LLM预测人类趣味性判断的能力。

Result: 经过趣味性评分微调的LLM(7B/8B参数)在预测趣味性方面优于GPT-4o等大型专有模型，表明专门数据集在教育场景参与度建模方面的潜力。分析了具体性、可理解性和接受度等语言认知因素对参与度的影响。

Conclusion: IntrEx数据集填补了教育对话趣味性研究的空白，证明了专门数据集和微调模型在教育参与度建模中的有效性，为理解对话中兴趣演变的语言驱动因素提供了新见解。

Abstract: Engagement and motivation are crucial for second-language acquisition, yet
maintaining learner interest in educational conversations remains a challenge.
While prior research has explored what makes educational texts interesting,
still little is known about the linguistic features that drive engagement in
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce IntrEx, the first large
dataset annotated for interestingness and expected interestingness in
teacher-student interactions. Built upon the Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus
(TSCC), IntrEx extends prior work by incorporating sequence-level annotations,
allowing for the study of engagement beyond isolated turns to capture how
interest evolves over extended dialogues. We employ a rigorous annotation
process with over 100 second-language learners, using a comparison-based rating
approach inspired by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
improve agreement. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can
predict human interestingness judgments. We find that LLMs (7B/8B parameters)
fine-tuned on interestingness ratings outperform larger proprietary models like
GPT-4o, demonstrating the potential for specialised datasets to model
engagement in educational settings. Finally, we analyze how linguistic and
cognitive factors, such as concreteness, comprehensibility (readability), and
uptake, influence engagement in educational dialogues.

Method: 评估两种主要方法：通过价值预测推断主观性 vs 直接识别主观性，对比对比损失与二元交叉碑损失的组合效果

Result: 直接主观性识别方法显著提升了标记主观论证的模型性能，而对比损失组合并未提升性能但减少了对每个标签主观性的依赖性

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够帮助识别个体可能有不同解释的论证，促进更细致的标注过程

Abstract: Aggregating multiple annotations into a single ground truth label may hide
valuable insights into annotator disagreement, particularly in tasks where
subjectivity plays a crucial role. In this work, we explore methods for
identifying subjectivity in recognizing the human values that motivate
arguments. We evaluate two main approaches: inferring subjectivity through
value prediction vs. directly identifying subjectivity. Our experiments show
that direct subjectivity identification significantly improves the model
performance of flagging subjective arguments. Furthermore, combining
contrastive loss with binary cross-entropy loss does not improve performance
but reduces the dependency on per-label subjectivity. Our proposed methods can
help identify arguments that individuals may interpret differently, fostering a
more nuanced annotation process.

TL;DR: IFT训练会损害LLM的安全拒绝能力，研究发现拒绝方向(r-direction)在训练中会漂移。ProCon方法通过投影约束损失来缓解这种漂移，结合预热策略和数据增强，能显著降低安全风险同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令微调(IFT)虽然能提升大语言模型的各种能力，但会显著损害模型的安全性，特别是拒绝恶意指令的能力。研究发现隐藏状态中的拒绝方向(r-direction)在训练过程中会发生漂移，这是导致安全风险的原因之一。

Method: 提出ProCon方法：1) 使用投影约束损失项，正则化训练样本隐藏状态在r-direction上的投影幅度；2) 引入预热策略，在训练早期施加强约束；3) 拓宽数据分布以增强约束信号。

Result: 在各种数据集、场景和LLM上的实验表明，该方法能显著降低IFT带来的安全风险，同时保持任务性能增益。与强基线相比，始终提供更优的整体性能。

Conclusion: ProCon方法有助于在训练过程中稳定r-direction，这种基于可解释性的LLM内部机制探索为未来的安全研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective
post-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise
LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,
raising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of
LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,
which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this
insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,
which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To
mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a
projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of
each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis
shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the
refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by
overall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our
observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we
introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and
broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an
enhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios,
and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks
posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong
baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.
Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the
r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration
of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety
research.

TL;DR: MachineLearningLM是一个持续预训练框架，通过合成大量结构因果模型任务来增强通用LLM的上下文机器学习能力，在少样本到1024样本的范围内都表现出色，同时保持通用知识推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具有广泛的世界知识和推理能力，但在标准机器学习任务中难以通过纯上下文学习从大量样本中有效学习，需要提升其上下文机器学习能力。

Method: 使用随机森林教师模型，将基于树的决策策略蒸馏到LLM中，通过数百万个结构因果模型合成ML任务进行持续预训练，采用token高效的提示序列化方法。

Result: 在Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct基础上，平均比GPT-5-mini等强基线模型在跨领域表格分类任务上提升约15%，展现出从8到1024样本的单调递增扩展规律，达到随机森林级别的准确率。

Conclusion: MachineLearningLM框架成功为通用LLM赋予了强大的上下文ML能力，同时保持了75.4%的MMLU分数，证明可以在不牺牲通用能力的情况下专门增强ML性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong
general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many
in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to
leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without
gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable
continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust
in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning
for broader chat workflows.
  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural
causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a
random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM
to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a
token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and
delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.
  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8),
MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an
average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across
finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking
many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context
demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it
attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat
capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves
75.4% on MMLU.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在安全性和实用性之间的权衡问题，传统方法往往导致保守的拒绝响应，影响实际可用性。需要推进安全性和可用性的帕累托前沿。

Method: 提出MoGU_v2框架，在编码高可分类安全特征的层中嵌入路由器，通过双向适配机制实现路由器与隐藏状态的紧密耦合，使用数据混合策略恢复安全性。

Result: MoGU_v2在各种LLM系列（主流LLM、设备端LLM、推理LLM）中表现出强大的适应性和稳定改进，能够轻松恢复Instruction Fine-tuning带来的安全风险。

Conclusion: MoGU_v2是一个强大且多功能的解决方案，能够有效缓解现实应用中的安全风险，在安全性和可用性之间实现更好的平衡。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly permeate human life, their
security has emerged as a critical concern, particularly their ability to
maintain harmless responses to malicious instructions. Although extensive
methods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,
rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents
a key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and
security, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we
propose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically
allocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions
of security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial
potential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy
and performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved
MoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and
hidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly
classifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during
router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong
adaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including
mainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs
optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for
user interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction
Fine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task
performance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive
improvements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for
mitigating security risks in real-world applications.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data is a critical bottleneck
for advancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
work confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving
research into a scalable data engine. Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs
or complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework
leverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to
derive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is
principled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for "interesting" theorems, and
generate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by
construction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three
difficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection,
and proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a
clear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural
reasoning. Our framework provides both the diagnostic tool to measure this gap
and a scalable source of symbolic training data to address it. We make the code
and data publicly available.

Conclusion: 由于没有模型能够达到完美准确性且检验性差异很大，最有效和负责任的近期应用是人在循环系统，让大语言模型作为强大助手加速和标准化数据标签过程，从而提高运维数据质量和下游可靠性分析。

Abstract: Effective Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is critical to reducing the
Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) from wind power, yet the unstructured,
free-text nature of turbine maintenance logs presents a significant barrier to
automated analysis. Our paper addresses this by presenting a novel and
reproducible framework for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on the
task of classifying these complex industrial records. To promote transparency
and encourage further research, this framework has been made publicly available
as an open-source tool. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of
state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational
assessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and
model calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy,
identifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard
and trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that
classification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic
ambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component
identification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model
achieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude
that the most effective and responsible near-term application is a
Human-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate
and standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&M data
quality and downstream reliability analysis.

Result: 在Qwen、LLaMA和Gemma系列模型(0.5B-70B)上实验显示，在相似或更高剪枝比例下达到最先进的下游任务性能，参数、GPU内存和端到端延迟显著减少。

Conclusion: COMPACT结合了深度和宽度剪枝的优点，具有部署友好性、规模适应性、训练自由操作和强大的内存节省及吞吐量增益，是高效的LLM压缩方法。

Abstract: Making LLMs more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial
for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at
scale. Pruning is a key technique toward this goal. However, prior pruning
methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout
or requires custom inference code, while depth pruning removes entire layers
and can cause abrupt accuracy drops. In this work, we propose COMPACT, which
jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii)
prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations,
aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys
merits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps
a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN
pruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong
memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and
Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at
similar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters,
GPU memory, and end-to-end latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然表现优异，但确保其可信质性仍是重要挑战，需要给合各国文化价值观的评估标准

Method: 开发EPT评测指标，涵盖真实性、安全性、公平性、稳健性、隐私性和道德对齐六个维度，并通过自动化和人工评估测试ChatGPT、Claude等多个领先模型

Result: 发现模型在安全性维度存在显著缺陷，为可靠人工智能发展提供了重要见解

Conclusion: 研究突出了模型安全性的紧急需求，为发展可信质、符合文化价值观的AI系统指明了方向

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets using advanced
deep learning architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of language tasks, becoming a cornerstone of modern AI technologies.
However, ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge, as
reliability is essential not only for accurate performance but also for
upholding ethical, cultural, and social values. Careful alignment of training
data and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing
responsible AI systems. In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of
Persian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically
designed to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects:
truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. We
curated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading
models - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and
Qwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments. Our results reveal
significant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need
for focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior. Furthermore,
our findings offer valuable insights into the alignment of these models with
Persian ethical-cultural values and highlight critical gaps and opportunities
for advancing trustworthy and culturally responsible AI. The dataset is
publicly available at: https://github.com/Rezamirbagheri110/EPT-Benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出了AggLM方法，通过强化学习训练聚合模型来整合多个候选解决方案，相比简单投票或奖励模型排序能更有效地提升大语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时计算扩展方法主要依赖简单多数投票或奖励模型排序来聚合解决方案，但这些方法可能只能带来有限的性能提升。需要学习更智能的聚合技能来充分利用多个候选解决方案。

Method: 使用强化学习训练聚合模型，让模型学习审查、协调和合成最终正确答案。关键是通过平衡简单和困难训练样本，使模型既能恢复少数但正确的答案，也能处理简单多数正确的答案。

Result: AggLM方法在多个基准测试中优于基于规则的基线和奖励模型基线，能够有效泛化到不同模型的解决方案，包括比训练数据中更强的模型，同时比多数投票方法需要更少的token。

Conclusion: 将聚合作为显式推理技能进行学习是有效的，通过精心设计的强化学习训练，聚合模型能够显著提升大语言模型在推理任务上的性能，同时提高计算效率。

Abstract: Scaling up test-time compute, by generating multiple independent solutions
and selecting or aggregating among them, has become a central paradigm for
improving large language models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. While
most prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to
aggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this
work, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a
set of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile,
and synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard
training examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover
minority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers.
Empirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and
reward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes
effectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than
contained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens
than majority voting with larger numbers of solutions.

Motivation: 当前缺乏针对编码器模型特别是多语言模型的最新研究，需要开发一个能够处理多种语言的高性能编码器模型

Method: 引入逆掩码比率调度和逆温度采样比率等新技术，在衰减阶段添加1700多种低资源语言数据来大幅提升性能

Result: mmBERT在分类和检索任务上显著优于前代模型，在高低资源语言上都表现出色，性能与OpenAI o3和Google Gemini 2.5 Pro相当

Conclusion: 通过创新的训练策略和数据调度方法，mmBERT证明了编码器模型在多语言处理方面的巨大潜力，特别是在低资源语言上的优异表现

Abstract: Encoder-only languages models are frequently used for a variety of standard
machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there
has been a lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect
to multilingual models. We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model
pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build
mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio
schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700
low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing
that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the
relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these
low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar
classification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5
Pro. Overall, we show that mmBERT significantly outperforms the previous
generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks -- on both high and
low-resource languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双层优化方法，通过让监督微调(SFT)基于最优RL策略进行元学习，实现SFT和强化学习的协同训练，在五个推理基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的两阶段方法（先SFT后RL）限制了SFT和RL之间的交互，限制了整体效果。RL虽然能激励大语言模型的推理能力，但由于试错性质导致效率低下。

Method: 使用双层优化方法：下层执行RL更新并同时接收SFT监督，上层显式最大化协作增益（联合SFT-RL训练相对于单独RL的性能优势）。SFT目标基于最优RL策略，使SFT能够元学习如何指导RL的优化过程。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试上的实证评估表明，该方法始终优于基线方法，并在有效性和效率之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的双层优化方法通过促进SFT和RL训练范式之间的更好协作，显著提高了推理模型的学习效果和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe
efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common
practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this
decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby
constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for
learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate
better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT
objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how
to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs
RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level
explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint
SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and
achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有的扩散语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现不如自回归模型，需要一种能够整合偏好推理轨迹的后训练方法来提升性能。

Method: 提出TraceRL框架，使用扩散价值模型增强训练稳定性，支持不同架构的扩散语言模型，并采用课程学习策略。

Result: TraDo-4B-Instruct在数学推理任务上超越7B规模的自回归模型；TraDo-8B-Instruct在数学推理基准上相对Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct提升6.1%，相对Llama3.1-8B-Instruct提升51.3%；首个长链推理DLM在MATH500上相对Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct提升18.1%。

Conclusion: TraceRL框架有效提升了扩散语言模型的推理能力，推出的TraDo系列模型在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并开源了完整的训练部署框架。

Abstract: We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for
diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference
trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different
architectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances
training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex
math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific
models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing
TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models,
namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still
consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks.
TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first
long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1%
relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical
applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building,
training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The
framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for
both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of
various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and
general tasks. Code and Models: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/dLLM-RL

Abstract: Language use is shaped by pragmatics -- i.e., reasoning about communicative
goals and norms in context. As language models (LMs) are increasingly used as
conversational agents, it becomes ever more important to understand their
pragmatic reasoning abilities. We propose an evaluation framework derived from
Wavelength, a popular communication game where a speaker and a listener
communicate about a broad range of concepts in a granular manner. We study a
range of LMs on both language comprehension and language production using
direct and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and further explore a Rational
Speech Act (RSA) approach to incorporating Bayesian pragmatic reasoning into LM
inference. We find that state-of-the-art LMs, but not smaller ones, achieve
strong performance on language comprehension, obtaining similar-to-human
accuracy and exhibiting high correlations with human judgments even without CoT
prompting or RSA. On language production, CoT can outperform direct prompting,
and using RSA provides significant improvements over both approaches. Our study
helps identify the strengths and limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning
abilities and demonstrates the potential for improving them with RSA, opening
up future avenues for understanding conceptual representation, language
understanding, and social reasoning in LMs and humans.

TL;DR: Label Smoothing++是一种改进的标签正则化方法，通过为非目标类别分配非零概率并考虑类间关系，解决了传统标签平滑破坏类间关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标签平滑虽然能改善网络泛化能力，但为所有非目标类别分配相同概率，破坏了类间关系，需要一种能保持类间关系的新方法。

Method: 提出Label Smoothing++策略，为目标类别使用固定标签，同时让网络学习非目标类别的标签，考虑类间关系来分配概率。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效缓解过度自信预测，同时促进类间关系和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++通过更好地建模类间关系，在保持标签平滑优势的同时解决了其局限性，是一种有效的标签正则化方法。

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一种新颖工具和实证见解，使得物体检测中的人机协作主动学习标注流程更加透明、可管理并可能更有效。

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，ResNet-50作为教师、ResNet-18作为学生的实验显示，方法超越了固定权重知识蓄粉基线，并实现更稳定的收敛

Conclusion: 动态调整知识蓄粉中硬软监督的权重比优于固定方式，能够根据学生-教师差异自适应地优化训练过程

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

Conclusion: FRC作为计算效率更高的剪枝方法，能够达到与ORC相当的剪枝效果，为神经网络压缩提供了有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

Conclusion: 结构化多模态证据与显式自我批判循环的结合是实现可靠且可迁移视觉理解的有前景路径

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

Method: 建立大规模手写数据库（42人手写1200字符），升级OpenHandWrite_Toolbox工具箱，采用多元回归分析手写准备和执行过程

Result: 字形因素在字符、部首和笔画三个层面都影响手写准备和执行；语音因素在所有层面影响执行；语言效应呈现层级刻衰特征（字符层>90e8首层>7b14画层）

Conclusion: 部首和笔画层面的手写过程与语言组件密切相关，该数据库和工具箱为语言心理学和语言神经学研究提供了价值资源

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注跌倒检测，但跌倒发生前的预测以及稳定状态与即将跌倒之间的瞬态状态分析尚未得到充分探索，这对于辅助机器人系统至关重要。

Method: 使用混合模型结合动态图神经网络(DGNN)和LSTM网络，DGNN作为分类器区分稳定、瞬态和跌倒三种步态状态，LSTM网络预测后续时间步的人类运动，实现早期跌倒检测。

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

Conclusion: 硬聚类在计算效率上优势明显，而软聚类在分割准确性方面更优，临床应用需根据具体需求选择合适的聚类方法

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision

classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

Motivation: 解决先前蒸馏采样方法中普遍存在的过平滑伪影问题，提升文本到图像编辑的质量和保真度。

Method: 提出Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF)框架，显式建模源和目标速度场差异，引入时间相关偏移项将噪声潜在向量推向目标轨迹。

Conclusion: DVRF成功弥合了基于分数的扩散优化和基于速度的整流流优化，为FlowEdit方法提供了理论解释，实现了高质量的无反演图像编辑。

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,

Conclusion: 频率感知优化对实现质高的图像表示至关重要，该方法在内容创建、神经渲染和医学成像等领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

*Andrzej D. Dobrzycki,Ana M. Bernardos,José R. Casar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究分析了YOLOv8和YOLOv10在资源受限环境中的层冻结策对转移学习效果的影响，发现最优冻结策依赖于数据特性，能节省辅28%的GPU内存使用量，某些情况下甚至超越全量微调的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然层冻结是常见的转移学习技术，但对于当代YOLOv8和YOLOv10架构中不同冻结配置的具体影响仍未得到充分研究，特别是在资源受限的UAV环境中部署时。

Method: 系统性研究多种冻结配置在YOLOv8和YOLOv10变体上的效果，使用4个具有挑战性的关键基础设施监控数据集。方法包括梯度行为分析（L2范数）和可视化解释（Grad-CAM），以提供更深入的训练动态见解。

Result: 结果显示不存在通用的最优冻结策策略，而是依赖于数据特性。冻结背骨网络有效保留通用特征，而浅层冻结更适合处理极端类别不平衡。这些配置与全量微调相比能节省辅28%的GPU内存消耗，某些情况下甚至超越全量微调的mAP@50分数。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了实证研究结果和实践指南，为在资源有限场景中选择物体检测的冻结策略提供了基于证据的平衡转移学习方法。

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

*Bryce Grant,Peng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QUAN是一种新型四元数近似网络，通过实数运算近似四元数卷积，保持几何特性同时实现高效计算，在图像分类和物体检测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统四元数神经网络完全在四元数域操作计算复杂，需要开发一种既能保持旋转等变特性又能高效实现的深度学习框架。

Method: 通过Hamilton乘积分解用实数运算近似四元数卷积，引入独立四元数批归一化(IQBN)保证训练稳定性，并将四元数操作扩展到空间注意力机制。

Result: 在图像分类任务中，QUAN以更少参数和更快收敛速度获得更高准确率；在物体检测任务中，相比标准CNN具有更好的参数效率和旋转处理能力，在四元数CNN中达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: QUAN框架在保持几何特性的同时实现了高效计算，特别适合资源受限的机器人系统和其他需要旋转感知的应用领域。

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

TL;DR: VALA方法通过可见性感知语言聚合和流式加权几何中值，解决了3D高斯分布中背景噪声和多视角不一致问题，提升了开放词汇定位和分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个基本问题：背景高斯分布对渲染像素贡献很小但获得与前景相同的特征，以及由于语言嵌入中视角特定噪声导致的多视角不一致性

Method: 提出可见性感知语言聚合(VALA)，计算每条光线的边际贡献并应用可见性感知门控保留可见高斯分布；提出在余弦空间中使用流式加权几何中值来合并噪声多视角特征

Result: VALA在参考数据集上改善了开放词汇定位和分割性能，一致超越了现有工作

Conclusion: VALA方法以快速且内存高效的方式产生了鲁棒、视角一致的语言特征嵌入

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的表示学习框架DuoCLR，通过预训练修剪后的骨架序列来提升人体动作分割性能。该框架采用新颖的数据增强策略和两个代理任务，在多尺度表示学习中取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表示学习方法主要针对动作识别任务，基于孤立的序列级表示，而动作分割需要利用多尺度表示和跨序列变化来更好地处理未修剪视频中的连续动作序列。

Method: 提出了'Shuffle and Warp'数据增强策略生成多样化的多动作排列，并引入两个对比学习代理任务：Cross Permutation Contrasting (CPC)学习同类动作的相似性，Relative Order Reasoning (ROR)推理类间上下文关系。

Result: 在未修剪数据集上的实验表明，DuoCLR在多类和多标签动作分割任务中都显著优于现有最先进方法。消融研究验证了各组成部分的有效性。

Conclusion: 该对比学习框架通过创新的数据增强和双代理任务设计，成功学习了适用于动作分割的多尺度特征表示，为基于骨架的动作分割提供了有效的预训练解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 事件相机在动态去模糊中具有潜力，但现有方法忽视事件流的内在不完整性。本文提出RED网络，通过随机投影策略和解耦关注机制，提升了去模糊的准确性和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件引导的去模糊方法忽视了事件流的内在不完整性问题，这是由于DVS阈值机制在敏感性和噪声之间的批执。这种退化影响了运动先验知识的完整性，限制了事件引导去模糊的效果。

Method: 提出RED网络：1)稳健性导向的批打策略(RPS)，通过随机投影事件暴露网络于不完整模式；2)解耦全注意力(OmniAttention)，显式建模内部运动、运动间和跨模态相关性；3)两个交互模块增强模糊图像中的运动敏感区域并向事件表征注入语义上下文。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，RED网络在准确性和稳健性方面均达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过处理事件流的内在不完整性和模态特定的解耦表征，RED网络有效提升了事件引导去模糊的性能。

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

Motivation: 解决现有后训练量化方法迭代参数更新导致的高计算复杂度和资源开销问题，适用于资源受限的边缘计算和实时推理场景

Method: 基于参数敏感性分析，优先量化高敏感性参数，利用列向聚类特性引入行并行量化框架和全局共享逆Hessian矩阵更新机制

Result: 在ResNet-50和YOLOv5s上实验验证，量化速度比Optimal Brain Quantization基准提升20-200倍，平均准确率损失低于0.3%

Conclusion: 该方法有效场散了量化效率与准确性之间的平衡，适用于资源受限环境的高效模型压缩需求

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Result: 在512x512分辨率下达到90FPS渲染速度，定量和定性实验均优于现有最先进方法，且遵循缩放定律。

Conclusion: 该分离框架在保持高驱动效率的同时，显著提升了单图像3D头像生成的泛化能力和重建质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MFFI数据集成功解决了现有数据集在真实场景多样性方面的局限性，为Deepfake检测提供了更真实、更具挑战性的基准测试平台，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

Motivation: 传统视频摘要方法主要关注帧间全局时序建模，但忽略了细粒度视觉实体（如对象）与视频主要内容的高度相关性。语言引导的视频摘要需要全面理解复杂真实世界视频的语义信息

Conclusion: 将视频摘要建模为语言引导的时空图问题，通过语义关系建模和递归优化策略，能够有效提升视频摘要的质量和准确性

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型剪枝方法仅使用当前动作的局部信息，忽略历史动作的全局上下文，导致成功率下降超过20%且加速效果有限

Method: 提出三层剪枝策略：静态动作级剪枝（利用全局历史和局部上下文）、动态层级剪枝（基于层级重要性）、轻量级动作感知控制器（根据动作粒度调整剪枝强度）

Result: 在LIBERO数据集上，相比OpenVLA-OFT，在NVIDIA A800上实现1.46倍加速，在NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090上实现1.57倍加速，成功率损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 结合局部和全局信息的智能剪枝方法能有效提升VLA模型的计算效率，同时保持性能稳定

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Subspace Mapping (SuMa)方法，专门用于从文本到图像扩散模型中精确擦除窄概念（如版权角色、名人），在保持图像质量的同时实现鲁棒的概念移除


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法无法同时满足鲁棒性和有效性，特别是对于窄概念（如版权角色、名人）的擦除存在挑战，这些概念与非目标概念距离很近，需要更精细的操作

Method: SuMa首先推导出表示待擦除概念的目标子空间，然后通过将其映射到最小化两个子空间距离的参考子空间来实现概念中和，确保目标概念被鲁棒擦除的同时保持图像质量

Result: 在四个任务（子类擦除、名人擦除、艺术风格擦除、实例擦除）上的广泛实验表明，SuMa在图像质量上与专注于有效性的方法相当，同时在完整性方面与专注于完整性的方法结果相当

Conclusion: SuMa方法成功解决了窄概念擦除的挑战，实现了鲁棒性和有效性的平衡，为处理版权和法律问题提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空遥感中的多光谱和RGB成像技术推动了精准农业的发展，但高光谱图像标签有限或无标签的情况下进行分析具有挑战性。

Method: 采用自监督学习方法构建神经网络嵌入空间，该空间能够反映树木的植被特性，从航空高光谱图像中提取树木表征。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用植被特性相关嵌入空间构建的树木表征，在下游机器学习任务中的性能优于直接使用高光谱植被特性作为树木表征的方法。

Conclusion: 自监督学习能够有效提取高光谱图像中的植被特性信息，构建的神经网络嵌入表示在下游任务中具有更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

TL;DR: 研究评测了六种YOLO模型在孜加拉地区特有车辆检测任务上的性能，YOLOv11x表现最优但速度慢，中等模型在性能和速度之间取得平衡，突出了开发地区特定自动驾驶技术的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为基于非孜加拉数据集训练的车辆检测系统在孜加拉特有道路环境中识别本地车辆类型时表现差异，影响了自动驾驶技术在发展中地区的应用。

Method: 使用移动手机摄像头采集高清图片，手动标注构建包含29种特定车辆类别的孜加拉车辆数据集，对六种YOLO模型变体进行性能评测。

Result: YOLOv11x表现最优（mAP@0.5为63.7%）但速度慢，中等模型在性能和速度之间取得最佳平衡，缺乏训练样本的稀有车辆类别检测准确度极低。

Conclusion: 研究为开发适用于孜加拉道路环境的健壮物体检测系统奠定了基础，解决了通用模型在发展中地区效果不佳的问题。

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditIDv2是一个无需调优的解决方案，专门针对高复杂度叙事场景和长文本输入设计，通过改进ID特征集成模块和引入新训练策略，在保持身份一致性的同时实现深度语义编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有角色编辑方法在简单提示下表现良好，但在面对包含多层语义、时间逻辑和复杂上下文关系的长文本叙事时，往往出现编辑能力下降、语义理解偏差和身份一致性崩溃的问题。

Method: 通过PerceiverAttention的精细分解、引入ID损失和与扩散模型的联合动态训练，以及集成模块的离线融合策略，在少量数据润滑下实现深度多级语义编辑。

Result: 在IBench评估中取得优异结果，满足了长提示和高质量图像生成的需求。

Conclusion: EditIDv2成功解决了复杂叙事环境中的身份一致性维护和深度语义编辑问题，为长文本输入的高质量图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的场景图预测方法主要依赖视觉线索，缺乏对常识知识的有效利用，导致长期预测稳健性不足。

Method: 提出对象导向的两阶段方法(OOTSM)：首先使用大语言模型预测对象的出现咊消失，然后生成详细的人物关系。采用细调的开源LLM模型在Action Genome数据集上进行评测。

Result: 实验结果显示：短期mean-Recall(@10)提升3.4%，长期mean-Recall(@50)显著提升21.9%，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 通过明确利用常识知识咊分解预测任务，语言模型可以有效提升场景图预测的准确性咊稳健性，特别是在长期预测中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过射线物理的堆积污染减少原理来提升图像去噪的稳健性，特别是在高噪声条件下显示优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高能物理学中的堆积污染问题与图像去噪有相似性，强化物理导向的归纳偏见可能提升模型在强污染下的稳健性

Method: 提出了PU启发的去噪器层次：包括带守恒约束的残差CNN、高斯噪声变种以及WIPUNet（结合UNet背景的物理启发网络）

Result: 在CIFAR-10和BSD500数据集上，PU启发CNN与标准基线相当，WIPUNet在高噪声条件下显示凸显优势，证明物理启发偏见提供了更好的稳健性

Conclusion: 物理导向的归纳偏见能够在不依赖重型SOTA机器的情况下显著提升高噪声条件下的去噪稳健性

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

TL;DR: CAMVR框架通过视觉-文本上下文记忆单元和自适应视觉聚焦机制，解决了多轮视觉对话中的上下文丢失和幻觉问题，在多个数据集上实现了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和视觉语言大模型在单轮任务表现优秀，但在需要深度上下文理解和复杂视觉推理的多轮交互中存在推理碎片化、上下文丢失和幻觉等挑战。

Method: 提出CAMVR框架，包含两个关键创新：1）视觉-文本上下文记忆单元(VCMU) - 动态读写记忆网络，存储管理每轮的视觉特征、文本语义表示及其跨模态对应关系；2）自适应视觉聚焦指导(AVFG)机制 - 利用VCMU上下文动态调整视觉编码器对相关图像区域的注意力。采用多层次推理集成策略确保响应生成与当前输入和历史上下文深度一致。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数据集（包括VisDial、改编的A-OKVQA和新构建的多轮指令跟随MTIF数据集）上进行广泛实验，CAMVR始终实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CAMVR框架有效增强了视觉语言大模型的多轮视觉-文本推理能力，解决了现有模型在多轮交互中的关键限制，为复杂多模态对话系统提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MeshMetrics框架，通过网格基硅计算更准确的距离基指标，解决了图像分割预测评估中的重现性危机问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割预测评估存在重现性危机，开源工具在距离基指标实现上存在显著差异（如Hausdorff距离差异100mm，标准化表面距离差异30%），影响结果的可靠性。

Method: 提出MeshMetrics框架，采用网格基硅方法计算距离基指标，比传统的格点基方法更准确。进行了理论分析和实验验证。

Result: MeshMetrics在准确性和精确度方面都超过现有工具，对离散化效应（如距离量化）的影响更小。

Conclusion: MeshMetrics作为开源Python包发布，提供了更可靠的距离基指标计算方法，有助于提高图像分割预测评估的重现性。

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

TL;DR: LVLM-VAR是一个新颖的视频动作识别框架，利用预训练的视觉-语言大模型，通过视频到语义令牌转换和LoRA微调，在NTU RGB+D等基准测试中实现了最先进性能，同时提高了模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在深度语义理解、复杂上下文信息和细粒度区分方面存在局限，无法有效处理多样化的视频数据。受大语言模型强大能力的启发，需要开发能够更好理解视频动作语义的新方法。

Method: 提出Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST)模块，将原始视频序列转换为离散的、语义和时间一致的"语义动作令牌"，创建LVLM可理解的"动作叙述"。结合自然语言指令，通过LoRA微调的LVLM（如LLaVA-13B）进行处理，实现动作分类和语义推理。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进或极具竞争力的性能：NTU RGB+D X-Sub达到94.1%，NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set达到90.0%。同时通过生成自然语言解释显著提升了模型可解释性。

Conclusion: LVLM-VAR成功将预训练视觉-语言大模型应用于视频动作识别，不仅在准确性方面表现出色，还通过语义令牌和自然语言解释增强了模型的可解释性，为视频理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法对复杂视角变化的鲁棒性，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过融合几何结构信息和语义信息，JRN-Geo网络有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的视角差异问题，为无人机定位导航提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 解决多模态传感器融合中的时间不一致性问题，提高下游SLAM任务的鲁棒性和性能

Method: 引入三种时间一致性机制：时间嵌入相似性对齐、运动对齐变换损失、窗口时间融合模块，并更新模型架构以保持空间结构

Result: 在雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换中展示了改进的时间和空间一致性，降低了绝对轨迹误差，提高了Cartographer SLAM中的占据地图精度

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T保持了即插即用的模态融合能力，同时显著增强了时间稳定性，为下游SLAM应用提供了更好的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性疾病需要严格的药物依从性来防止疾病进展和管理症状，但患者行为、医疗成本高等因素经常影响依从性。需要一种能够通过视频分析自动监测药物依从性的方法。

Method: 使用806个临床专家标注的结核病药物监测视频数据集(LLM-TB-VQA)对Video-LLaVA模型进行微调，识别患者面部清晰度、药物可见性、饮水动作等视觉特征与医疗概念的关联。

Result: 在参数高效微调(PEFT)设置下，模型性能超越LLaVA-V1.5和Chat-UniVi等基线模型，绝对提升3.1%到3.54%。消融研究和注意力图可视化验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AdCare-VLM成功整合了对齐的视觉-语言表示，改善了多模态交互，为药物依从性监测提供了一种可解释且有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, HIV-AIDS,
epilepsy, and tuberculosis, necessitate rigorous adherence to medication to
avert disease progression, manage symptoms, and decrease mortality rates.
Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior,
caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare
infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based
multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question
answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We
employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB)
medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to
fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a
detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and
ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual
features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water
intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in
captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic
representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results
indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute
improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and
attention map visualizations substantiate our approach, enhancing
interpretability.

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

Motivation: 传统单图超分辨假设空间不变的降级模型，但真实成像系统存在复杂的距离依赖效应，如大气散射、景深变化和透视扭曲等，需要空间适配性重建策略。

Method: 提出一种严格的变分框架，将超分辨形式化为空间变化逆问题，通过深度条件卷积内核实现秩式温度流动力学，并统一理论能量函数与神经网络学习。

Result: 在5个标准数据集上达到最先进性能，在KITTI外场场景上2倍和4倍缩放下分别获得36.89/0.9516和30.54/0.8721的PSNR/SSIM值，比现有方法分别提高0.44dB和0.36dB。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了第一个理论基础坚实的距离适配性超分辨框架，在深度变化场景中实现了显著改进，同时在传统标准上保持竞争力。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有工作大多只考虑单人或仅关注对话手势，假设身体方向和位置基本不变。本文旨在捕捉更真实、动态、语义一致的长期双人交互行为。

Method: 构建了包含241个运动序列的多模态InterAct数据集，提出分层回归身体运动的扩散方法，并设计了新颖的微调机制提高嘴唇准确性。

Result: InterAct数据集包含丰富复杂的个体运动和长期交互模式，提出的方法能有效从语音生成协调的双人交互动作和表情。

Conclusion: 该工作为双人交互行为建模提供了高质量数据集和有效方法，推动了动态交互行为生成研究的发展。

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

Motivation: 当前方法在处理复杂组合式描述时，依赖整体视觉-语言融合而表现不佳，特别是在外观相似但运动和姿态不一致的对象场景中。

Method: 1) 将自然语言查询解析为结构化语义命令；2) 时空定位模块生成所有候选轨迹；3) 分层识别模块通过两阶段推理（粗粒度运动推理和细粒度姿态验证）选择正确目标。

Result: 在Ref-YouTube-VOS、Ref-DAVIS17和MeViS三个主要基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS通过分层推理框架有效解决了复杂语言描述下的视频对象分割问题，无需训练即可实现优异的性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文作为最古老的汉字形式，其解读对理解人类早期生产方式至关重要。当前解读方法受限于考古发掘的零散性和铭文语料有限。大型多模态模型强大的视觉感知能力为甲骨文视觉解读提供了新可能。

Method: 构建PictOBI-20k数据集，包含20k精心收集的甲骨文和实物图像，形成15k+多选题。进行主观标注以研究人类与LMM在视觉推理中参考点的一致性。通过实验评估通用LMM的视觉解读能力。

Result: 实验表明通用LMM具备初步的视觉解读技能，但LMM并未有效利用视觉信息，大多数时候受限于语言先验。人类与LMM在视觉推理中的参考点一致性有待提高。

Conclusion: PictOBI-20k数据集可为未来甲骨文导向的LMM的视觉注意力评估和优化提供支持，促进甲骨文视觉解读技术的发展。代码和数据集将在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学形态重建中，训练数据与目标形状的姿态对齐差异导致偏差解，尤其在观察小部分形状时。这个问题常被忽视，但对重建结果致关重要。

Method: 提出一种高效方法来调整现有模型以适应特定目标形状。该方法保持线性模型的计算效率，无需访问原始训练数据，能够精确恢复平移对齐并提供小旋转的良好近似。

Result: 方法显著提高了重建精度和预测方差的准确性，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法可以作为一个简单的预处理步骤集成到现有的形态重建流程中，具有广泛的插件化应用前景。

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

TL;DR: PointPillars的两阶段改进版本，通过3DPillars CNN结构和稀疏场景特征模块，在保持高效率的同时提升了3D检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PointPillars在伪图像表示中无法保留精确3D结构以及难以实现两阶段检测流程的限制

Method: 提出3DPillars CNN结构，通过可分离汇組特征模块从伪图像中学习3D特征；以及稀疏场景特征模块汇聚多尺度特征完善检测

Result: 在KITTI和Waymo Open数据集上表现优异，在保持高效率的同时提升了检测精度

Conclusion: 该方法实现了速度与准确性的良好平衡，缩小了PointPillars与最先进方法的性能差距

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

Motivation: 解决现有相机-雷达融合方法中前向投影导致BEV特征稀疏，以及反向投影存在深度模糊导致误检的问题

Method: 使用反向投影技术，结合图像密集但不准确的深度分布与雷达稀疏但精确的深度信息，通过空间交叉注意力机制增强3D场景理解

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到62.4% NDS和54.0% mAP，在基于反向投影的相机-雷达融合方法中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: CRAB模型有效解决了深度模糊问题，通过相机和雷达的互补特性实现了更好的3D目标检测和分割性能

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗设备制造中的视觉检测面临小样本、数据不平衡、高分辨率图像和严格监管要求的挑战，需要开发能够在这些约束条件下工作的深度异常检测方法。

Method: 第一种方法使用基于结构相似性的异常评分（4-MS-SSIM），提供轻量级实时缺陷检测；第二种方法使用马氏距离评分对降维潜在特征进行处理，提供对分布偏移的高敏感性监控。

Result: 第一种方法在仅有10%缺陷样本的测试集上达到ACC 0.903（无监督阈值）和0.931（有监督阈值）；第二种方法在有监督阈值下达到ACC 0.722，均优于重新实现的基线方法。

Conclusion: 两种方法提供互补能力：第一种支持可靠的在线检测，第二种支持可扩展的生产后监控和监管合规监测，为在受监管制造环境中部署深度异常检测提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic SAM是SAM的概率扩展版本，通过引入潜在变量空间和变分目标训练，能够生成反映人类标注变异性的多样化分割掩码，特别适用于医学图像中存在标注不确定性的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可提示分割模型（如SAM）是确定性的，只能为每个提示生成单一分割结果，无法捕捉真实世界任务中固有的模糊性。这在医学成像中尤其成问题，因为标注不确定性或专家间变异性可能导致多个合理的分割结果。

Method: 在SAM框架中集成先验网络和后验网络，通过潜在变量空间调节提示嵌入，使用变分目标进行训练，学习生成多样化且合理的分割掩码分布。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI肺结节数据集上的评估显示，Probabilistic SAM能够产生与专家分歧一致的多样化输出，在不确定性感知指标上优于现有概率基线方法。

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM成功扩展了SAM的概率能力，能够有效处理医学图像分割中的不确定性，为不确定性感知的分割任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

Result: 在17个独立MODIS场景中，模型达到约0.92的准确率，均方误差为0.014。风沘核心区域呈现强一致性，大部分错误出现在边缘区域。

Conclusion: 聚合频带-空间学习方法能够提供全球范围的及时风沘警报，使用更大的输入窗口或注意力模型可能进一步提高边缘检测精度。

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Result: 验证准确率93.55%，测试准确率93.89%，精确率93.86%，F1分数93.85%，Cohen's Kappa和Matthews相关系数均为93%，均方根误差0.1205，平均绝对误差0.0156，优于9个流行的迁移学习骨干网络。

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT模型推进了人工智能在肌肉骨骼风险分类中的应用，能够实现有效的早期干预，为运动医学领域提供了创新的多模态解决方案。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

Conclusion: 基于CLIP的语义压缩方法为新兴应用提供了有效的解决方案，在极低比特率下实现了跨任务和数据的语义保持

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriPrompt是一个新颖的深度提示学习框架，通过利用CLIP视觉编码器的中间层特征来增强文本语义表示，解决了现有方法过度依赖对比学习和静态提示的问题，在多个基准测试中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度文本提示方法存在两个关键局限：过度依赖对比学习目标而忽视细粒度特征优化；所有输入类别使用静态提示，缺乏内容感知适应能力。

Method: 提出AttriPrompt框架，包含属性检索模块（聚类视觉特征并检索语义相似提示）、双流对比学习实现细粒度对齐，以及自正则化机制防止过拟合。

Result: 在三个基准测试中优于最先进方法，在base-to-novel设置下实现了最高7.37%的性能提升，在跨域知识迁移方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法使视觉-语言预训练模型成为现实世界应用中更可行的解决方案，通过分层视觉信息和动态提示机制显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

Motivation: 现有Flow Matching模型使用SDE采样会引入明显噪声，影响奖励学习过程和生成图像质量

Method: 受DDIM启发，提出Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS)方法，重新制定采样过程，消除噪声伪影

Result: CPS方法消除了噪声，实现了更准确的奖励建模，使Flow-GRPO和Dance-GRPO等强化学习优化器收敛更快更稳定

Conclusion: CPS采样方法有效解决了SDE采样的噪声问题，为强化学习在Flow Matching模型中的应用提供了更好的基础

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Motivation: 医学图像存在噪声、模糊、对比度低等问题，传统增强技术可能会修改原图的关键诊断信息，需要新方法来充分利用原始和增强图像的优势

Method: 提出双向交互融合模块(DIFM)，使用双向跨注意力同时关注不同图像的对应空间信息，通过全局空间注意力精炼互补特征，并主动引入基于梯度提取的多尺度边界损失函数

Result: 在ACDC和Synapse数据集上进行实验，方法在数量和质量上都显示出优劢性能

Conclusion: DIFM模块能够有效利用原始和增强图像的互补信息，通过隐式关联从低级到高级的结构属性，生成富含重要空间特征的增强特征，显著提高了医学图像分割的准确性

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

Abstract: The deployment of high-accuracy 3D object detection models from point cloud
remains a significant challenge due to their substantial computational and
memory requirements. To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel
lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the
novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to
capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D
convolutions into asymmetric strip convolutions, SAB efficiently extracts
directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to
linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that
integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline
PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms
recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while establishing itself as a practical
solution for real-world 3D detection on edge devices.

Conclusion: 神经网络方法能够在节省计算资源的同时实现更快速的实时熟光效果，推动实时渲染向更高实体感和流畅体验发展

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够与现有方法达到相当的性能水平，同时有助于直观理解自监督学习过程

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种既具备解释性又能保持性能的方法，有效解决了医学3D自监督学习中的空间知识表征问题

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

TL;DR: OmniStyle2通过去风格化方法将艺术风格转换重构为数据问题，创建DST-100K大规模数据集，训练出简单但性能优越的前馈模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决艺术风格转换中缺乏真实监督数据的基本挑战，通过去风格化方法获得真实艺术风格与底层内容的对齐监督信号

Method: 开发文本引导的去风格化模型DST重建无风格内容，使用多阶段评估模型DST-Filter自动过滤低质量数据对，基于DST-100K数据集训练FLUX.1-dev前馈模型

Result: OmniStyle2在定性和定量基准测试中一致超越最先进方法，证明了通过去风格化进行可扩展数据生成的有效性

Conclusion: 去风格化为艺术风格转换提供了可靠的监督范式，克服了缺乏真实数据的基本挑战

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在测试数据分布与训练数据不同时的性能下降问题，特别是当训练领域有限或与未见测试领域差距较大时现有方法效果不佳

Method: 提出ConstStyle方法：1）构建统一领域捕获领域不变特征；2）训练时将样本映射到该统一领域；3）测试时同样将未见领域样本投影到统一领域进行预测

Result: 在多种场景下一致优于现有方法，当只有有限训练领域时，相比次优方法准确率提升高达19.82%

Conclusion: ConstStyle通过统一领域对齐有效减少了领域偏移的影响，特别是在训练领域有限或领域差距大的情况下表现出色

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Conclusion: 理解输入数据可以平衡对额外传感器或训练数据的需求，分割信息的引入能有效提升单目3D目标检测性能

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing

each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark

Motivation: 传统VQA系统假设单一答案和区域，但盲人和低视力用户拍摄的照片模糊、构图差，问题表述模糊，导致多个有效答案，需要系统能够处理这种模糊性

Method: 使用LoRA调优的BLIP-2模型生成多个候选答案，用PolyFormer进行空间定位，最后通过链式推理模块评估答案是否指向相同或不同区域

Result: 在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中优于先前方法，对辅助场景中常见的模糊性和视觉噪声更具鲁棒性

Conclusion: VQA系统需要适应真实的人类不确定性，为盲人和低视力用户提供包容性支持，该工作推动了相关研究和可访问性应用

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV
imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label
engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)
module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive
experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive
results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands
remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight
token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions
from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier
removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented
text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临短暂性、细微性和动态性挑战，现有手工特征方法需要关键帧，深度学习方法受限于小规模和低多样性训练数据

Method: 提出局部-全局特征感知Transformer进行帧表示学习，使用排序器计算帧级特征排序分数，通过时间维度池化捕获动态表示，并设计动态图像构建任务

Result: 在CASME II、SAMM、CAS(ME)^2和CAS(ME)^3数据集上F1分数分别提升4.05%、2.50%、7.71%和2.11%，优于现有最佳方法

Conclusion: FDP框架有效编码微表情动态信息，动态图像构建任务有助于捕获面部细微动作并缓解数据稀缺问题，在微表情识别和动态图像构建方面表现优异

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time
deployment.

Abstract: The reliable analysis of blood reports is important for health knowledge, but
individuals often struggle with interpretation, leading to anxiety and
overlooked issues. We explore the potential of general-purpose Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to address this challenge by automatically analyzing blood report
images. We conduct a comparative evaluation of three VLMs: Qwen-VL-Max, Gemini
2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, determining their performance on a dataset of
100 diverse blood report images. Each model was prompted with clinically
relevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then
processed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models
responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and
promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood
report analysis. Their ability to provide clear interpretations directly from
images can improve health literacy and reduce the limitations to understanding
complex medical information. This work establishes a foundation for the future
development of reliable and accessible AI-assisted healthcare applications.
While results are encouraging, they should be interpreted cautiously given the

Conclusion: 结合细节保持下采样、边缘敏感表示、双域注意力和难度自适应回归，为基于无人机的电网小缺陷检测提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Conclusion: BranchGRPO通过创新的分支采样和修剪策略，有效解决了GRPO的计算效率和训练稳定性问题，为生成模型对齐提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

Conclusion: IRG框架通过交织推理有效提升了文本到图像生成的指令遵循能力和细节保持能力，证明了推理过程对多模态生成任务的重要性

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,
showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

Conclusion: 顺序微调是适应基础模型到不断发展的临床任务的有效、知识保留的范式。

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its

address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our

Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像在农业、环境监测等领域有广泛应用，但存在空间分辨率与光谱分辨率的权衡问题。现有方法难以同时保持空间细节和光谱保真度。

Method: 提出SpecSwin3D模型，使用3D移位窗口Transformer框架，采用级联训练策略逐步扩展光谱范围，并设计优化的波段序列来更好地捕获波段间关系。

Result: 模型在PSNR达到35.82dB，SAM为2.40°，SSIM为0.96，比基线MHF-Net提升5.6dB PSNR，ERGAS降低一半以上。在下游任务如土地利用分类和烧毁区域分割中也表现出实用价值。

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D成功解决了多光谱到高光谱图像转换中的空间-光谱权衡问题，为遥感图像处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

TL;DR: RetinaGuard是一个隐私保护框架，通过生成对抗掩蔽机制隐藏视网膜年龄信息，同时保持图像质量和疾病诊断价值，防止生物信息泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI从医学图像中提取生物标志物（如视网膜年龄）存在隐私风险，未经授权使用可能导致生物信息泄露，需要保护个人隐私。

Method: 采用特征级生成对抗掩蔽机制，结合多对一知识蒸馏策略，利用视网膜基础模型和多样化替代年龄编码器，实现对抗黑盒年龄预测模型的通用防御。

Result: RetinaGuard成功混淆视网膜年龄预测，对图像质量和病理特征表示影响最小，可扩展到其他医学图像生物标志物。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了医学图像生物识别隐私问题，在保护隐私的同时保持了医疗诊断价值，具有很好的扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

TL;DR: UniVerse-1是一个统一的音频-视频生成模型，采用专家拼接技术融合预训练的视频和音乐生成模型，通过在线标注管道确保音视频对齐，在7600小时数据上微调后能生成协调的音视频内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统方法中基于文本标注的音视频对齐问题，以及避免从头训练的低效性，开发能够同时生成协调音频和视频的统一模型。

Method: 使用专家拼接(SoE)技术深度融合预训练的视频和音乐生成专家模型，开发在线标注管道处理训练数据并生成标注，避免文本标注不对齐导致的性能下降。

Result: 模型在7600小时音视频数据上微调后，能够生成环境声音协调的音视频内容，并在语音生成方面实现强对齐效果。创建了Verse-Bench基准数据集进行评估。

Conclusion: UniVerse-1通过创新的专家拼接和在线标注技术，成功实现了音视频的协调生成，为音视频生成研究提供了新的解决方案和基准工具。

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNO是一个统一的单阶段框架，用于视频场景图生成，同时处理粗粒度框级和细粒度像素级任务，通过扩展的slot attention机制和时序一致性学习实现高效的多粒度视觉内容建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频场景图生成方法通常针对特定粒度（框级或像素级）设计，需要任务特定的架构和多阶段训练流程，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出UNO框架，使用扩展的slot attention机制将视觉特征分解为对象和关系slot，引入对象时序一致性学习确保跨帧表示一致性，动态三元组预测模块捕捉时序交互。

Result: 在标准框级和像素级VidSGG基准测试中达到有竞争力的性能，同时通过统一的对象中心设计提高了效率。

Conclusion: UNO证明了统一框架在视频场景图生成中的有效性，能够以最小任务特定修改处理不同视觉粒度任务，为多粒度视觉理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Motivation: 解决全球骨折诊断挑战，特别是在资源匮乏地区缺乏专业放射科医生的问题，传统方法成本高、有辐射风险

Method: 使用定制卷积神经网络(CNN)，并与EfficientNetB0、MobileNetV2、ResNet50等迁移学习模型进行对比，在包含4083张X光片的FracAtlas数据集上进行训练

Result: 定制CNN达到95.96%准确率、0.94精确率、0.88召回率和0.91 F1分数，迁移学习模型在此特定设置下表现不佳

Conclusion: 轻量级CNN在X光骨折检测中具有潜力，强调公平基准测试、多样化数据集和外部验证对临床转化的重要性

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间关系理解方面存在局限，而现实世界的具身AI智能体（如机器人和自动驾驶汽车）需要基于自我中心多视角观测的空间推理能力。

Method: 创建包含8,600+问答对的Ego3D-Bench基准测试，并提出Ego3D-VLM后训练框架，通过生成基于估计全局3D坐标的认知地图来增强空间推理。

Result: 基准测试显示当前VLMs与人类水平存在显著差距，Ego3D-VLM在多选题上平均提升12%，在绝对距离估计上平均提升56%。

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench和Ego3D-VLM为在多视角环境中实现人类水平空间理解提供了有价值的工具，当前VLMs仍需改进空间推理能力。

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤障碍功能对皮肤健康和疾病抵抗至关重要，但SH和TEWL指标测量需要专业仪器，普通用户无法容易获得

Method: 构建多阶段系统解决方案，包括SH/TEWL数据收集、预处理、以及新题的Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型，使用对称对比正则化减少数据不平衡导致的偏差

Result: 首次实现从自拍面部图像进行皮肤评估而无需物理测量

Conclusion: 这项研究桥接了计算机视觉与护肤研究，为更广泛的实际应用开启了AI驱动的可访皮肤分析

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的视觉定位方法在标准场景表现良好，但在开放词汇场景（包含新物体类别）中存在三大限制：跨模态对齐不完美、跨模态特征融合不足、语义原型信息利用不充分

Method: 提出PAML框架：1)使用ALBEF进行初始跨模态特征对齐；2)视觉判别特征编码器增强显著物体表示；3)新颖的原型发现和继承机制提取聚合多邻居语义原型；4)多阶段解码器进行综合多模态整合和边界框回归

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，在标准场景中具有竞争力，在开放词汇场景中达到最先进的性能

Conclusion: PAML框架通过系统性地解决跨模态对齐、特征融合和语义原型利用问题，显著提升了视觉定位在开放词汇场景中的性能

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了视频领域的广义分类发现(Video-GCD)问题，并设计了一种新的内存导向一致性对比学习框架(MCCL)，通过时间-空间线索和全局上下文来提高新类别发现的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GCD方法主要聚焦于静态图像，但仅靠静态视觉内容不能可靠地发现新类别。需要将GCD扩展到视频领域，利用时间维度信息来提升发现性能。

Method: 提出MCCL框架，包含两个核心组件：一致性对比学习(CACL)和内存导向表征增强(MGRE)。CACL利用多视角时间特征估计一致性分数来调整对比损失，MGRE通过双级内存缓冲提供全局上下文来优化表征。

Result: 在行为识别和鸟类分类视频数据集上进行了涉广实验，结果显示方法显著超过了从图像设置适配者，证明了时间信息对视频新类别发现的重要性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将GCD扩展到视频领域，提出的MCCL框架通过时间-空间线索和全局上下文结合，为视频新类别发现提供了有效解决方案，开源代码将公开。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

Conclusion: 该工作证明了在MLLM框架内文本驱动图像分割的有效性、可扩展性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

Conclusion: MVP-FAS通过多视角和多文本策略有效提升了面部防伪检测的跨域泛化能力

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的货币评估框架，包含面额分类、损坏量化和防伪检测三个模块，适用于资源受限环境下的实时设备端推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有货币识别系统通常忽视可用性和真实性评估，特别是在低资源环境中，无法处理物理损坏和伪造问题，限制了实际应用

Method: 使用轻量级CNN模型进行面额分类，通过新颖的统一货币损坏指数(UCDI)进行损坏量化，采用基于特征的模板匹配进行假币检测

Result: 在82,000多张标注图像数据集上，Custom_CNN模型实现了高分类性能和低参数量，UCDI指标提供连续可用性评分，假币检测模块在不同成像条件下可靠识别伪造纸币

Conclusion: 该框架证明准确、可解释且紧凑的解决方案能够在实际环境中支持包容性货币评估，解决了受限环境中的关键部署挑战

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists
represent more than half of global traffic deaths, yet their detection remains
challenging in poor lighting, adverse weather, and unbalanced data sets. This
paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal
infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI,
BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light
augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments
show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy
and efficiency, while class-weighted losses enhance recall for rare VRUs.
Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and
RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of
multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.

Motivation: 时间敏感视频理解任务可以从帧内基于物体的信息中获益，但传统的文本注释方式会导致令牌长度增加和容易受到物体级信息噪声的影响。

Method: 设计GO-Tokenizer轻量级添加模块，利用现成的物体检测器实时编码紧凑的物体信息，以替代文本描述。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用GO-Tokenizer进行预训练的模型在性能上超过了原始视频-LLM和使用提示中文本物体描述的对照模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型、数据集和视频理解任务（如推理时间定位和密集描述）中都展现出良好的通用性。

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

Conclusion: 这个统一的深度学习网络为结直肠疾病诊断提供了一个更高效、更准确的方案，有望在临床应用中提高诊断质量和效率。

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂视觉环境中性能下降，现有增强方法需要额外训练或外部工具，忽视了模型内在的注意力机制能力

Method: 分析VLMs注意力模式，发现视觉复杂度与注意力熵相关；提出CARVE方法，通过通用查询和任务特定查询的注意力图对比，在像素级分解视觉信号为语义信号和视觉噪声

Result: CARVE一致提升性能，在开源模型上实现高达75%的改进

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视觉复杂度与注意力机制的相互作用，通过对比注意力为改进视觉推理提供了高效途径

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR),
traditional models often struggle to generalize across varying scale factors,
limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a plug-in
Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) designed to retrofit modern fixed-scale SR
models with the ability to perform arbitrary-scale SR. SAAM employs
lightweight, scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, incorporating
the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and
gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method
integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide
range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale
upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution
for real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑转移瘤症是癌症死亡的主要原因之一，但纷复杂的形态学图像分析对临床医生构成了巨大负担，很多随访图像没有被注释，仅仅通过观察评估。需要自动化方法来分析和预测治疗响应。

Method: 建立了一个自动化数据处理管道，收集了177名患者的896个脑转移瘤症的纷复杂形态学MRI数据。采用数据驱动聚类方法识别特征性增长轨迹，并使用梯度提升和图机器学习方法进行12个月病变响应预测。

Result: 聚类分析发现了5种主要增长轨迹，每种轨迹有明显不同的最终响应类型。梯度提升方法仅使用治疗前和第一次随访MRI即达到0.90 AUC的预测性能。图机器学习方法也获得0.88 AUC的稳健性能，且可以处理多个输入时间点配置。

Conclusion: 该研究为脑转移瘤症的纷复杂形态学MRI分析提供了自动化和高精度的解决方案，能够识别特征性增长模式并预测治疗响应。该管道为临床决策支持系统的开发奠定了基础，有助于优化个性化治疗。

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验Luo等人(2024)提出的FairCLIP方法的可重现性，调查其通过最小化Sinkhorn距离来改善CLIP模型组群公平性的方法是否有效。

Method: 重现原始实验设置，发现实现与描述差异后提出A-FairCLIP对比分析，并扩展出FairCLIP+支持多属性公平性优化，在哈佛-FairVLMed数据集上进血零样本青光眼分类实验。

Result: 虽然证实了CLIP存在人口统计学偏见，但实验结果并不支持FairCLIP能改善性能和公平性的断言。正式实现和A-FairCLIP在零样本青光眼分类中均未显示出改善效果。

Conclusion: 该研究对FairCLIP方法的可重现性提出了质疑，虽然正规化目标能够减小Sinkhorn距离，但并未转化为实际的性能和公平性提升，建议进一步研究距离最小化对模型行为的影响。

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

Motivation: 3DGS在大型场景中，输入视图通常来自有限空间区域，重建主要适用于相机位置小范围偏移的3DoF+场景。需要解决坐标量化对投影误差的影响问题。

Method: 研究位置误差对像素级投影误差的影响，发现投影误差与投影点距离的平方倒数成正比。基于此提出了球坐标量化方案。

Result: 在著名的Garden场景上展示了所提方法的率失真性能表现。

Conclusion: 针对3DoF+场景的特定需求，提出的球坐标量化方案能够有效处理坐标量化问题，改善投影精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

Conclusion: BioLite U-Net在分割准确性、效率和部署性方面都优于MobileNet基线模型，非常适合集成到智能闭环生物打印系统中。

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Motivation: 解决现有VCOD方法的两个主要问题：SAM方法因模型冻结而难以分离伪装目标边缘，MLLM方法因大语言模型合并前景和背景而导致目标可分离性差。

Method: 1) 使用时序和空间线索表示视频序列，通过LLM进行特征融合增加信息密度；2) 通过动态前景视觉令牌评分模块和提示网络生成多线索，自适应引导和微调SAM模型；3) 提出解耦的前景-背景学习策略，分别生成前景和背景线索进行解耦训练。

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight通过结合SAM和MLLM的优势，有效解决了视频伪装目标检测中的边缘分离和目标-背景分离问题，具有优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

Conclusion: 这是首个面向实际应用、无需标注的牛鼻检测解决方案，为畜牧监测提供了更具适应性和易部署性的实用替代方案

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new
possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github
repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: FSG-Net是一个频率-空间协同门控网络，通过频域处理和空间注意力机制解决高分辨率遥感图像变化检测中的伪变化和语义鸿沟问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像变化检测面临两个关键挑战：1）模型容易将时间偏移（如光照、季节变化）引起的辐射变化误判为真实变化，导致大量误报；2）深层抽象特征与浅层细节特征之间存在语义鸿沟，阻碍有效融合，导致边界划分不准确。

Method: 提出FSG-Net网络，包含三个核心模块：1）差异感知小波交互模块（DAWIM）在频域自适应处理不同频率分量，抑制伪变化；2）协同时空注意力模块（STSAM）在空间域增强真实变化区域的显著性；3）轻量级门控融合单元（LGFU）利用高层语义选择性门控和整合浅层关键细节。

Result: 在CDD、GZ-CD和LEVIR-CD三个基准数据集上验证，分别达到94.16%、89.51%和91.27%的F1分数，建立了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: FSG-Net通过频域和空间域的协同处理，有效解决了变化检测中的伪变化和特征融合问题，为高分辨率遥感图像变化检测提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于操作前后图像差异的弱监督分割方法，用于自动化工业废料分拣中的目标识别，并发布了包含11000多帧高分辨率图像的多视角数据集WS²。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业质量控制中，人工操作员在移动的异质流中识别不需要的物品仍然不可或缺。完全监督方法需要大量标注工作，而利用操作员移除动作提供的隐式监督的弱监督方法相对未被探索。

Method: 提出了Before-After Supervision概念，通过利用操作前后图像之间的视觉差异来训练分割网络。建立了一个包含11000多帧高分辨率视频帧的多视角数据集WS²，并开发了端到端管道来评估最先进的弱监督分割方法。

Result: 创建了首个用于废料分拣的多视角弱监督分割数据集WS²，包含操作前后的图像对，为研究提供了基准测试平台。

Conclusion: Before-After Supervision为工业废料分拣自动化提供了一种可行的弱监督解决方案，避免了大量标注需求，WS²数据集的发布将促进这一方向的研究发展。

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

TL;DR: TIDE框架通过目标监督和偏好学习解决主题驱动图像生成中保持主题身份与遵循编辑指令之间的张力，无需测试时微调即可实现优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理主题驱动图像生成时，无法充分解决保持主题身份与遵循动态编辑指令之间的冲突，需要新的框架来平衡这两方面需求。

Method: 提出目标监督三元组对齐方法，使用(参考图像、指令、目标图像)三元组建模主题适应动态，通过DSD目标训练模型，系统生成并评估"获胜"(平衡保持-遵循)和"失败"(扭曲)目标。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，TIDE在生成主题忠实输出同时保持指令遵循方面表现出优越性能，在多个量化指标上超越基线方法。

Conclusion: TIDE框架成功解决了主题驱动图像生成的核心挑战，展示了在结构条件生成、图像到图像生成和文本图像插值等多种任务中的通用性。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 深度学习图像表征与领域目标化政室形态学特征的协同结合，为神经脱射学自动化治疗响应评估提供了稳健有效的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

Method: 创建FMOX JSON格式元数据文件，添加物体大小信息；使用EfficientTAM基础模型在4个开源FMO数据集上进行测试；采用轨迹交并比(TIoU)指标进行性能评估。

Result: EfficientTAM模型在FMO数据集上表现与专门为这些数据集调整的直接流水线相比较为好。

Conclusion: FMOX JSON格式为FMO数据集提供了更丰富的地面真实信息，并证明基础模型在快速移动小物体跟踪任务中的效果，代码和数据已开源分享。

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in
this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open
source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we
extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth
information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally
we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for
tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with
the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines
aiming to process FMO datasets.

Result: 在FS-COCO和SketchyCOCO数据集上进行了涉及面广的实验，验证了方法的有效性，达到了最先进的性能水平

Conclusion: 训练设计在跨模态检索任务中具有关键作用，同时需要改进场景级SBIR的评估场景

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

*Runqing Yang,Yimin Fu,Changyuan Wu,Zhunga Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为“保持性角度表征学习”(RARL)的方法，用于解决增量开放集识别(IOSR)中的边界分辨力下降问题，通过在角度空间中对齐未知表征来缓解知识更新过程中的表征漏流问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放集识别方法通常设计用于静态场景，而在流动性场景中，模型需要从连续数据流中增量地识别新出现的未知类别并获取相应知识。由于对以前训练数据的访问受限，OSR决策边界的辨别性很难保持，导致严重的类间混淆。

Method: 提出保持性角度表征学习(RARL)：1)在均角紧架构建的角度空间中，鼓励未知表征对齐不活跃原型，以缓解知识更新过程中的过度表征漏流；2)采用虚拟-内在交互(VII)训练策略，通过边界近伴虚拟类来增强类间边际，使已知表征更突出；3)设计分层校正策略，精炼决策边界，减轻因旧/新类和正/负样本不平衡导致的表征偏差和特征空间扭曲。

Result: 在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上进行了彻底评估，并为IOSR建立了新的标杆。在各种任务设置下的实验结果表明，所提方法实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地解决了增量开放集识别中的边界分辨力下降问题，通过在角度空间中对齐未知表征和使用虚拟类来保持表征的稳定性。该方法为流动性开放集识别领域提供了有效的解决方案，并在多个数据集上验证了其优劢性能。

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学形态学在矢量值图像（如彩色和高光谱图像）处理中缺乏统一的矢量排序方法，需要找到最合适的排序方式来构建形态学算子。

Method: 采用机器学习方法学习一个简化排序，该排序近似于从一组矢量排序中推导出的Condorcet排序，受投票问题启发，Condorcet排序根据不同排序的投票结果对元素进行排名。

Result: 初步计算实验证实了学习简化映射在定义彩色图像矢量值形态学算子方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的机器学习方法能够有效学习近似Condorcet排序的简化排序，为矢量图像数学形态学提供了一种有前景的排序解决方案。

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

TL;DR: CausNVS是一个自回归的多视角扩散模型，支持任意输入输出视角配置，通过序列化生成视图来解决现有方法固定视角数和推理速度慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多视角扩散模型大多采用非自回归形式，限制了其在世界建模中的应用，因为它们只支持固定数量的视角，并且由于同时去噪所有帧而导致推理速度慢。

Method: 采用因果掩码和逐帧噪声训练，使用成对相对相机位姿编码(CaPE)实现精确相机控制。推理时结合空间感知滑动窗口、键值缓存和噪声条件增强来减轻漂移。

Result: 实验表明CausNVS支持广泛的相机轨迹，实现灵活的自回归新视角合成，并在多样化设置下保持一致的强视觉质量。

Conclusion: CausNVS通过自回归方法成功解决了多视角扩散模型的限制，为3D新视角合成提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低强度CT和PET虽然减少了放射风险，但会导致噪声和伪影增加，影响诊断准确性。需要一种能够提高图像质量的去噪方法。

Method: 设计了混合Swin注意力网络(HSANet)，包含高效全局注意力(EGA)模块和混合上采样模块。EGA模块增强空间和通道间的交互，混合上采样模块减少对噪声的过拟合风险。

Result: 在公开的LDCT/PET数据集上验证，HSANet在去噪性能方面超过现有方法，同时保持轻量化模型规模，适合在标准内存配置的GPU上部署。

Conclusion: 该方法为低强度CT和PET图像提供了高效的去噪解决方案，具有实际临床应用的潜力，能在保证放射安全的前提下提高诊断准确性。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过高速量解释机器人收集的海底视觉图像可以提高海洋监测和探索的效率。虽然最近的研究已经指出位置元数据可以增强自监督学习，但其在不同的SSL策略、模型和海底图像数据集上的好处很少被深入探索。

Method: 评估了位置基于正则化对六个最先进的SSL框架的影响，包括具有不同隐藏空间维度的卷积神经网络(CNN)和视觉Transformer(ViT)模型。在三个多样化的海底图像数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 位置正则化持续改善了下游分类性能，CNN和ViT的平均F1分数分别提高4.9±4.0%和6.3±8.9%。位置正则化的SSL在高维和低维隐藏表征上分别比预训练模型提高2.7±2.7%和10.1±9.4%。预训练ViT显示出强大的泛化能力，与最佳性能的位置正则化SSL相当。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示了位置元数据对SSL正则化的价值，尤其是在使用低维隐藏表征时，并证明了高维ViT在海底图像分析中的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无监督的在线聚类框架(OCF)，用于实时解释海底图像，支持长时间自主海洋探索任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长耐耕性和海底居留AUV的能力提升，需要实时解释海底图像来支持适应性任务和优化通信效率，而传统的离线图像分析方法无法满足实时要求。

Method: 提出了一种在线聚类框架(OCF)，能够在无监督情况下处理连续数据流。该方法通过识别和维护一组代表性样本来捐捕演化的特征分布，支持动态聚类合并和分割，而无需重新处理全部图像历史。

Result: 在三个多样化海底图像数据集上评估，OCF在所有比较的在线聚类方法中获得最高平均F1分数(0.68)，标准偏差为3%，显示了其优秀的聚类能力和对调查轨迹变化的稳健性。同时，随着数据量增加，计算时间保持在一致低且有界的水平。

Conclusion: OCF框架具有重要价值，特别是在生成调查数据摘要和支持信息化路径规划方面，对于长期、持续自主海洋探索具有重要意义。

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯泼溅方法需要精确深度信息，通常依赖RGB-D或立体相机，但这些设备深度感知范围有限，难以处理大场景。单目图像缺乏深度引导，导致新视角合成效果不佳。虽然大基础模型可进行单目深度估计，但存在跨帧不一致、远距离场景不准确和纹理欺骗等问题。

Method: 利用视觉惯性SfM提供的准确但稀疏的深度来优化大基础模型生成的密集但粗糙的深度。提出对象分割深度传播算法来处理结构化对象的深度渲染，并开发动态深度细化模块来处理动态对象的SfM深度缺陷。

Conclusion: VIM-GS成功解决了大场景中单目图像深度估计的挑战，通过结合稀疏和密集深度信息的优势，实现了高质量的新视角合成。

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

TL;DR: STAGE是一种面向分割的工业异常合成方法，通过分级扩散和显式掩码对齐技术，解决了现有方法在纹理细节、背景对齐和细粒度异常生成方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工业异常合成方法存在两个关键问题：合成的异常缺乏复杂纹理细节且与背景对齐不精确，以及难以生成细粒度的像素级异常。这限制了异常分割性能的提升。

Method: 提出了STAGE方法，包含三个核心创新：1）引入干净背景信息作为先验来指导去噪分布；2）采用分级扩散框架和异常专用分支来显式记录局部异常；3）使用显式掩码对齐策略逐步对齐合成异常与背景。

Result: 在MVTec和BTAD数据集上的大量实验表明，STAGE在工业异常合成方面达到了最先进的性能，并有效提升了下游异常分割任务的性能。

Conclusion: STAGE通过创新的异常推理策略和分级扩散框架，成功解决了工业异常合成中的关键挑战，为异常分割提供了更高质量的合成数据，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

Conclusion: Zo3T框架通过创新的3D感知技术和测试时自适应机制，成功解决了轨迹引导视频生成中的3D真实性和运动准确性问题，为无需大量标注数据的视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

Method: 通过直接访问原始Bayer数据并绕过传统图像信号处理器(ISP)，基于DVS-Voltmeter模型构建可配置的仿真框架，并设计了支持原始数据、RGB和事件流同步记录的数据采集管道。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited
resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,
particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time
event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time
operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based
vision research and early-stage system development.

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at

interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset

Result: 创建了首个提供明确运动幅度控制基准的数据集，能够生成从最小到极端的可变运动幅度范围，为各种图像和视频恢复任务提供高质量、可扩展的地面真值数据。

Conclusion: MIORe和VAR-MIORe数据集通过提供受控和不利条件下的高质量基准，为下一代图像和视频恢复算法的研究和评估铺平了道路，解决了现有基准的关键局限性。

Abstract: We introduce MIORe and VAR-MIORe, two novel multi-task datasets that address
critical limitations in current motion restoration benchmarks. Designed with
high-frame-rate (1000 FPS) acquisition and professional-grade optics, our
datasets capture a broad spectrum of motion scenarios, which include complex
ego-camera movements, dynamic multi-subject interactions, and depth-dependent
blur effects. By adaptively averaging frames based on computed optical flow
metrics, MIORe generates consistent motion blur, and preserves sharp inputs for
video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further
extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to
extreme, establishing the first benchmark to offer explicit control over motion
amplitude. We provide high-resolution, scalable ground truths that challenge
existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the
way for next-generation research of various image and video restoration tasks.

*Yufeng Cheng,Wenxu Wu,Shaojin Wu,Mengqi Huang,Fei Ding,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UMO是一个统一的多身份优化框架，通过多对多匹配范式和强化学习解决多参考图像下的身份一致性和身份混淆问题，显著提升了图像定制方法在身份保持方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类对脸部更加敏感，现有图像定制方法在多参考图像下难以保持身份一致性且容易产生身份混淆，限制了身份可扩展性。

Method: 提出UMO框架，将多身份生成重新表述为全局分配优化问题，通过扩散模型上的强化学习实现多身份一致性，并构建了包含合成和真实数据的多参考图像数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明UMO显著提高了身份一致性，减少了身份混淆，在身份保持维度上达到了开源方法的新最先进水平。

Conclusion: UMO有效解决了多身份图像定制中的身份一致性和混淆问题，为图像定制方法提供了可扩展的身份保持解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用对比学习和混合架构（CNN+LSTM+注意力机制）实现视频年龄分级分类，在Contextual Contrastive Learning框架下达到88%准确率和0.8815 F1分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频年龄分级方法需要大量标注数据、泛化能力差且特征学习效率低，无法满足快速增长的可视化内容消费需求

Method: 采用三种对比学习框架（实例判别、上下文对比学习、多视图对比学习），结合LRCN（CNN+LSTM）骨干网络和Bahdanau注意力机制，使用NT-Xent、NT-logistic和Margin Triplet等对比损失函数

Result: 在Contextual Contrastive Learning框架下取得最佳性能：88%准确率和0.8815 F1分数，能够有效区分PG-13和R级等细粒度边界

Conclusion: 提出的混合架构结合对比学习能够有效解决视频年龄分级问题，已部署为实时分类的Web应用，为流媒体平台提供自动化内容合规解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance
across streaming platforms.

TL;DR: Curia是一个在13万TB真实世界医学影像数据上训练的基础模型，在19项放射学任务中表现优异，达到或超过放射科医生水平，并展现出跨模态和少样本学习的涌现能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助放射学诊断主要依赖单一任务的窄模型，无法覆盖广泛的成像模态、疾病和放射学发现。基础模型具有跨模态泛化和少数据学习的潜力，但在放射学领域尚未实现。

Method: 使用一家大型医院数年的全部横断面成像输出数据（15万次检查，130TB）训练Curia基础模型，并在新构建的19任务外部验证基准上进行评估。

Result: Curia能够准确识别器官、检测脑出血和心肌梗死等疾病、预测肿瘤分期结果，在跨模态和少数据场景下展现出临床显著的涌现特性，性能达到或超过放射科医生和现有基础模型。

Conclusion: Curia展示了基础模型在放射学中的巨大潜力，为加速该领域发展，作者在Hugging Face上发布了模型权重。

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了通过迁移学习调整通用基础模型和整合手术室多模态数据来支持外科数据科学的方法，使用V-JEPA作为基础模型，在肝脏手术视频数据集上验证了领域适应和多模态融合的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何通过领域适应和整合手术室多模态数据来提升外科数据科学中基础模型的性能，解决外科手术中数据分析和决策支持的需求。

Method: 使用V-JEPA作为单模态基础模型，通过在未标记外科视频数据上进行微调实现领域适应，并整合手术室的时间分辨多模态数据流，构建多模态共享表示空间。

Result: 实验表明，领域特定数据的微调显著提升了模型性能，多模态数据整合在内部数据集上也有积极效果，在HeiCo数据集上单模态基线性能已达到EndoVis2017挑战赛顶级水平。

Conclusion: 研究证明了通用基础模型在外科数据科学中的潜力，领域适应和合适的多模态数据整合能进一步提升性能，为外科决策支持系统提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

content, where complex features like hair and transparency present unique
challenges. To address this limitation, we collected and annotated a custom
dataset of 1,228 high-quality anime images of characters and objects, and
fine-tuned the open-sourced BiRefNet model on this dataset. This resulted in
marked improvements in background removal accuracy for anime-style images,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种拓扑适应性变形模型，用于处理包含拓扑异常的3D网格匹配问题，能够在不依赖数据驱动预训的情况下处理高度非等距变形和拓扑异常的形状匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前方法在处理包含拓扑异常的3D网格匹配时的限制，特别是来自多视角重建的实际场景中的问题。现有方法假设变形是近等距或ARAP变形，但这些假设在某些拓扑配置下不成立。

Method: 提出拓扑适应性变形模型，允许形状拓扑发生变化来对齐形状对。通过聚合优化模板网格和其与待匹配形状的对齐，在ARAP和双射关联约束下提取对应关系。

Result: 该方法能够处理高度非等距变形和包含拓扑异常的形状，包括噪声多视角重建。在3D对齐质量上甚至超过了基于大量数据训练的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种无需数据驱动预训的方法，能够有效处理包含拓扑异常的3D网格匹配问题，在实际应用场景中展现了良好的性能。

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结合选择性GAN去模糊预处理和YOLOv5目标检测的自动车牌识别方案，在实时性和准确性方面取得了显著成效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动车牌识别(ALPR)在智慧城市中致关重要，但高变化性带来挑战，需要深度学习技术更有效处理。特别是当车牌图像模糊时，识别准确率会显著下降。

Method: 采用选择性GAN进行去模糊预处理，避免不必要的输入操作。结合YOLOv5对象检测架构进行车牌检测(LPD)，以及集成的字符分割(CS)和字符识别(CR)步骤。

Result: 车牌检测和字符识别时间仅0.026秒，支持实时应用。LPD准确率95%，CR准确率97%。添加Deblur-GAN预处理器后，检测准确率提高近40%，特别在模糊车牌场景中。

Conclusion: 结合YOLOv5和Deblur-GAN的综合模型在准确性和检测速度方面表现优异，适合移动应用。选择性预处理能够有效提升模糊场景下的识别性能。

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

Motivation: 现有欧几里得近似方法扭曲流形结构并减慢收敛速度，需要更好的方法来捕捉复杂流形结构

Method: 使用CNN-Transformer编码器提取特征嵌入，投影到球形空间，在双不变SO(4)空间中用Riemannian距离近似测地距离，推理时使用可微Levenberg-Marquardt优化

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上实验显示，在患者特定和患者无关场景中都获得了优越的准确性

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更具表达力和几何一致性的深度相似性度量，增强了区分细微姿态差异的能力

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

Conclusion: BIR-Adapter提供了一种高效、低复杂度的盲图像恢复解决方案，能够充分利用预训练扩散模型的优势，具有广泛的适用性和扩展性。

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

Motivation: 通用预训练模型在农业领域泛化能力不足，因为精细多变的冠层结构与波动的田间条件相互作用，需要作物特定的基础模型。

Method: 使用自监督学习方法在ImAg4Wheat数据集（10年收集的250万张小麦图像，涵盖2000+基因型和500+环境条件）上预训练小麦专用视觉基础模型。

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat

efficient Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool augmented agents to
interleave retrieval with reasoning and deliver actionable SOP. The framework

### [283] [MCTuner: Spatial Decomposition-Enhanced Database Tuning via LLM-Guided Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06298)
*Zihan Yan,Rui Xi,Mengshu Hou*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: MCTuner是一个自适应的数据库参数调优框架，通过混合专家机制和空间分解算法，有效减少配置空间探索成本，在OLAP、OLTP和HTAP基准测试中实现了19.2%的性能提升和1.4倍的配置发现速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据库参数调优面临配置空间庞大、参数数量多的挑战，现有学习方法要么忽略领域知识，要么在高维参数空间中探索困难，导致调优成本高且性能不佳。

Method: 采用混合专家(MoE)机制使用专门的LLMs识别性能关键参数，引入首个空间分解算法递归划分配置空间为层次子空间，并在子空间上执行贝叶斯优化来高效搜索近最优配置。

Result: 在不同基准测试(OLAP、OLTP和HTAP)中，MCTuner实现了最高19.2%的性能提升，每次迭代的配置发现速度比最先进方法快1.4倍。

Conclusion: MCTuner通过结合领域知识和高效空间探索策略，显著降低了数据库参数调优成本并提升了性能优化效果。

Abstract: Database knob tuning is essential for optimizing the performance of modern
database management systems, which often expose hundreds of knobs with
continuous or categorical values. However, the large number of knobs and the
vast configuration space make it difficult to identify optimal settings
efficiently. Although learning-based tuning has shown promise, existing
approaches either ignore domain knowledge by relying solely on benchmark
feedback or struggle to explore the high-dimensional knob space, resulting in
high tuning costs and suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we
propose MCTuner, an adaptive knob tuning framework that minimizes exploration
in ineffective regions of the configuration space. MCTuner employs a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with specialized LLMs to identify
performance-critical knobs. In further, MCTuner introduces the first spatial
decomposition algorithm that recursively partitions the space into hierarchical
subspaces, on which Bayesian Optimization is performed to efficiently search
for near-optimal configurations. Evaluated on different benchmarks (OLAP, OLTP,
and HTAP), MCTuner achieves up to 19.2% performance gains and 1.4x faster
configuration discovery per iteration compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了第一个统一的关系代数基础，引入关系幂运算来解决子集选择和优化查询问题，扩展了关系代数的表达能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据库社区缺乏统一的子集选择和优化查询语言，现有方法使用不兼容的SQL扩展，限制了用户表达和查询优化器的推理能力

Method: 1. 扩展关系代数支持域关系；2. 引入解决方案集的高阶关系代数；3. 提供结构保持的翻译语义到标准关系代数

Result: 实现了NP完全/困难问题的表达能力，同时为有限输入提供查询安全性，能够在一个单一范式中无缝表达数据管理、子集选择和优化查询

Conclusion: 该框架在提供理论清晰度和组合性质的同时，达到了最强大现有方法的表达能力，为统一的关系查询语言奠定了基础

Abstract: The database community lacks a unified relational query language for subset
selection and optimisation queries, limiting both user expression and query
optimiser reasoning about such problems. Decades of research (latterly under
the rubric of prescriptive analytics) have produced powerful evaluation
algorithms with incompatible, ad-hoc SQL extensions that specify and filter
through distinct mechanisms. We present the first unified algebraic foundation
for these queries, introducing relational exponentiation to complete the
fundamental algebraic operations alongside union (addition) and cross product
(multiplication). First, we extend relational algebra to complete domain
relations-relations defined by characteristic functions rather than explicit
extensions-achieving the expressiveness of NP-complete/hard problems, while
simultaneously providing query safety for finite inputs. Second, we introduce
solution sets, a higher-order relational algebra over sets of relations that
naturally expresses search spaces as functions f: Base to Decision, yielding
|Decision|^|Base| candidate relations. Third, we provide structure-preserving
translation semantics from solution sets to standard relational algebra,
enabling mechanical translation to existing evaluation algorithms. This
framework achieves the expressiveness of the most powerful prior approaches
while providing the theoretical clarity and compositional properties absent in
previous work. We demonstrate the capabilities these algebras open up through a
polymorphic SQL where standard clauses seamlessly express data management,
subset selection, and optimisation queries within a single paradigm.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了Multi-IaC-Bench基准数据集，用于评估LLM在AWS CloudFormation、Terraform和CDK等多种IaC格式上的代码生成和修改能力，发现LLM在语法正确性方面表现良好（>95%），但在语义对齐和复杂模式处理方面仍存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同云服务提供商使用不同的IaC格式，缺乏标准化要求云架构师掌握多种语言，增加了云部署复杂性。虽然LLM在自动化IaC创建和维护方面有潜力，但由于缺乏跨多种IaC格式的全面基准，进展受限。

Method: 通过合成数据生成管道创建包含初始IaC模板、自然语言修改请求和对应更新模板的三元组数据集，并进行了严格验证。评估了多个最先进的LLM，包括提示工程和重试机制的消融研究。

Result: 现代LLM在跨格式生成语法有效的IaC方面可以达到高成功率（>95%），但在语义对齐和处理复杂基础设施模式方面仍存在显著挑战。提示工程和重试机制对成功的IaC生成至关重要。

Conclusion: Multi-IaC-Bench基准的发布将促进AI辅助基础设施管理的进一步研究，并为这一关键领域建立标准化评估指标。

Abstract: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is fundamental to modern cloud computing,
enabling teams to define and manage infrastructure through machine-readable
configuration files. However, different cloud service providers utilize diverse
IaC formats. The lack of a standardized format requires cloud architects to be
proficient in multiple IaC languages, adding complexity to cloud deployment.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating IaC creation and
maintenance, progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks
across multiple IaC formats. We present Multi-IaC-Bench, a novel benchmark
dataset for evaluating LLM-based IaC generation and mutation across AWS
CloudFormation, Terraform, and Cloud Development Kit (CDK) formats. The dataset
consists of triplets containing initial IaC templates, natural language
modification requests, and corresponding updated templates, created through a
synthetic data generation pipeline with rigorous validation. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art LLMs on Multi-IaC-Bench, demonstrating that while
modern LLMs can achieve high success rates (>95%) in generating syntactically
valid IaC across formats, significant challenges remain in semantic alignment
and handling complex infrastructure patterns. Our ablation studies highlight
the importance of prompt engineering and retry mechanisms in successful IaC
generation. We release Multi-IaC-Bench to facilitate further research in
AI-assisted infrastructure management and establish standardized evaluation
metrics for this crucial domain.

*Edith Cohen,Moshe Shechner,Uri Stemmer*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文重新审视分布式计数问题，提出了一个简单且通信复杂度最优的鲁棒协议，解决了先前协议在自适应攻击下的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式计数问题中，确定性协议的通信复杂度为Θ(k/ε log N)，随机化协议可降至Θ(√k/ε log N)，但现有随机化协议仅限于非自适应场景。Xiong等人提出的鲁棒协议存在复杂度高和通信开销大的问题，需要探索简单且最优的鲁棒解决方案。

Method: 首先证明Huang等人的简单协议在自适应攻击下不鲁棒，然后提出一个新的简单鲁棒协议，该协议在自适应设置下达到最优通信复杂度O(√k/ε log N)。

Result: 成功构造了针对Huang等人协议的自适应攻击，证明其不鲁棒性；提出的新协议在通信复杂度和简单性方面都优于现有鲁棒协议，首次在自适应设置下匹配最优非自适应复杂度。

Conclusion: 解决了分布式计数鲁棒性的开放问题，证明了简单协议可能不鲁棒，同时提供了更简单且通信最优的鲁棒协议，为分布式计数问题提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We revisit the distributed counting problem, where a server must continuously
approximate the total number of events occurring across $k$ sites while
minimizing communication. The communication complexity of this problem is known
to be $\Theta(\frac{k}{\epsilon}\log N)$ for deterministic protocols. Huang,
Yi, and Zhang (2012) showed that randomization can reduce this to
$\Theta(\frac{\sqrt{k}}{\epsilon}\log N)$, but their analysis is restricted to
the {\em oblivious setting}, where the stream of events is independent of the
protocol's outputs.
  Xiong, Zhu, and Huang (2023) presented a robust protocol for distributed
counting that removes the oblivious assumption. However, their communication
complexity is suboptimal by a $polylog(k)$ factor and their protocol is
substantially more complex than the oblivious protocol of Huang et al. (2012).
This left open a natural question: could it be that the simple protocol of
Huang et al. (2012) is already robust?
  We resolve this question with two main contributions. First, we show that the
protocol of Huang et al. (2012) is itself not robust by constructing an
explicit adaptive attack that forces it to lose its accuracy. Second, we
present a new, surprisingly simple, robust protocol for distributed counting
that achieves the optimal communication complexity of
$O(\frac{\sqrt{k}}{\epsilon} \log N)$. Our protocol is simpler than that of
Xiong et al. (2023), perhaps even simpler than that of Huang et al. (2012), and
is the first to match the optimal oblivious complexity in the adaptive setting.

Motivation: 解决大规模向量搜索系统的扩展性问题，传统分区和路由策略效率不足，需要更高效的分布式向量搜索架构

Result: 在Bing搜索引擎中成功部署，实现26ms中位查询延迟，每秒处理10万+查询，效率提升6倍

Conclusion: DISTRIBUTEDANN证明了基于分布式键值存储和内存ANN索引的架构能够有效支持超大规模向量搜索，为搜索引擎等应用提供了高性能解决方案

Abstract: We present DISTRIBUTEDANN, a distributed vector search service that makes it
possible to search over a single 50 billion vector graph index spread across
over a thousand machines that offers 26ms median query latency and processes
over 100,000 queries per second. This is 6x more efficient than existing
partitioning and routing strategies that route the vector query to a subset of
partitions in a scale out vector search system. DISTRIBUTEDANN is built using
two well-understood components: a distributed key-value store and an in-memory
ANN index. DISTRIBUTEDANN has replaced conventional scale-out architectures for
serving the Bing search engine, and we share our experience from making this
transition.

Conclusion: 在非顶点传递图的敌对环境下，所提出的算法能够有效解决机器人聚集问题，为这类问题提供了完整的理论框架

Abstract: The Gathering problem for a swarm of robots asks for a distributed algorithm
that brings such entities to a common place, not known in advance. We consider
the well-known OBLOT model with robots constrained to move along the edges of a
graph, hence gathering in one vertex, eventually. Despite the classical setting
under which the problem has been usually approached, we consider the `hostile'
case where: i) the initial configuration may contain multiplicities, i.e. more
than one robot may occupy the same vertex; ii) robots cannot detect
multiplicities. As a scheduler for robot activation, we consider the
"favorable" round-robin case, where robots are activated one at a time.
  Our objective is to achieve a complete characterization of the problem in the
broad context of non-vertex-transitive graphs, i.e., graphs where the vertices
are partitioned into at least two different classes of equivalence. We provide
a resolution algorithm for any configuration of robots moving on such graphs,
along with its correctness. Furthermore, we analyze its time complexity.

Supporting control applications and distributed system operations by leveraging

flexibility, security, and fault tolerance without sacrificing
cost-effectiveness. Initial evaluation confirms the practical feasibility of
our approach, highlighting its potential to sustainably maintain and

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FineServe是一个用于混合精度大语言模型推理服务的框架，通过KV Slab内存管理和两级调度系统，解决了量化模型的内存碎片和调度效率问题，显著提升了服务质量和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化大语言模型虽然能提高吞吐量和减少内存使用，但存在KV缓存块大小较小导致内存碎片化的问题，同时量化与非量化模型的资源使用模式不同，需要高效的调度机制来最大化系统吞吐量。

Method: 提出了FineServe框架，包含两个关键技术：1) KV Slab - 基于模型量化特性的自适应内存管理技术，动态分配KV缓存；2) 两级调度框架 - 全局调度器根据请求率、延迟SLO和内存约束进行模型放置，本地调度器根据实时请求波动自适应调整批处理大小。

Result: 实验结果显示，FineServe相比最先进的GPU共享系统，实现了高达2.2倍的SLO达成率和1.8倍的token生成吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: FineServe通过创新的内存管理和调度机制，有效解决了混合精度LLM推理服务中的内存碎片和调度效率问题，显著提升了系统性能和服务质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques have
significantly increased demand for serving quantized large language models
(LLMs), enabling higher throughput and substantially reduced memory usage with
minimal accuracy loss. Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and
enhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However,
quantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing
limited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource
usage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient
scheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose
FineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's
key contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory
management technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model
quantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation,
and (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that
places models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory
constraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch
sizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results
demonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x
higher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing
systems.

TL;DR: MaaSO是一个面向MaaS平台的编排器，通过异构实例配置和智能请求分发，显著提升SLO满足率和降低延迟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理系统使用相同配置的实例，无法利用不同并行策略和批处理大小带来的性能差异来满足多样化的SLO需求

Method: 包含三个模块：性能分析器（分析不同配置下的实例性能）、配置优化器（优化异构实例配置）、分发器（SLO感知请求分发和预防级联超时）

Result: 相比现有方法，SLO满足率提升15-30%，响应延迟降低40-60%，编排开销显著降低

Conclusion: MaaSO通过利用LLM实例的异构配置能力，有效解决了MaaS平台中多样化SLO需求的挑战

Abstract: Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms face diverse Service Level Objective
(SLO) requirements stemming from various large language model (LLM)
applications, manifested in contextual complexity, first-token latency, and
between-token latency. On the other hand, an LLM instance, when configured with
different parallelism strategies and inference batch sizes, exhibits distinct
performance characteristics and can thus be used to serve different SLO
requirements. However, current LLM inference systems typically deploy instances
of the same model with identical configurations, lacking mechanisms to leverage
such heterogeneity. To fill this research gap, we propose MaaSO, the first MaaS
Orchestrator, which comprises three modules: (1) a profiler characterizing
instance performance under diverse parallelism strategies and inference batch
sizes; (2) a placer optimizing heterogeneous instance configurations; (3) a
distributor enabling SLO-aware request distribution and preventing cascaded
timeouts in continuous batching. Experiments show that MaaSO improves the SLO
satisfaction ratio by 15 to 30% and reduces response latency by 40 to 60%
compared to existing approaches, and significantly lowers overall orchestration
overhead.

TL;DR: 首个基于内存计算(PIM)的多服务器隐私信息检索(IM-PIR)方案，在UPMEM PIM平台上实现了查询吞吐量提升3.7倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前隐私信息检索(PIR)构造计算成本高，大部分实现是内存绑定的，需要扫描大量数据库，受限于传统处理器中心计算架构的内存带宽

Method: 利用内存计算(PIM)新兴计算范式，在UPMEM PIM商业化PIM架构上设计实现IM-PIR方案，利用PIM的高并行性和高内存带宽优势

Result: PIM基多服务器PIR实现使查询吞吐量显著提升，远超标准CPU基PIR方案，性能提升达3.7倍以上

Conclusion: PIM架构能够有效解决PIR的内存带宽瓶颈问题，为隐私信息检索提供了高效的计算平台，展示了PIM在数据密集工作负载中的巨大潜力

Abstract: Private information retrieval (PIR) is a cryptographic primitive that allows
a client to securely query one or multiple servers without revealing their
specific interests. In spite of their strong security guarantees, current PIR
constructions are computationally costly. Specifically, most PIR
implementations are memory-bound due to the need to scan extensive databases
(in the order of GB), making them inherently constrained by the limited memory
bandwidth in traditional processor-centric computing
architectures.Processing-in-memory (PIM) is an emerging computing paradigm that
augments memory with compute capabilities, addressing the memory bandwidth
bottleneck while simultaneously providing extensive parallelism.Recent research
has demonstrated PIM's potential to significantly improve performance across a
range of data-intensive workloads, including graph processing, genome analysis,
and machine learning.
  In this work, we propose the first PIM-based architecture for multi-server
PIR. We discuss the algorithmic foundations of the latter and show how its
operations align with the core strengths of PIM architectures: extensive
parallelism and high memory bandwidth. Based on this observation, we design and
implement IM-PIR, a PIM-based multi-server PIR approach on top of UPMEM PIM,
the first openly commercialized PIM architecture. Our evaluation demonstrates
that a PIM-based multi-server PIR implementation significantly improves query
throughput by more than 3.7x when compared to a standard CPU-based PIR
approach.

TL;DR: Mangrove是一种新颖的区块链扩展方法，通过为每个智能合约使用独立的共识实例来实现并行处理，无需全局排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统单体区块链中单一共识机制导致交易严格全局排序的性能瓶颈问题，实现更高的并行处理能力。

Method: 采用Parallel Optimistic Agreement机制确保并行实例运行时无冲突交易提交，对简单交易使用轻量级Byzantine Reliable Broadcast原语降低延迟。

Result: 在乐观条件下（无恶意行为且网络同步），协议可在创建和执行交易之间实现2个通信步骤的延迟。

Conclusion: Mangrove为构建支持并行智能合约的区块链提供了一种高效的扩展解决方案，在理想条件下显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Mangrove is a novel scaling approach to building blockchains with parallel
smart contract support. Unlike in monolithic blockchains, where a single
consensus mechanism determines a strict total order over all transactions,
Mangrove uses separate consensus instances per smart contract, without a global
order. To allow multiple instances to run in parallel while ensuring that no
conflicting transactions are committed, we propose a mechanism called Parallel
Optimistic Agreement. Additionally, for simple transactions, we leverage a
lightweight Byzantine Reliable Broadcast primitive to reduce latency. Mangrove
is optimized for performance under optimistic conditions, where there is no
misbehavior and the network is synchronous. Under these conditions, our
protocol can achieve a latency of 2 communication steps between creating and
executing a transaction.

Abstract: In wireless networks characterized by dense connectivity, the significant
signaling overhead generated by distributed link scheduling algorithms can
exacerbate issues like congestion, energy consumption, and radio footprint
expansion. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a distributed link
sparsification scheme employing graph neural networks (GNNs) to reduce
scheduling overhead for delay-tolerant traffic while maintaining network
capacity. A GNN module is trained to adjust contention thresholds for
individual links based on traffic statistics and network topology, enabling
links to withdraw from scheduling contention when they are unlikely to succeed.
Our approach is facilitated by a novel offline constrained {unsupervised}
learning algorithm capable of balancing two competing objectives: minimizing
scheduling overhead while ensuring that total utility meets the required level.
In simulated wireless multi-hop networks with up to 500 links, our link
sparsification technique effectively alleviates network congestion and reduces
radio footprints across four distinct distributed link scheduling protocols.

Motivation: 面向6G网络的多样化需求和日益增长的能耗，IAB网络需要在缓解基础设施复杂性的同时，通过优化路由和资源分配来满足性能要求并实现能源优化。

Method: 开发了一个新颖的容量模型，将功率水平与可实现数据速率相关联；提出两种实用的大规模优化方法，并利用O-RAN架构的闭环控制框架集成解决方案。

Conclusion: 结果验证了该框架在下一代IAB网络部署和优化中的实际应用性。

Abstract: As networks evolve towards 6G, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) must
accommodate diverse requirements and at the same time manage rising energy
consumption. Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) networks facilitate dense
cellular deployments with reduced infrastructure complexity. However, the
multi-hop wireless backhauling in IAB networks necessitates proper routing and
resource allocation decisions to meet the performance requirements. At the same
time, cell densification makes energy optimization crucial. This paper
addresses the joint optimization of routing and resource allocation in IAB
networks through two distinct objectives: energy minimization and throughput
maximization. We develop a novel capacity model that links power levels to
achievable data rates. We propose two practical large-scale approaches to solve
the optimization problems and leverage the closed-loop control framework
introduced by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture to integrate
the solutions. The approaches are evaluated on diverse scenarios built upon
open data of two months of traffic collected by network operators in the city
of Milan, Italy. Results show that the proposed approaches effectively reduces
number of activated nodes to save energy and achieves approximately 100 Mbps of
minimum data rate per User Equipment (UE) during peak hours of the day using
spectrum within the Frequency Range (FR) 3, or upper midband. The results
validate the practical applicability of our framework for next-generation IAB
network deployment and optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地理复制数据库在保持严格可串行化和高吞吐量的同时，难以实现低延迟的事务提交。Tiga旨在在大多数情况下实现1-WRTT延迟提交，同时最小化计算开销。

Method: Tiga整合并发控制和共识，使用同步时钟为每个事务分配未来时间戳进行主动排序。事务在到达服务器前就已按时间戳序列化，大多数情况下只需1-WRTT提交。少数延迟情况下回退到慢路径(1.5-2 WRTT)。

Result: 评估结果显示Tiga优于所有基线方法，吞吐量提高1.3-7.2倍，延迟降低1.4-4.6倍。大多数事务能在1-WRTT内提交，吞吐量开销显著减少。

Conclusion: Tiga通过创新的主动时间戳排序方法，成功实现了地理复制数据库的高吞吐量和低延迟事务处理，为分布式事务系统提供了新的设计思路，并已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents Tiga, a new design for geo-replicated and scalable
transactional databases such as Google Spanner. Tiga aims to commit
transactions within 1 wide-area roundtrip time, or 1 WRTT, for a wide range of
scenarios, while maintaining high throughput with minimal computational
overhead. Tiga consolidates concurrency control and consensus, completing both
strictly serializable execution and consistent replication in a single round.
It uses synchronized clocks to proactively order transactions by assigning each
a future timestamp at submission. In most cases, transactions arrive at servers
before their future timestamps and are serialized according to the designated
timestamp, requiring 1 WRTT to commit. In rare cases, transactions are delayed
and proactive ordering fails, in which case Tiga falls back to a slow path,
committing in 1.5--2 WRTTs. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, Tiga can
commit more transactions at 1-WRTT latency, and incurs much less throughput
overhead. Evaluation results show that Tiga outperforms all baselines,
achieving 1.3--7.2$\times$ higher throughput and 1.4--4.6$\times$ lower

*Mahsa Paknejad,Parisa Fard Moshiri,Murat Simsek,Burak Kantarci,Hussein T. Mouftah*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种在车辆网络中处理实时任务的在线动态成本驱动算法(On-Dyn-CDA)，在任务完成数量、延迟和计算效率方面都显著优于传统PSO算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车辆网络中实时任务处理面临低延迟和低任务投弃率的挑战，需要快速高效的任务执行策略来最大化完成任务数量并最小化总体延迟。

Method: 研究了静态和动态优化算法版本，分别处理全部可用任务和随机到达任务。提出了在线动态成本驱动算法(On-Dyn-CDA)，该算法在任务离线决策过程中考虑执行时间。

Result: On-Dyn-CDA在最复杂场景下仅需0.05秒完成执行，较动态PSO的1330.05秒显著提升。任务损失率优化3.42%，平均延迟降低29.22%。无需数据集和训练阶段，计算复杂度低。

Conclusion: 该算法在动态环境中具有高效性和可扩展性，适用于车辆网络的实时任务处理场景，在性能和计算效率方面都显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Real-time task processing is a critical challenge in vehicular networks,
where achieving low latency and minimizing dropped task ratio depend on
efficient task execution. Our primary objective is to maximize the number of
completed tasks while minimizing overall latency, with a particular focus on
reducing number of dropped tasks. To this end, we investigate both static and
dynamic versions of an optimization algorithm. The static version assumes full
task availability, while the dynamic version manages tasks as they arrive. We
also distinguish between online and offline cases: the online version
incorporates execution time into the offloading decision process, whereas the
offline version excludes it, serving as a theoretical benchmark for optimal
performance. We evaluate our proposed Online Dynamic Cost-Driven Algorithm
(On-Dyn-CDA) against these baselines. Notably, the static Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) baseline assumes all tasks are transferred to the RSU and
processed by the MEC, and its offline version disregards execution time, making
it infeasible for real-time applications despite its optimal performance in
theory. Our novel On-Dyn-CDA completes execution in just 0.05 seconds under the
most complex scenario, compared to 1330.05 seconds required by Dynamic PSO. It
also outperforms Dynamic PSO by 3.42% in task loss and achieves a 29.22%
reduction in average latency in complex scenarios. Furthermore, it requires
neither a dataset nor a training phase, and its low computational complexity
ensures efficiency and scalability in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: ALPHA是首个无人工干预的主动学习日志分析管道，通过语义嵌入、聚类采样和LLM辅助少样本标注实现自动化异常检测，减少人工标注需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统日志分析方法依赖专家知识或全监督学习，需要大量标注数据和人工努力，亟需自动化解决方案

Method: 集成语义嵌入、聚类代表性采样、LLM辅助少样本标注，采用两步少样本精炼策略自适应选择提示，通过标签传播实现大规模训练

Result: 在真实日志数据集上实验表明，ALPHA达到与全监督方法相当的检测精度，同时显著减少人工参与

Conclusion: ALPHA为真正自动化的日志异常检测提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案，支持LLM驱动的可解释根因分析

Abstract: Network log data analysis plays a critical role in detecting security threats
and operational anomalies. Traditional log analysis methods for anomaly
detection and root cause analysis rely heavily on expert knowledge or fully
supervised learning models, both of which require extensive labeled data and
significant human effort. To address these challenges, we propose ALPHA, the
first Active Learning Pipeline for Human-free log Analysis. ALPHA integrates
semantic embedding, clustering-based representative sampling, and large
language model (LLM)-assisted few-shot annotation to automate the anomaly
detection process. The LLM annotated labels are propagated across clusters,
enabling large-scale training of an anomaly detector with minimal supervision.
To enhance the annotation accuracy, we propose a two-step few-shot refinement
strategy that adaptively selects informative prompts based on the LLM's
observed error patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world log datasets
demonstrate that ALPHA achieves detection accuracy comparable to fully
supervised methods while mitigating human efforts in the loop. ALPHA also
supports interpretable analysis through LLM-driven root cause explanations in
the post-detection stage. These capabilities make ALPHA a scalable and
cost-efficient solution for truly automated log-based anomaly detection.

*Alissa Baumeister,Sina Keshvadi*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文通过公理化分析量化了路径感知网络中贪婪策略与协作策略之间的权衡，发现混合策略（如Epsilon-Greedy）能在高竞争场景中实现最高效率同时缓解网络不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路径感知网络架构（如SCION）和多路径传输协议（如MPTCP、MPQUIC）的结合虽然能提升性能和策略执行，但带来了个体性能优化与整体网络稳定性之间的显著权衡。

Method: 采用公理化分析方法，在模拟的路径感知环境中评估了从贪婪（Min-RTT）、协作（Round-Robin）到混合方法（Epsilon-Greedy）的一系列算法，针对效率、丢包避免、稳定性和公平性等公理进行评估。

Result: 纯粹贪婪策略在低竞争时高效，但随着竞争代理数量增加会导致灾难性丢包（增加超过18,000%）；协作策略确保公平稳定但无法充分利用高容量路径；混合策略（如Epsilon-Greedy）在高竞争场景中实现最高效率同时缓解不稳定性。

Conclusion: 可调节的混合算法对于设计下一代网络的鲁棒高性能路径选择机制至关重要。

Abstract: Path-aware networking architectures like SCION provide end-hosts with
explicit control over inter-domain routing, while multipath transport protocols
like MPTCP and MPQUIC enable the concurrent use of multiple paths. This
combination promises significant gains in performance and policy enforcement,
but it also creates a stark trade-off between individual performance
optimization and overall network stability. This paper quantifies this
trade-off through a rigorous axiomatic analysis. We evaluate a spectrum of
algorithms, from greedy (Min-RTT) and cooperative (Round-Robin) to hybrid
approaches (Epsilon-Greedy), against axioms of Efficiency, Loss Avoidance,
Stability, and Fairness in a simulated path-aware environment.
  Our simulations reveal that purely greedy strategies, while efficient under
low contention, induce catastrophic packet loss, increasing by over >18,000% as
the number of competing agents grow, due to herd effects that cause severe
network instability. Conversely, cooperative strategies ensure fairness and
stability but at the cost of underutilizing high-capacity paths. Crucially, we
demonstrate that hybrid strategies resolve this conflict. The Epsilon-Greedy
algorithm, for instance, achieves the highest efficiency of all tested
strategies in high-contention scenarios while mitigating the instability
inherent to the greedy approach. Our axiomatic analysis suggests that tunable,
hybrid algorithms are essential for designing robust and high-performance path
selection mechanisms for next-generation networks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement toward sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks has
significantly intensified the complexity and scale of optimization problems,
including resource allocation and trajectory design, often formulated as
combinatorial problems in large discrete decision spaces. However, traditional
optimization methods, such as heuristics and deep reinforcement learning (DRL),
struggle to meet the demanding requirements of real-time adaptability,
scalability, and dynamic handling of user intents in increasingly heterogeneous
and resource-constrained network environments. Large language models (LLMs)
present a transformative paradigm by enabling natural language-driven problem
formulation, context-aware reasoning, and adaptive solution refinement through
advanced semantic understanding and structured reasoning capabilities. This
paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of LLM-enabled
optimization frameworks tailored for wireless networks. We first introduce
foundational design concepts and distinguish LLM-enabled methods from
conventional optimization paradigms. Subsequently, we critically analyze key
enabling methodologies, including natural language modeling, solver
collaboration, and solution verification processes. Moreover, we explore
representative case studies to demonstrate LLMs' transformative potential in
practical scenarios such as optimization formulation, low-altitude economy
networking, and intent networking. Finally, we discuss current research
challenges, examine prominent open-source frameworks and datasets, and identify
promising future directions to facilitate robust, scalable, and trustworthy
LLM-enabled optimization solutions for next-generation wireless networks.

Conclusion: 通过分布式计算方案，可以在保持推理性能的同时有效减轻用户设备的计算负担，为移动网络支持高要求服务提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: With mobile networks expected to support services with stringent requirements
that ensure high-quality user experience, the ability to apply Feed-Forward
Neural Network (FFNN) models to User Equipment (UE) use cases has become
critical. Given that UEs have limited resources, running FFNNs directly on UEs
is an intrinsically challenging problem. This letter proposes an optimization
framework for split computing applications where an FFNN model is partitioned
into multiple sections, and executed by UEs, edge- and core-located nodes to
reduce the required UE computational footprint while containing the inference
time. An efficient heuristic strategy for solving the optimization problem is
also provided. The proposed framework is shown to be robust in heterogeneous
settings, eliminating the need for retraining and reducing the UE's memory
(CPU) footprint by over 33.6% (60%).

Result: 揭示了网络性能(特别是包接收率PRR)与控制精度之间的相关性

Conclusion: 该仿真框架能够有效模拟和可视化通信与控制之间的复杂交互，为联合通信与控制(JCC)研究提供了有力工具

Abstract: Networked Control System (NCS) is a paradigm where sensors, controllers, and
actuators communicate over a shared network. One promising application of NCS
is the control of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in the industrial
environment, for example to transport goods efficiently and to autonomously
follow predefined paths or routes. In this context, communication and control
are tightly correlated, a paradigm referred to as Joint Communication and
Control (JCC), since network issues such as delays or errors can lead to
significant deviations of the AGVs from the planned trajectory. In this paper,
we present a simulation framework based on Gazebo and Robot Operating System 2
(ROS 2) to simulate and visualize, respectively, the complex interaction
between the control of AGVs and the underlying communication network. This
framework explicitly incorporates communication metrics, such as delay and
packet loss, and control metrics, especially the Mean Squared Error (MSE)
between the optimal/desired and actual path of the AGV in response to driving
commands. Our results shed light into the correlation between the network
performance, particularly Packet Reception Ratio (PRR), and accuracy of
control.

Motivation: 5G-TSN网络中存在振荡和非对称延迟问题，虽然透明钛钛是有前景的解决方案，但缺乏实验验证，需要实际评估其在商业设备上的表现

Method: 在商业TSN开关上实现单钛钛的5G端到端透明钛钛，计算5G中的居留时间并在从节点恢复钛钛域，通过修改PTP消息传输速率进行同步评估

Result: 实验结果显示峰峰同步精度达到500纳秒，满足工业要求的<1微秒，对于特定PTP消息传输速率可实现最小同步偏差

Conclusion: 透明钛钛在TSN-5G网络中可以实现高精度时间同步，满足工业应用的严格要求，为工业IoT和产业4.0/5.0提供了可靠的时间同步解决方案

Abstract: Time synchronization is essential for industrial IoT and Industry 4.0/5.0
applications, but achieving high synchronization accuracy in Time-Sensitive
Networking (TSN)-5G networks is challenging due to jitter and asymmetric
delays. 3GPP TS 23.501 defines three 5G synchronization modes: time-aware
system, boundary clock (BC), and transparent clock (TC), where TC offers a
promising solution. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no
empirical evaluation of TC in a TSN-5G network. This paper empirically
evaluates an 5G end-to-end TC in a TSN-5G network, implemented on commercial
TSN switches with a single clock. For TC development, we compute the residence
time in 5G and recover the clock domain at the slave node. We deploy a TSN-5G
testbed with commercial equipment for synchronization evaluation by modifying
the Precision Timing Protocol (PTP) message transmission rates. Experimental
results show a peak-to-peak synchronization of 500 ns, meeting the industrial
requirement of < 1 us, with minimal synchronization offsets for specific PTP
message transmission rates.

Abstract: The Internet, the world's largest and most pervasive network, lacks a
transparent, granular view of its traffic patterns, volumes, and growth trends,
hindering the networking community's understanding of its dynamics. This paper
leverages publicly available Internet Exchange Point traffic statistics to
address this gap, presenting a comprehensive two-year study (2023-2024) from

event-driven anomalies, and demonstrates stable utilization rates, reflecting
predictable infrastructure scaling. By analyzing biases and confirming high
self-similarity, we establish IXP traffic as a robust proxy for overall
Internet growth and usage behavior. With transparent, replicable data--covering
87% of the worldwide IXP port capacity--and plans to release our dataset, this

Motivation: 隧道车辆检测对交通监控和事故响应至关重要，但现有研究较少。主要挑战是处理多路径反射产生的幽灵点，这些点会导致严重的定位误差和误报。

Method: 提出多路径射线追踪算法，利用地面平面约束和信号路径损耗识别最可能的反射路径；引入曲线到平面分割方法简化隧道表面建模，降低计算延迟实现实时处理。

Conclusion: mmTunnel系统通过校正而非简单移除幽灵点，有效提升了隧道车辆检测性能，在复杂场景下保持高精度和实时性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Vehicle detection in tunnels is crucial for traffic monitoring and accident
response, yet remains underexplored. In this paper, we develop mmTunnel, a
millimeter-wave radar system that achieves far-range vehicle detection in
tunnels. The main challenge here is coping with ghost points caused by
multi-path reflections, which lead to severe localization errors and false
alarms. Instead of merely removing ghost points, we propose correcting them to
true vehicle positions by recovering their signal reflection paths, thus
reserving more data points and improving detection performance, even in
occlusion scenarios. However, recovering complex 3D reflection paths from
limited 2D radar points is highly challenging. To address this problem, we
develop a multi-path ray tracing algorithm that leverages the ground plane
constraint and identifies the most probable reflection path based on signal
path loss and spatial distance. We also introduce a curve-to-plane segmentation
method to simplify tunnel surface modeling such that we can significantly
reduce the computational delay and achieve real-time processing.
  We have evaluated mmTunnel with comprehensive experiments. In two test
tunnels, we conducted controlled experiments in various scenarios with cars and
trucks. Our system achieves an average F1 score of 93.7% for vehicle detection
while maintaining real-time processing. Even in the challenging occlusion
scenarios, the F1 score remains above 91%. Moreover, we collected extensive
data from a public tunnel with heavy traffic at times and show our method could
achieve an F1 score of 91.5% in real-world traffic conditions.

Abstract: The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Large Language
Models (LLMs), and Large Telecom Models (LTM) significantly reshapes mobile
networks, especially as the telecom industry transitions from 5G's
cloud-centric to AI-native 6G architectures. This transition unlocks
unprecedented capabilities in real-time automation, semantic networking, and
autonomous service orchestration. However, it introduces critical risks related
to data sovereignty, security, explainability, and regulatory compliance
especially when AI models are trained, deployed, or governed externally. This
paper introduces the concept of `Sovereign AI' as a strategic imperative for
6G, proposing architectural, operational, and governance frameworks that enable
national or operator-level control over AI development, deployment, and
life-cycle management. Focusing on O-RAN architecture, we explore how sovereign
AI-based xApps and rApps can be deployed Near-RT and Non-RT RICs to ensure
policy-aligned control, secure model updates, and federated learning across
trusted infrastructure. We analyse global strategies, technical enablers, and
challenges across safety, talent, and model governance. Our findings underscore
that Sovereign AI is not just a regulatory necessity but a foundational pillar
for secure, resilient, and ethically-aligned 6G networks.

Conclusion: VariSAC能够在高度动态的车辆环境中实现持久连接，为RIS辅助的ISAC车辆网络提供了有效的可靠性保障解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and Integrated
Sensing and Communication (ISAC) in vehicular networks enables dynamic spatial
resource management and real-time adaptation to environmental changes. However,
the coexistence of distinct vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity requirements, together with highly
dynamic and heterogeneous network topologies, presents significant challenges
for unified reliability modeling and resource optimization. To address these
issues, we propose VariSAC, a graph neural network (GNN)-augmented deep
reinforcement learning framework for assured, time-continuous connectivity in
RIS-assisted, ISAC-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems. Specifically,
we introduce the Continuous Connectivity Ratio (CCR), a unified metric that
characterizes the sustained temporal reliability of V2I connections and the
probabilistic delivery guarantees of V2V links, thus unifying their continuous
reliability semantics. Next, we employ a GNN with residual adapters to encode
complex, high-dimensional system states, capturing spatial dependencies among
vehicles, base stations (BS), and RIS nodes. These representations are then
processed by a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent, which jointly optimizes channel
allocation, power control, and RIS configurations to maximize CCR-driven
long-term rewards. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets
demonstrate that VariSAC consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms
of continuous V2I ISAC connectivity and V2V delivery reliability, enabling
persistent connectivity in highly dynamic vehicular environments.

Abstract: Mega-satellite constellations have the potential to leverage inter-satellite
links to deliver low-latency end-to-end communication services globally,
thereby extending connectivity to underserved regions. However, harsh space
environments make satellites vulnerable to failures, leading to node removals
that disrupt inter-satellite networking. With the high risk of satellite node
failures, understanding their impact on end-to-end services is essential. This
study investigates the importance of individual nodes on inter-satellite
networking and the resilience of mega satellite constellations against node
failures. We represent the mega-satellite constellation as discrete temporal
graphs and model node failure events accordingly. To quantify node importance
for targeted services over time, we propose a service-aware temporal
betweenness metric. Leveraging this metric, we develop an analytical framework
to identify critical nodes and assess the impact of node failures. The
framework takes node failure events as input and efficiently evaluates their
impacts across current and subsequent time windows. Simulations on the Starlink
constellation setting reveal that satellite networks inherently exhibit
resilience to node failures, as their dynamic topology partially restore
connectivity and mitigate the long-term impact. Furthermore, we find that the
integration of rerouting mechanisms is crucial for unleashing the full
resilience potential to ensure rapid recovery of inter-satellite networking.

*Zhihui Gao,Zhecun Liu,Tingjun Chen*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: BatStation是一个轻量级雷达感知框架，集成到5G基站中，利用上行资源网格提取雷达信号，实现雷达检测、分类和定位，无需实验数据微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 在真实5G流量测试中，检测概率达97.02%(PUCCH)和79.23%(PUSCH)，分类准确率最高97.00%，定位误差频率2.68-6.20MHz、时间24.6-32.4微秒，运行时延仅0.11/0.94ms(GPU/CPU)。

Conclusion: BatStation成功实现了轻量级、实时的雷达感知解决方案，满足5G网络实时要求，为雷达与5G频谱共享提供了有效技术途径。

Abstract: The coexistence between incumbent radar signals and commercial 5G signals
necessitates a versatile and ubiquitous radar sensing for efficient and
adaptive spectrum sharing. In this context, leveraging the densely deployed 5G
base stations (BS) for radar sensing is particularly promising, offering both
wide coverage and immediate feedback to 5G scheduling. However, the targeting
radar signals are superimposed with concurrent 5G uplink transmissions received
by the BS, and practical deployment also demands a lightweight, portable radar
sensing model. This paper presents BatStation, a lightweight, in-situ radar
sensing framework seamlessly integrated into 5G BSs. BatStation leverages
uplink resource grids to extract radar signals through three key components:
(i) radar signal separation to cancel concurrent 5G transmissions and reveal
the radar signals, (ii) resource grid reshaping to align time-frequency
resolution with radar pulse characteristics, and (iii) zero-shot template
correlation based on a portable model trained purely on synthetic data that
supports detection, classification, and localization of radar pulses without
fine-tuning using experimental data. We implement BatStation on a
software-defined radio (SDR) testbed and evaluate its performance with real 5G
traffic in the CBRS band. Results show robust performance across diverse radar
types, achieving detection probabilities of 97.02% (PUCCH) and 79.23% (PUSCH),
classification accuracy up to 97.00%, and median localization errors of
2.68-6.20 MHz (frequency) and 24.6-32.4 microseconds (time). Notably,
BatStation achieves this performance with a runtime latency of only 0.11/0.94
ms on GPU/CPU, meeting the real-time requirement of 5G networks.

### [311] [Comparing Methods for the Cross-Level Verification of SystemC Peripherals with Symbolic Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05504)
*Karl Aaron Rudkowski,Sallar Ahmadi-Pour,Rolf Drechsler*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了CrosSym和SEFOS两种符号执行方法，用于虚拟原型中外设的验证。CrosSym修改SystemC内核，SEFOS修改符号执行引擎，两者都能实现跨抽象层级的验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代硬件开发中，虚拟原型(VP)是重要工具，但现有符号执行方法要么需要修改SystemC内核，要么无法处理跨层级场景，特别是外设子系统的特殊验证挑战。

Method: CrosSym：修改SystemC内核来实现符号执行；SEFOS：修改现代符号执行引擎来支持SystemC虚拟原型。两种方法都支持外设的跨抽象层级符号执行验证。

Result: 两种工具都能处理不同验证场景并识别300+变异体。SEFOS优势在于无需修改SystemC内核和外设，CrosSym在运行时间和内存使用上稍优。与现有TLM方法相比，运行时间相当但支持跨层级验证。

Conclusion: CrosSym和SEFOS提供了灵活的外设符号执行验证方案，SEFOS更适合保持系统原样的场景，CrosSym在性能上略有优势，两者都比现有TLM方法更具灵活性。

Abstract: Virtual Prototypes (VPs) are important tools in modern hardware development.
At high abstractions, they are often implemented in SystemC and offer early
analysis of increasingly complex designs. These complex designs often combine
one or more processors, interconnects, and peripherals to perform tasks in
hardware or interact with the environment. Verifying these subsystems is a
well-suited task for VPs, as they allow reasoning across different abstraction
levels. While modern verification techniques like symbolic execution can be
seamlessly integrated into VP-based workflows, they require modifications in
the SystemC kernel. Hence, existing approaches therefore modify and replace the
SystemC kernel, or ignore the opportunity of cross-level scenarios completely,
and would not allow focusing on special challenges of particular subsystems
like peripherals. We propose CrosSym and SEFOS, two opposing approaches for a
versatile symbolic execution of peripherals. CrosSym modifies the SystemC
kernel, while SEFOS instead modifies a modern symbolic execution engine. Our
extensive evaluation applies our tools to various peripherals on different
levels of abstractions. Both tools extensive sets of features are demonstrated
for (1) different verification scenarios, and (2) identifying 300+ mutants. In
comparison with each other, SEFOS convinces with the unmodified SystemC kernel
and peripheral, while CrosSym offers slightly better runtime and memory usage.
In comparison to the state-of-the-art, that is limited to Transaction Level
Modelling (TLM), our tools offered comparable runtime, while enabling
cross-level verification with symbolic execution.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对并发数据结构线性化验证的固定参数可处理算法，针对栈、队列和字谜无关数据类型(AADT)，参数化为最大并发度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并发数据结构的线性化验证即使在简单类型下也是NP难问题，需要开发高效的验证算法来应对实际应用中的并发场景。

Method: 利用前沿图和分区状态来限制搜索空间。对于AADT使用线性化等价性实现对数线性时间监控；对于栈采用基于语法的方法并简化为矩阵乘法；对于队列使用分割序列转换系统支持高效动态规划。

Result: 开发了针对栈、队列和AADT的固定参数可处理算法，在有限并发度下实现了高效的线性化验证。

Conclusion: 这些结果统一了在有界并发下对顺序敏感和字谜无关数据类型的可处理性保证，为并发数据结构的验证提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Verifying linearizability of concurrent data structures is NP-hard, even for
simple types. We present fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for monitoring
stacks, queues, and anagram-agnostic data types (AADTs), parameterized by the
maximum concurrency. Our approach leverages frontier graphs and partition
states to bound the search space. For AADTs, equivalence of linearizations
enables monitoring in log-linear time. For stacks, we introduce a grammar-based
method with a sub-cubic reduction to matrix multiplication, and for queues, a
split-sequence transition system supporting efficient dynamic programming.
These results unify tractability guarantees for both order-sensitive and
anagram-agnostic data types under bounded concurrency.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的类型系统（pacing types）来确保异步数据流监控器的运行时安全性，以解决数据流异步性带来的潜在错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控器作为安全关键组件必须避免运行时错误，而异步数据流的同步问题容易导致细微的运行时错误。

Method: 设计并实现了pacing types类型系统，对RTLola核心模块进行形式化，并使用新的逻辑关系进行声音性证明。

Result: 形式化了pacing types的核心概念，并完成了类型系统的声音性证明。

Conclusion: pacing types类型系统能够有效确保异步数据流监控器的运行时安全性，为流基监控框架提供了可靠的类型安全保障。

Abstract: Stream-based monitoring is a real-time safety assurance mechanism for complex
cyber-physical systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles. In this context, a
monitor aggregates streams of input data from sensors and other sources to give
real-time statistics and assessments of the system's health. Since monitors are
safety-critical components, it is crucial to ensure that they are free of
potential runtime errors. One of the central challenges in designing reliable
stream-based monitors is to deal with the asynchronous nature of data streams:
in concrete applications, the different sensors being monitored produce values
at different speeds, and it is the monitor's responsibility to correctly react
to the asynchronous arrival of different streams of values. To ease this
process, modern frameworks for stream-based monitoring such as RTLola feature
an expressive specification language that allows to finely specify data
synchronization policies. While this feature dramatically simplifies the design
of monitors, it can also lead to subtle runtime errors. To mitigate this issue,
this paper presents pacing types, a novel type system implemented in RTLola to
ensure that monitors for asynchronous streams are well-behaved at runtime. We
formalize the essence of pacing types for a core fragment of RTLola, and
present a soundness proof of the pacing type system using a new logical
relation.

TL;DR: 这是一份关于带数值变量和线性约束转换程序的终止性分析的综述性论文，系统性探讨了应对该领域不可判定性挑战的各种方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序终止性分析是程序分析领域的重要议题，特别是对于包含数值变量和线性约束转换的程序，存在不可判定性问题，需要系统性的方法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 论文采用综述性方法，包括：基础性可判定性结果、排名函数的使用、分离良基转换不变量、以及用于证明程序不会停止的非终止性证据。

Result: 论文展示了不同方法在表达能力和计算复杂度之间的权衡关系，分析了这些方法的算法特性和复杂性方面。

Conclusion: 该综述性论文为线性约束程序的终止性分析领域提供了系统性的概述，但并未涵盖实际编程语言的终止性分析，以及非线性算术、概率选择或项重写系统等更复杂的抽象模型。

Abstract: This Survey provides an overview of techniques in termination analysis for
programs with numerical variables and transitions defined by linear
constraints. This subarea of program analysis is challenging due to the
existence of undecidable problems, and this Survey systematically explores
approaches that mitigate this inherent difficulty. These include foundational
decidability results, the use of ranking functions, and disjunctive
well-founded transition invariants. The Survey also discusses non-termination
witnesses, used to prove that a program will not halt. We examine the
algorithmic and complexity aspects of these methods, showing how different
approaches offer a trade-off between expressive power and computational
complexity. The Survey does not discuss how termination analysis is performed
on real-world programming languages, nor does it consider more expressive
abstract models that include non-linear arithmetic, probabilistic choice, or
term rewriting systems.

*Shihan Fang,Hongzheng Chen,Niansong Zhang,Jiajie Li,Han Meng,Adrian Liu,Zhiru Zhang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Dato是一个用于数据流加速器的Python嵌入式任务编程模型，通过将数据通信和分片作为一等类型构造，简化了高性能代码开发，在NPU和FPGA上均实现了接近理论峰值的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习工作负载对计算需求日益增长，但现有内存系统无法满足，许多内核因数据移动而非计算而停滞。现有编程模型难以有效利用数据流加速器的片上流处理能力，低层接口开发成本高，高层语言又抽象过度限制了优化。

Method: 提出Dato编程模型，将数据通信和分片作为一等类型构造。开发者通过显式流类型连接任务图，使用布局类型指定分片输入。任务首先虚拟映射到加速器空间结构，编译器随后生成符合硬件约束的物理映射。

Result: 在AMD Ryzen AI NPU上，Dato实现了GEMM高达84%的硬件利用率，注意力核函数相比最先进商业框架获得2.81倍加速。在FPGA上，Dato在生成定制脉动阵列时性能超越领先框架，达到理论峰值性能的98%。

Conclusion: Dato编程模型能够显著降低编写优化代码的负担，同时在数据流加速器上实现高性能，为现代深度学习工作负载提供了有效的编程解决方案。

Abstract: Recent deep learning workloads increasingly push computational demand beyond
what current memory systems can sustain, with many kernels stalling on data
movement rather than computation. While modern dataflow accelerators
incorporate on-chip streaming to mitigate off-chip bandwidth limitations,
existing programming models struggle to harness these capabilities effectively.
Low-level interfaces provide fine-grained control but impose significant
development overhead, whereas high-level tile-based languages abstract away
communication details, restricting optimization and forcing compilers to
reconstruct the intended dataflow. We present Dato, a Python-embedded,
task-based programming model for dataflow accelerators that elevates data
communication and sharding to first-class type constructs. Developers write
programs as a graph of tasks connected via explicit stream types, with sharded
inputs specified using layout types. These tasks are first mapped virtually
onto the accelerator's spatial fabric, and the compiler then generates a
physical mapping that respects hardware constraints. Experimental results on
both AMD Ryzen AI NPU and Alveo FPGA devices demonstrate that Dato achieves
high performance while significantly reducing the burden of writing optimized
code. On the NPU, Dato attains up to 84% hardware utilization for GEMM and
delivers a 2.81x speedup on attention kernels compared to a state-of-the-art
commercial framework. On the FPGA, Dato surpasses leading frameworks in
performance when generating custom systolic arrays, achieving 98% of the
theoretical peak performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多宇宙调试方法MIO，解决微控制器上非确定性程序调试中输入/输出操作导致的无法访问程序状态问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多宇宙调试器在处理输入/输出操作时会揭示无法进入的程序状态，这会很大程序干扰调试过程，甚至导致程序员误判代码存在错误。

Method: 设计了一种新的多宇宙调试方法，能够支持广泛的输入/输出操作。提供了形式语义学定义并证明了调试器的正确性。开发了MIO原型，基于WARDuino WebAssembly虚拟机实现。

Result: 证明了该方法的可行性和效率，确保调试器只会探索在正常执行中可达到的程序状态。通过Lego Mindstorms颜色调节器案例展示了在STM32微控制器上的应用效果。

Conclusion: MIO方法有效解决了多宇宙调试中输入/输出操作导致的无法访问状态问题，提供了一种可靠且高效的调试方案，特别适用于微控制器环境下的非确定性程序调试。

Abstract: Debugging non-deterministic programs on microcontrollers is notoriously
challenging, especially when bugs manifest in unpredictable, input-dependent
execution paths. A recent approach, called multiverse debugging, makes it
easier to debug non-deterministic programs by allowing programmers to explore
all potential execution paths. Current multiverse debuggers enable both forward
and backward traversal of program paths, and some facilitate jumping to any
previously visited states, potentially branching into alternative execution
paths within the state space.
  Unfortunately, debugging programs that involve input/output operations using
existing multiverse debuggers can reveal inaccessible program states, i.e.
states which are not encountered during regular execution. This can
significantly hinder the debugging process, as the programmer may spend
substantial time exploring and examining inaccessible program states, or worse,
may mistakenly assume a bug is present in the code, when in fact, the issue is
caused by the debugger.
  This paper presents a novel approach to multiverse debugging, which can
accommodate a broad spectrum of input/output operations. We provide the
semantics of our approach and prove the correctness of our debugger, ensuring
that despite having support for a wide range of input/output operations the
debugger will only explore those program states which can be reached during
regular execution.
  We have developed a prototype, called MIO, leveraging the WARDuino
WebAssembly virtual machine to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of
our techniques. As a demonstration of the approach we highlight a color dial
built with a Lego Mindstorms motor, and color sensor, providing a tangible
example of how our approach enables multiverse debugging for programs running
on an STM32 microcontroller.

Motivation: 虽然Jayanti等人提出了第一个声明完备的前向推理线性化证明技术，但其重要的元理论结果仍缺少机械化验证，无法生成验证的端到端证明

Method: 在Rocq中形式化这种前向推理技术，并机械化其声明性和完备性证明

Result: 实现了该技术的形式化验证，并通过简单并发寄存器案例完成了端到端的线性化验证证明

Conclusion: 通过形式化验证前向推理技术，减小了可信计算基础的规模，为生成验证的并发数据结构线性化证明提供了支持

Abstract: In the past decade, many techniques have been developed to prove
linearizability, the gold standard of correctness for concurrent data
structures. Intuitively, linearizability requires that every operation on a
concurrent data structure appears to take place instantaneously, even when
interleaved with other operations. Most recently, Jayanti et al. presented the
first sound and complete "forward reasoning" technique for proving
linearizability that relates the behavior of a concurrent data structure to a
reference atomic data structure as time moves forward. This technique can be
used to produce machine-checked proofs of linearizability in TLA+. However,
while Jayanti et al.'s approach is shown to be sound and complete, a
mechanization of this important metatheoretic result is still outstanding. As a
result, it is not possible to produce verified end-to-end proofs of
linearizability. To reduce the size of this trusted computing base, we
formalize this forward reasoning technique and mechanize proofs of its
soundness and completeness in Rocq. As a case study, we use the approach to
produce a verified end-to-end proof of linearizability for a simple concurrent
register.

*Piotr Przymus,Andreas Happe,Jürgen Cito*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现基于LLM的自动程序修复系统存在安全风险，对抗性bug报告可诱导系统生成不安全代码，现有防御措施效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM驱动的自动程序修复系统在软件开发中的广泛应用，依赖不可信用户输入引入了新的攻击面，需要研究对抗性bug报告带来的安全风险。

Method: 建立全面的威胁模型，通过51个对抗性bug报告（从手动制作到全自动流水线生成）测试主流APR系统，评估预修复防御和后修复检测机制的效果。

Result: 当前防御措施不足：90%的对抗性bug报告成功诱导攻击者期望的补丁，最佳预修复过滤器仅阻止47%，后修复分析在58%的情况下有效但需要人工监督。

Conclusion: 生成对抗性输入成本低廉而检测成本高昂，需要改进APR系统的鲁棒性，并提出可信自动修复的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) - based Automated Program Repair (APR) systems are
increasingly integrated into modern software development workflows, offering
automated patches in response to natural language bug reports. However, this
reliance on untrusted user input introduces a novel and underexplored attack
surface. In this paper, we investigate the security risks posed by adversarial
bug reports -- realistic-looking issue submissions crafted to mislead APR
systems into producing insecure or harmful code changes. We develop a
comprehensive threat model and conduct an empirical study to evaluate the
vulnerability of state-of-the-art APR systems to such attacks. Our
demonstration comprises 51 adversarial bug reports generated across a spectrum
of strategies, from manual curation to fully automated pipelines. We test these
against leading APR model and assess both pre-repair defenses (e.g., LlamaGuard
variants, PromptGuard variants, Granite-Guardian, and custom LLM filters) and
post-repair detectors (GitHub Copilot, CodeQL). Our findings show that current
defenses are insufficient: 90\% of crafted bug reports triggered
attacker-aligned patches. The best pre-repair filter blocked only 47\%, while
post-repair analysis-often requiring human oversight-was effective in just 58\%
of cases. To support scalable security testing, we introduce a prototype
framework for automating the generation of adversarial bug reports. Our
analysis exposes a structural asymmetry: generating adversarial inputs is
inexpensive, while detecting or mitigating them remains costly and error-prone.
We conclude with practical recommendations for improving the robustness of APR
systems against adversarial misuse and highlight directions for future work on
trustworthy automated repair.

differently: I use vector images instead of bitmaps as model input. I create
several large datasets for training machine learning models. I evaluate the
available array of Image Quality Assessment (IQA) algorithms and introduce a
new, multi-scale metric. I then train a large open-weights model and discuss
its limitations.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RestTSLLM使用测试规范语言和大语言模型自动生成REST API测试用例，解决了测试场景创建和输入数据定义两大核心挑战。评估显示Claude 3.5 Sonnet在各项指标上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: REST API测试面临分布式系统复杂性、多场景可能性和有限测试设计时间的挑战，传统方法难以穷尽所有输入组合，导致未检测故障、高人工成本和有限测试覆盖率。

Method: 结合测试规范语言和大语言模型，通过提示工程技术和自动化流水线，从OpenAPI规范自动生成测试用例，评估不同LLM在成功率、测试覆盖率和变异分数等指标上的表现。

Result: 表现最佳的LLM包括Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Deepseek R1、Qwen 2.5 32b和Sabia 3，其中Claude 3.5 Sonnet在所有指标上都优于其他模型。

Conclusion: LLM具有基于API规范自动生成测试的潜力，Claude 3.5 Sonnet被证明是最适合此任务的模型。

Abstract: The effective execution of tests for REST APIs remains a considerable
challenge for development teams, driven by the inherent complexity of
distributed systems, the multitude of possible scenarios, and the limited time
available for test design. Exhaustive testing of all input combinations is
impractical, often resulting in undetected failures, high manual effort, and
limited test coverage. To address these issues, we introduce RestTSLLM, an
approach that uses Test Specification Language (TSL) in conjunction with Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test cases for REST APIs.
The approach targets two core challenges: the creation of test scenarios and
the definition of appropriate input data. The proposed solution integrates
prompt engineering techniques with an automated pipeline to evaluate various
LLMs on their ability to generate tests from OpenAPI specifications. The
evaluation focused on metrics such as success rate, test coverage, and mutation
score, enabling a systematic comparison of model performance. The results
indicate that the best-performing LLMs - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic),
Deepseek R1 (Deepseek), Qwen 2.5 32b (Alibaba), and Sabia 3 (Maritaca) -
consistently produced robust and contextually coherent REST API tests. Among
them, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed all other models across every metric,
emerging in this study as the most suitable model for this task. These findings
highlight the potential of LLMs to automate the generation of tests based on
API specifications.

TL;DR: 本文通过大规模实证研究揭示了在自然语言与编程语言(NL-PL)追踪链接恢复任务中，仅依赖文本相似性的局限性，并提出多策略集成方法显著提升了HGT和Gemini 2.5 Pro模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件追踪链接恢复主要依赖文本相似性，但在NL-PL场景中存在语义鸿沟问题，需要探索更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出将多个领域特定辅助策略集成到两种模型中：通过边类型增强的异构图变换器(HGT)和通过额外输入信息增强的基于提示的Gemini 2.5 Pro模型。

Result: 多策略HGT和Gemini 2.5 Pro模型相比原始版本性能显著提升，相比当前最先进方法HGNNLink，在12个开源项目中分别实现了3.68%和8.84%的平均F1分数提升。

Conclusion: 多策略集成方法有效解决了NL-PL追踪链接恢复中的语义鸿沟问题，显著提升了模型性能，为软件追踪领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In the field of software traceability link recovery (TLR), textual similarity
has long been regarded as the core criterion. However, in tasks involving
natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on
textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted
a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing
the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific
auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models:
the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based
Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach
using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case
of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and
Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy
integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method
HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average
F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve
open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy
integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code
TLR task.

Abstract: Upgradation of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) software is quite common
to accommodate evolving industrial requirements. Verifying the correctness of
such upgrades remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a
verification-based approach to ensure the correctness of the existing
functionality in the upgraded version of a PLC software. The method converts
the older and the newer versions of the sequential function chart (SFC) into
two Petri net models. We then verify whether one model is contained within
another, based on a novel containment checking algorithm grounded in symbolic
path equivalence. For this purpose, we have developed a home-grown Petri
net-based containment checker. Experimental evaluation on 80 real-world
benchmarks from the OSCAT library highlights the scalability and effectiveness
of the framework. We have compared our approach with verifAPS, a popular tool
used for software upgradation, and observed nearly 4x performance improvement.

prevalent topics from 3.6 million Stack Overflow posts and applied extractive
summarization techniques to generate concise summaries, including code
snippets. A user study with 30 Android developers assessed the summaries for
coherence, relevance, informativeness, and satisfaction, showing improved
productivity. Integrating formal API knowledge with community-generated content
enhances documentation, making API resources more accessible and actionable

*Edyta Brzychczy,Urszula Jessen,Krzysztof Kluza,Sridhar Sriram,Manuel Vargas Nettelnstroth*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: IoT Miner是一个自动化框架，通过四阶段流程从工业传感器数据生成事件日志，支持过程挖掘。关键创新是使用LLM基于聚类统计生成有意义的标签，并通过新指标评估标签质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在采矿、制造等工业场景中，标准事件日志通常不可用，原始传感器数据缺乏结构和语义，无法直接用于过程挖掘分析。

Method: 四阶段管道：数据预处理、无监督聚类、基于LLM的标签生成（使用领域特定提示）、事件日志构建。使用聚类统计和LLM生成有意义的活动标签。

Result: 在LHD采矿机械传感器数据上评估，结果显示更丰富的提示词能产生更准确和一致的标签。提出了新的评估指标Similarity-Weighted Accuracy。

Conclusion: IoT Miner通过结合AI和领域感知数据处理，提供了一个可扩展且可解释的方法，能够在传统日志缺失的场景中从IoT数据生成事件日志，支持过程挖掘应用。

Abstract: This paper presents IoT Miner, a novel framework for automatically creating
high-level event logs from raw industrial sensor data to support process
mining. In many real-world settings, such as mining or manufacturing, standard
event logs are unavailable, and sensor data lacks the structure and semantics
needed for analysis. IoT Miner addresses this gap using a four-stage pipeline:
data preprocessing, unsupervised clustering, large language model (LLM)-based
labeling, and event log construction. A key innovation is the use of LLMs to
generate meaningful activity labels from cluster statistics, guided by
domain-specific prompts. We evaluate the approach on sensor data from a
Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) mining machine and introduce a new metric,
Similarity-Weighted Accuracy, to assess labeling quality. Results show that
richer prompts lead to more accurate and consistent labels. By combining AI
with domain-aware data processing, IoT Miner offers a scalable and
interpretable method for generating event logs from IoT data, enabling process
mining in settings where traditional logs are missing.

TL;DR: GeoAnalystBench基准测试显示，专有LLM在GIS自动化任务中表现优异（95%有效性），而开源模型表现较差（48.5%有效性），空间推理任务仍是主要挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在GIS工作流自动化中的实际能力，避免对GIS完全自动化做出过早断言

Method: 创建包含50个Python任务的GeoAnalystBench基准，通过专家验证，评估工作流有效性、结构对齐、语义相似性和代码质量（CodeBLEU）

Result: 专有模型（如ChatGPT-4o-mini）有效性达95%，CodeBLEU 0.39；开源模型（如DeepSeek-R1-7B）有效性仅48.5%，CodeBLEU 0.272；空间关系检测和最优选址任务最具挑战性

Conclusion: 当前LLM在GIS自动化中既有潜力也有局限，需要人机协同的研究框架来推进GeoAI发展

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have fueled growing interest
in automating geospatial analysis and GIS workflows, yet their actual
capabilities remain uncertain. In this work, we call for rigorous evaluation of
LLMs on well-defined geoprocessing tasks before making claims about full GIS
automation. To this end, we present GeoAnalystBench, a benchmark of 50
Python-based tasks derived from real-world geospatial problems and carefully
validated by GIS experts. Each task is paired with a minimum deliverable
product, and evaluation covers workflow validity, structural alignment,
semantic similarity, and code quality (CodeBLEU). Using this benchmark, we
assess both proprietary and open source models. Results reveal a clear gap:
proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o-mini achieve high validity 95% and
stronger code alignment (CodeBLEU 0.39), while smaller open source models like
DeepSeek-R1-7B often generate incomplete or inconsistent workflows (48.5%
validity, 0.272 CodeBLEU). Tasks requiring deeper spatial reasoning, such as
spatial relationship detection or optimal site selection, remain the most
challenging across all models. These findings demonstrate both the promise and
limitations of current LLMs in GIS automation and provide a reproducible
framework to advance GeoAI research with human-in-the-loop support.

TL;DR: Code2MCP是一个自动化框架，可将GitHub仓库转换为MCP兼容服务，解决LLM工具集成中的N×M问题，通过多阶段工作流和闭环调试机制实现最小人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型(LLM)工具集成中的N×M问题，即N个模型需要为M个工具定制集成，这种碎片化阻碍创新并带来巨大开发开销。虽然MCP协议已作为标准出现，但其采用受到将现有软件转换为MCP兼容服务所需手动工作的阻碍。

Method: 采用多阶段工作流自动化整个过程，包括代码分析、环境配置、服务生成和部署。关键创新是LLM驱动的闭环"运行-审查-修复"循环，使系统能够自主调试和修复生成的代码。

Result: Code2MCP不仅生成可部署的服务，还提供全面的技术文档，作为加速MCP生态系统的催化剂，系统性地解锁世界上最大的开源代码仓库并自动化工具集成的关键最后一英里。

Conclusion: 该框架通过高度自动化的方式解决了MCP协议采用的主要障碍，为LLM工具集成提供了有效的解决方案，有望显著加速AI代理生态系统的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a significant
integration challenge in the AI agent ecosystem, often called the "$N \times M$
problem," where N models require custom integrations for M tools. This
fragmentation stifles innovation and creates substantial development overhead.
While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to resolve
this, its adoption is hindered by the manual effort required to convert the
vast universe of existing software into MCP-compliant services. This is
especially true for the millions of open-source repositories on GitHub, the
world's largest collection of functional code. This paper introduces Code2MCP,
a highly automated, agentic framework designed to transform any GitHub
repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Our
system employs a multi-stage workflow that automates the entire process, from
code analysis and environment configuration to service generation and
deployment. A key innovation of our framework is an LLM-driven, closed-loop
"Run--Review--Fix" cycle, which enables the system to autonomously debug and
repair the code it generates. Code2MCP produces not only deployable services
but also comprehensive technical documentation, acting as a catalyst to
accelerate the MCP ecosystem by systematically unlocking the world's largest
open-source code repository and automating the critical last mile of tool
integration. The code is open-sourced at

TL;DR: GRACE通过构建多级代码图结构，结合图神经网络检索和结构融合机制，显著提升了LLM在仓库级代码任务中的表现，超越了现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RAG的方法在代码检索时过度依赖文本相似性，忽略了代码的结构关系（如调用链、继承层次），并且通过简单拼接代码片段会丢失关键结构信息，导致LLM在仓库级代码任务中表现不佳。

Method: GRACE构建统一的多级代码图（包含文件结构、AST、函数调用图、类层次结构和数据流图），采用混合图检索器结合图神经网络结构相似性和文本检索，使用图注意力网络重排序，并通过结构融合机制保留关键依赖关系。

Result: 在公共仓库级基准测试中，GRACE在所有指标上显著优于最先进方法。使用DeepSeek-V3作为骨干LLM，GRACE比最强的基于图的RAG基线在EM和ES指标上分别提升8.19%和7.51%。

Conclusion: GRACE通过整合结构信息和文本信息的多层次代码图表示，有效解决了仓库级代码理解中的结构依赖问题，为LLM的代码相关任务提供了更强大的上下文理解能力。

Abstract: LLMs excel in localized code completion but struggle with repository-level
tasks due to limited context windows and complex semantic and structural
dependencies across codebases. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
mitigates context scarcity by retrieving relevant code snippets, current
approaches face significant limitations. They overly rely on textual similarity
for retrieval, neglecting structural relationships such as call chains and
inheritance hierarchies, and lose critical structural information by naively
concatenating retrieved snippets into text sequences for LLM input. To address
these shortcomings, GRACE constructs a multi-level, multi-semantic code graph
that unifies file structures, abstract syntax trees, function call graphs,
class hierarchies, and data flow graphs to capture both static and dynamic code
semantics. For retrieval, GRACE employs a Hybrid Graph Retriever that
integrates graph neural network-based structural similarity with textual
retrieval, refined by a graph attention network-based re-ranker to prioritize
topologically relevant subgraphs. To enhance context, GRACE introduces a
structural fusion mechanism that merges retrieved subgraphs with the local code
context and preserves essential dependencies like function calls and
inheritance. Extensive experiments on public repository-level benchmarks
demonstrate that GRACE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across all metrics. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the backbone LLM, GRACE surpasses the
strongest graph-based RAG baselines by 8.19% EM and 7.51% ES points on every
dataset. The code is available at

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究实证评估了在需求工程课程中集成大语言模型对学生学习体验的影响，发现LLM能提升学生对RE概念的理解，但也带来学术诚信和过度依赖等担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在需求工程教育中的集成如何重塑教学方法，增强学生参与度和动机，同时为学生提供支持未来职业发展的实用工具。

Method: 通过调查问卷收集来自两所大学两门RE课程的179名学生数据，LLM通过不同教学形式（个人作业vs团队敏捷项目）集成到课程作业中。

Result: LLM提高了学生对RE概念的理解，特别是在需求获取和文档化任务中。但学生担忧学术诚信、AI过度依赖以及将AI生成内容整合到作业中的挑战。个人作业学生比团队作业学生感知到更多益处。

Conclusion: 研究为RE教育中有效集成LLM提供了建议，并提出了未来研究方向，以平衡AI辅助学习与RE课程中的批判性思维和协作实践。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Requirements Engineering
(RE) education is reshaping pedagogical approaches, seeking to enhance student
engagement and motivation while providing practical tools to support their
professional future. This study empirically evaluates the impact of integrating
LLMs in RE coursework. We examined how the guided use of LLMs influenced
students' learning experiences, and what benefits and challenges they perceived
in using LLMs in RE practices. The study collected survey data from 179
students across two RE courses in two universities. LLMs were integrated into
coursework through different instructional formats, i.e., individual
assignments versus a team-based Agile project. Our findings indicate that LLMs
improved students' comprehension of RE concepts, particularly in tasks like
requirements elicitation and documentation. However, students raised concerns
about LLMs in education, including academic integrity, overreliance on AI, and
challenges in integrating AI-generated content into assignments. Students who
worked on individual assignments perceived that they benefited more than those
who worked on team-based assignments, highlighting the importance of contextual
AI integration. This study offers recommendations for the effective integration
of LLMs in RE education. It proposes future research directions for balancing
AI-assisted learning with critical thinking and collaborative practices in RE
courses.

Motivation: 出于个人困惑、同行审查评论以及现有文献中存在的明显混淆，需要对法律需求概念进行系统性的审查和分析。

Method: 采用快速审查方法，对需求工程领域研究中关于法律需求的文献进行系统性分析和综述。

Result: 发现存在规范性理解，但缺乏正确定义和概念操作化；法律需求被视为模糊复杂、需要大量工作量；存在知识空白、频繁变化、重叠等问题，且缺乏实证证据支撑。

Conclusion: 该审查提出了关于知识空白和持续概念混淆的批判性论断，指出当前对法律需求的理解存在重大短板需要解决。

Abstract: Out of a personal puzzlement, recent peer review comments, and demonstrable
confusion in the existing literature, the paper presents a rapid review of the
concept of legal requirements (LRs) in requirements engineering (RE) research.
According to reviewing results, a normative understanding of LRs has often been
present, although proper definitions and conceptual operationalizations are
lacking. Some papers also see LRs as functional and others as non-functional
requirements. Legal requirements are often characterized as being vague and
complex, requiring a lot of effort to elicit, implement, and validate. These
characterizations supposedly correlate with knowledge gaps among requirements
engineers. LRs are also seen to often change and overlap. They may be also
prioritized. According to the literature, they seem to be also reluctantly
implemented, often providing only a minimal baseline for other requirements.
With these and other observations, the review raises critical arguments about
apparent knowledge gaps, including a lack of empirical evidence backing the
observations and enduring conceptual confusion.

TL;DR: 本文构建了大规模二进制补丁数据集，系统评估了19个代码LLM在二进制安全补丁检测任务中的表现，发现精细调整后的模型在伪代码表示上取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学习基于源代码的安全补丁检测方法无法应用于闭源软件，而代码大语言模型在二进制分析任务中的潜力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建包含19,448个样本的二进制补丁数据集（汇编代码和伪代码两种表示），系统测试19个代码LLM，并研究了精细调整策略在两种表示层面上的效果。

Result: 直接提问普通代码LLM无法准确识别安全补丁，甚至最先进的提问技术也无法补偿模型缺乏域知识的问题。细调后的LLM表现優异，在伪代码表示上获得最佳性能。

Conclusion: 通过细调注入二进制安全补丁检测域知识，代码LLM可以在二进制层面有效识别安全补丁，为闭源软件安全维护提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Security patch detection (SPD) is crucial for maintaining software security,
as unpatched vulnerabilities can lead to severe security risks. In recent
years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising
results on source code. However, these approaches typically cannot be applied
to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a
significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with
binary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive
performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and
binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their
potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a
significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code
understanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this
gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf{19,448}
samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and
systematically evaluate \textbf{19} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate
their capability in binary SPD tasks. Our initial exploration demonstrates that
directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security
patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques
fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla
models. Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning
strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two
levels of representation. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs
achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the
pseudo-code representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型作为新型软件依赖(SD 2.0)的广泛应用威胁到软件系统的可维护性和可靠性，需要了解开发者如何实际管理和集成这些模型

Method: 采用混合方法分析，从PeaTMOSS数据集的28,575个仓库中随机抽样401个GitHub仓库，定量识别PTM重用模式，定性调查开发者的实际集成管理实践

Result: 研究发现揭示了开源项目中PTM依赖的结构和文档化方式、重用管道中的阶段和组织模式，以及PTM与其他学习组件在管道阶段的交互关系

Conclusion: 该研究为理解SD 2.0在开源项目中的实际应用提供了实证基础，对提高依赖PTM的软件系统的可维护性和可靠性具有重要意义

Abstract: Pre-trained models (PTMs) are machine learning models that have been trained
in advance, often on large-scale data, and can be reused for new tasks, thereby
reducing the need for costly training from scratch. Their widespread adoption
introduces a new class of software dependency, which we term Software
Dependencies 2.0, extending beyond conventional libraries to learned behaviors
embodied in trained models and their associated artifacts. The integration of
PTMs as software dependencies in real projects remains unclear, potentially
threatening maintainability and reliability of modern software systems that
increasingly rely on them. Objective: In this study, we investigate Software
Dependencies 2.0 in open-source software (OSS) projects by examining the reuse
of PTMs, with a focus on how developers manage and integrate these models.
Specifically, we seek to understand: (1) how OSS projects structure and
document their PTM dependencies; (2) what stages and organizational patterns
emerge in the reuse pipelines of PTMs within these projects; and (3) the
interactions among PTMs and other learned components across pipeline stages. We
conduct a mixed-methods analysis of a statistically significant random sample
of 401 GitHub repositories from the PeaTMOSS dataset (28,575 repositories
reusing PTMs from Hugging Face and PyTorch Hub). We quantitatively examine PTM
reuse by identifying patterns and qualitatively investigate how developers
integrate and manage these models in practice.

Conclusion: SASE愿景为软件工程社区提供了概念框架和结构化词汇，推动从以人为中心的传统模式向规模化、可信的智能体未来转变

Abstract: Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0) represents a new era where intelligent
agents are tasked not with simple code generation, but with achieving complex,
goal-oriented SE objectives. To harness these new capabilities while ensuring
trustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in
the Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE
for Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational
pillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest
differently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to
support this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command
center where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such
as Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The
Agent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform
tasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex
trade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated
human callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering
activities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating
the practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This
paper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision,
outlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE. The paper
culminates in a research roadmap that identifies a few key challenges and
opportunities while briefly discussing the resulting impact of this future on
SE education. Our goal is not to offer a definitive solution, but to provide a
conceptual scaffold with structured vocabulary to catalyze a community-wide
dialogue, pushing the SE community to think beyond its classic, human-centric
tenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future.

Motivation: 软件故障可能带来严重后果，但缺乏对行业实践中如何从失败中学习的深入理解。高可靠性组织（HROs）提供了研究软件故障学习实践的宝贵环境。

Method: 通过10个深度访谈在国家空间研究中心进行研究软件工程师的案例研究，并包括来自其他HROs的5个额外访谈数据以评估可转移性。

Result: 研究发现：(1)失败学习是非正式、临时的，未一致整合到软件开发生命周期中；(2)由于缺乏结构化流程，重复故障持续存在；(3)时间限制、人员流动导致的知识流失、文档碎片化和流程执行不力等关键挑战阻碍了系统性学习。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对软件工程师如何从失败中学习的理解，并为改进故障管理实践提供了指导。

Abstract: Software failures can have significant consequences, making learning from
failures a critical aspect of software engineering. While software
organizations are recommended to conduct postmortems, the effectiveness and
adoption of these practices vary widely. Understanding how engineers gather,
document, share, and apply lessons from failures is essential for improving
reliability and preventing recurrence. High-reliability organizations (HROs)
often develop software systems where failures carry catastrophic risks,
requiring continuous learning to ensure reliability. These organizations
provide a valuable setting to examine practices and challenges for learning
from software failures. Such insight could help develop processes and tools to
improve reliability and prevent recurrence. However, we lack in-depth industry
perspectives on the practices and challenges of learning from failures.
  To address this gap, we conducted a case study through 10 in-depth interviews
with research software engineers at a national space research center. We
examine how they learn from failures: how they gather, document, share, and
apply lessons. To assess transferability, we include data from 5 additional
interviews at other HROs. Our findings provide insight into how engineers learn
from failures in practice. To summarize: (1) failure learning is informal, ad
hoc, and inconsistently integrated into SDLC; (2) recurring failures persist
due to absence of structured processes; and (3) key challenges, including time
constraints, knowledge loss from turnover and fragmented documentation, and
weak process enforcement, undermine systematic learning. Our findings deepen
understanding of how software engineers learn from failures and offer guidance
for improving failure management practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python生态系统缺乏像Java那样可扩展的运行时验证系统，现有的Python RV系统要么局限于特定领域或规范逻辑，要么运行速度缓慢，无法满足大规模应用的需求。

Method: 开发了PyMOP系统，支持五种逻辑，实现了五种现有的监控算法，提供了73个Python及常用库的API规范，支持三种插桩策略，并且用户可以轻松扩展更多功能。

Result: 在1,463个GitHub项目的290,133个单元测试中：(i)Java的默认监控算法在Python中通常不是最快的；(ii)PyMOP比两个最近的动态分析系统快达1,168.3倍；(iii)PyMOP帮助发现的121个bug中有44个已被开发者修复。

Conclusion: PyMOP的通用性和高效性使其成为Python运行时验证研究的优秀平台，为Python生态系统的RV技术发展奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Runtime verification (RV) now scales for testing thousands of open-source
Java projects, helping find hundreds of bugs. The popular Python ecosystem
could use such benefits. But, today's Python RV systems are limited to a domain
or specification logic, or slow. We propose PyMOP, a generic, extensible, and
efficient RV system for Python. PyMOP supports five logics, implements five
existing monitoring algorithms, ships with 73 API specs of Python and
widely-used libraries, supports three instrumentation strategies, and users can
easily add more of these. On 290,133 unit tests in 1,463 GitHub projects, we
find mainly that (i) the default monitoring algorithm for Java is often not the
fastest for Python; (ii) PyMOP is up to 1,168.3x faster than two recent dynamic
analysis systems; and (iii) 44 of 121 bugs that PyMOP helped find so far were
fixed by developers. PyMOP's generality and efficiency position it well as an
excellent platform for the next advances on RV for Python.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在软件工程中应用日益增长，但它们经常产生不稳定的结果，特别是在代码修复任务中的一致性还未得到全面评估

Method: 使用不同错误类型的代码样本，在不同温度设置（0、0.5、1）下获取ChatGPT的修复建议，通过语法相似性和输出等效率指标评估结构和功能一致性

Result: 温度越高，模型输出越不稳定和变化，高温度下功能失败率特别高；低温度下建议修复结构相似，高温度下显示显著结构差异

Conclusion: 研究疑问了基于LLM的错误纠正系统的可靠性，为软件开发过程中更一致地应用这些系统提供了重要方法论见解

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering tasks is
growing, especially in the areas of bug fixing and code generation.
Nevertheless, these models often yield unstable results; when executed at
different times with the same input, they can generate radically different
code. The consistency of LLMs in bug-fixing tasks has not yet been thoroughly
assessed, despite the fact that this instability has typically been discussed
in the literature in relation to code generation. The purpose of this study is
to look into how unstable an LLM like ChatGPT is when it comes to fixing code
bugs. We examine the structural, syntactic, and functional variations among
several fix recommendations made in response to the same prompt using code
samples with various error types. Additionally, we assess how instability is
affected by the temperature settings (0, 0.5, and 1) used for the model's
deterministic operation. For a total of 20 problems in the experimental
analysis, the model produced three fix suggestions at each temperature value,
comparing nine distinct outputs for each problem. The Syntax Similarity and
Output Equivalence Rate (OER) metrics were used to assess the outputs'
structural and functional consistency. The results demonstrate that the model's
outputs become much more unstable and variable as the temperature rises, with
high temperatures showing especially high rates of functional failure.
According to syntax similarity analyses, the suggested fixes show notable
structural differences at high temperatures but are fairly similar at low
temperatures. The purpose of this study is to provide important methodological
insights into how LLM-based error correction systems can be applied more
consistently in software development processes while also casting doubt on
their dependability.

Conclusion: 设计多元宇宙概念有效解决了复杂系统设计中的版本控制和变体管理问题，为多参与者协同设计提供了新的技术支撑

Abstract: Real-world design processes often involve the evolution and divergence of
design paths (by branching, revising, merging, etc.), especially when multiple
stakeholders or teams operate concurrently and/or explore different
alternatives for complex and heterogeneous systems. Unfortunately, this
variability in time and space can not be directly managed in current modeling
spaces but requires resorting to external tools and methodologies.
  In order to tackle this problem, we introduce the Design Multiverse. The
Design Multiverse aims to integrate in the modeling space a selection of
revisions and variants, representing snapshots of a design state composed of
multiple artifacts. This enables stakeholders to seamlessly trace, analyze, and
manage design decisions, system variants, and their interdependencies.
Concretely, in this paper we present a conceptual definition of the Design
Multiverse, discuss usage scenarios such as model product lines and
model/metamodel co-evolution, and propose an implementation leveraging the
model federation paradigm.

Motivation: 解决企业内部依赖关系，提升业务管理流程，需要开发支持图形界面、层次结构和易用性的建模框架来缩短新手用户的学习曲线

Method: 使用Eclipse建模框架(EMF)和图形建模框架(GMF)构建Bmod DSL，并与其他建模工具(AToMPM、metaDepth、Sirius等)在表达能力、学习曲线和性能方面进行比较

Result: 开发了Bmod DSL用于疏散场景建模，通过Eclipse EMF/GMF实现了图形界面支持

Conclusion: Eclipse EMF/GMF为构建DSL提供了有效的技术基础，Bmod DSL展示了其在特定领域建模中的应用价值

Abstract: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) play a crucial role in resolving internal
dependencies across enterprises and boosts their upfront business management
processes. Yet, a lot of development is needed to build modelling frameworks
which support graphical interfaces (canvas, pallettes etc.), hierarchical
structures and easy implementation to shorten the gap for novice users. In this
paper, a DSL namely, Bmod is introduced, which can be used to model evacuation
scenarios. The language is built using Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF) and
Eclipse Graphical Modelling Framework (GMF). Furthermore, a comparison is also
shown between Eclipse EMF/GMF and other modelling tools such as AToMPM,
metaDepth, Sirius etc with respect to expressiveness, learning curve and
performance.

TL;DR: 提出BISS方法，通过测试套件优化技术减少基准测试的计算成本，同时保持变体排名的稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试在软件工程中用于评估软件变体的质量和性能，但执行完整基准测试的计算资源和时间成本极高

Method: BISection Sampling (BISS)方法，策略性地保留最关键测试，并应用新颖的分治方法在相关剩余测试中进行高效采样

Result: 在LLM排行榜、SAT竞赛和可配置系统性能建模数据集上实验，平均将基准测试计算成本降低到44%，超过一半的基准测试可降低高达99%的成本，且排名稳定性无损失

Conclusion: BISS方法能显著减少基准测试的计算开销，同时保持变体排名的准确性，在多个应用场景中都表现出优于基线方法的性能

Abstract: Benchmarking is a common practice in software engineering to assess the
qualities and performance of software variants, coming from multiple competing
systems or from configurations of the same system. Benchmarks are used notably
to compare and understand variant performance, fine-tune software, detect
regressions, or design new software systems. The execution of benchmarks to get
a complete picture of software variants is highly costly in terms of
computational resources and time. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
for reducing benchmarks while maintaining stable rankings, using test suite
optimization techniques. That is, we remove instances from the benchmarks while
trying to keep the same rankings of the variants on all tests. Our method,
BISection Sampling, BISS, strategically retains the most critical tests and
applies a novel divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently sample among
relevant remaining tests. We experiment with datasets and use cases from LLM
leaderboards, SAT competitions, and configurable systems for performance
modeling. Our results show that our method outperforms baselines even when
operating on a subset of variants. Using BISS, we reduce the computational cost
of the benchmarks on average to 44% and on more than half the benchmarks by up
to 99% without loss in ranking stability.

TL;DR: OpenCoderRank是一个易于使用的平台，用于模拟技术评估，在资源受限环境中为问题设置者和解决者提供无成本、可定制的解决方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM时代，虽然LLM能帮助问题设置者生成多样化挑战性问题，但也可能通过提供解决方案来破坏评估的完整性，需要一种平衡双方需求的平台

Method: 开发OpenCoderRank平台，作为问题设置者和解决者之间的桥梁，支持自托管评估，模拟时间限制和陌生问题的技术评估环境

Result: 平台为问题解决者提供了准备时间限制和陌生问题的机会，同时允许问题设置者在资源受限环境中进行无成本、可定制的技术评估

Conclusion: OpenCoderRank成功搭建了一个连接问题设置者和解决者的桥梁，在LLM时代为技术评估提供了有效的解决方案，特别适合资源受限的环境

Abstract: Organizations and educational institutions use time-bound assessment tasks to
evaluate coding and problem-solving skills. These assessments measure not only
the correctness of the solutions, but also their efficiency. Problem setters
(educator/interviewer) are responsible for crafting these challenges, carefully
balancing difficulty and relevance to create meaningful evaluation experiences.
Conversely, problem solvers (student/interviewee) apply coding efficiency and
logical thinking to arrive at correct solutions. In the era of Large Language
Models (LLMs), LLMs assist problem setters in generating diverse and
challenging questions, but they can undermine assessment integrity for problem
solvers by providing easy access to solutions. This paper introduces
OpenCoderRank, an easy-to-use platform designed to simulate technical
assessments. It acts as a bridge between problem setters and problem solvers,
helping solvers prepare for time constraints and unfamiliar problems while
allowing setters to self-host assessments, offering a no-cost and customizable
solution for technical assessments in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: HyGLAD是一种自动构建可解释模式来建模事件数据的新算法，用于检测静态系统中的事件异常，通过正则表达式提供可解释的异常检测，在性能和效率上均优于深度学习方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种可解释的事件异常检测方法，解决深度学习方法的黑盒问题，同时提高检测性能和效率

Method: 通过推断具有相似行为的实体等价类，构建捕获这些实体值的正则表达式模式

Result: 在5个真实数据集上评估，平均性能优于所有7种DeepOD无监督方法，训练和推理效率提高一个数量级，精确度提高1.2倍，召回率提高1.3倍

Conclusion: HyGLAD提供了一种高效且可解释的事件异常检测解决方案，在保持高性能的同时显著优于深度学习方法

Abstract: We propose HyGLAD, a novel algorithm that automatically builds a set of
interpretable patterns that model event data. These patterns can then be used
to detect event-based anomalies in a stationary system, where any deviation
from past behavior may indicate malicious activity. The algorithm infers
equivalence classes of entities with similar behavior observed from the events,
and then builds regular expressions that capture the values of those entities.
As opposed to deep-learning approaches, the regular expressions are directly
interpretable, which also translates to interpretable anomalies. We evaluate
HyGLAD against all 7 unsupervised anomaly detection methods from DeepOD on five
datasets from real-world systems. The experimental results show that on average
HyGLAD outperforms existing deep-learning methods while being an order of
magnitude more efficient in training and inference (single CPU vs GPU).
Precision improved by 1.2x and recall by 1.3x compared to the second-best
baseline.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用分位数福利评估作为健康政策评估的替代方法，与传统的功利主义评估形成对比。论文将Manski(1988)的分位数效用最大化思想从个体决策扩展到社会规划领域，并开发了基于二元选择时间权衡实验数据的非参数边界估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用分位数效用最大化只需要序数效用而非基数效用的优势，将这一思想从个体决策分析扩展到社会规划分析，为健康政策评估提供新的理论框架和方法。

Method: 1) 总结分位数福利的基本理论性质；2) 提出基于二元选择时间权衡实验数据的非参数边界估计程序；3) 使用EQ-5D框架评估相关的计量经济学测量问题。

Result: 开发了一套完整的基于分位数福利的健康政策评估方法论框架，包括理论性质分析、非参数估计程序和计量经济学测量评估。

Conclusion: 分位数福利评估为健康政策分析提供了有前景的替代方法，特别适用于只需要序数效用信息的场景，具有重要的理论和实践价值。

Abstract: This paper considers quantile-welfare evaluation of health policy as an
alternative to utilitarian evaluation. Manski (1988) originally proposed and
studied maximization of quantile utility as a model of individual decision
making under uncertainty, juxtaposing it with maximization of expected utility.
That paper's primary motivation was to exploit the fact that maximization of
quantile utility requires only an ordinal formalization of utility, not a
cardinal one. This paper transfers these ideas from analysis of individual
decision making to analysis of social planning. We begin by summarizing basic
theoretical properties of quantile welfare in general terms rather than related
specifically to health policy. We then propose a procedure to nonparametrically
bound the quantile welfare of health states using data from binary-choice
time-tradeoff (TTO) experiments of the type regularly performed by health
economists. After this we assess related econometric considerations concerning
measurement, using the EQ-5D framework to structure our discussion.

TL;DR: Largevars R包实现了基于大N、T渐近理论的高维向量自回归协整检验，该检验是Johansen似然比检验的改进版本，在无协整关系时收敛于Airy_1点过程的部分和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协整检验方法在高维时间序列分析中存在局限性，需要开发适用于大维度向量自回归模型的协整检验工具。

Method: 基于Bykhovskaya和Gorin(2022,2025)的大N、T渐近理论，对Johansen似然比检验进行改进，实现高维VAR(k)模型的协整检验。

Result: 开发了Largevars R包，提供了Airy_1点过程前十个部分和的模拟分位数（精确到前3位），并通过S&P100股票数据和模拟VAR(2)示例验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Largevars包为高维时间序列的协整分析提供了有效的统计工具，填补了传统方法在大维度场景下的空白。

Abstract: Cointegration is a property of multivariate time series that determines
whether its non-stationary, growing components have a stationary linear
combination. Largevars R package conducts a cointegration test for
high-dimensional vector autoregressions of order k based on the large N, T
asymptotics of Bykhovskaya and Gorin (2022, 2025). The implemented test is a
modification of the Johansen likelihood ratio test. In the absence of
cointegration the test converges to the partial sum of the Airy_1 point
process, an object arising in random matrix theory.
  The package and this article contain simulated quantiles of the first ten
partial sums of the Airy_1 point process that are precise up to the first 3
digits. We also include two examples using Largevars: an empirical example on
S&P100 stocks and a simulated VAR(2) example.

Motivation: BRIC国家汇率存在长记忆、非线性和非稳定性特征，传统时间序列模型难以抓取，需要灵活的模型框架来处理外部驱动因素的影响。

Method: 结合ARFIMA的长记忆表征和神经网络的非线性学习能力，灵活整合外生变量，使用Markov链和非线性时间序列技术证明模型的较大样术稳定性，采用遵循预测区间评估预测不确定性。

Result: 在六个预测水平上，NARFIMA模型在BRIC汇率预测中一贯表现超过各种现有的统计学和机器学习模型。

Conclusion: NARFIMA模型为政策制定者和市场参与者提供了新的见解，有助于应对波动的金融环境，并提供了R包实现。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of exchange rates remains a persistent challenge,
particularly for emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China
(BRIC). These series exhibit long memory, nonlinearity, and non-stationarity
properties that conventional time series models struggle to capture.
Additionally, there exist several key drivers of exchange rate dynamics,
including global economic policy uncertainty, US equity market volatility, US
monetary policy uncertainty, oil price growth rates, and country-specific
short-term interest rate differentials. These empirical complexities underscore
the need for a flexible modeling framework that can jointly accommodate long
memory, nonlinearity, and the influence of external drivers. To address these
challenges, we propose a Neural AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated Moving
Average (NARFIMA) model that combines the long-memory representation of ARFIMA
with the nonlinear learning capacity of neural networks, while flexibly
incorporating exogenous causal variables. We establish theoretical properties
of the model, including asymptotic stationarity of the NARFIMA process using
Markov chains and nonlinear time series techniques. We quantify forecast
uncertainty using conformal prediction intervals within the NARFIMA framework.
Empirical results across six forecast horizons show that NARFIMA consistently
outperforms various state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models in
forecasting BRIC exchange rates. These findings provide new insights for
policymakers and market participants navigating volatile financial conditions.
The \texttt{narfima} \textbf{R} package provides an implementation of our
approach.

along with an estimate of the maximal welfare (i.e., the value-function
estimated at optimal policy) using regression adjustment (RA),
inverse-probability weighting (IPW), and doubly robust (DR) formulas.

*Bernhard Wortmann,Detlef Stolten,Heidi Heinrichs*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: PEM电解制氢技术面临铱催化剂稀缺性挑战，预计2030年可能出现供应短缺，需通过提高催化剂效率和回收利用来满足碳中和目标需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质子交换膜电解(PEMEL)是生产绿色氢气的关键技术，但其规模化受到稀缺材料铱的限制。铱氧化物作为优选阳极催化剂年产量仅约7.5吨，需要评估未来需求与供应匹配情况

Method: 研究通过估算不同部署情景和技术进步下的未来铱需求，分析PEMEL规模化对铱资源的依赖程度

Result: 结果显示：实现净零目标需要催化剂效率显著提升，并占用全球约30%的铱年产量；供应短缺可能最早在2030年出现；2040年后的长期铱需求被严重低估

Conclusion: 研究强调迫切需要材料效率和回收创新，并将资源约束纳入能源政策和技术规划，以确保氢能转型的可持续性

Abstract: Proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEMEL) is a key technology for
producing green hydrogen, but its scalability is limited by the use of scarce
materials, particularly iridium. Iridium oxide, the preferred anode catalyst in
PEMEL, offers exceptional stability but is produced only as a by-product of
platinum mining, with annual output around 7.5 tons. This study estimates
future iridium demand for PEMEL under various deployment scenarios and
technological advances. Results show that meeting net zero targets will require
both significant improvements in catalyst efficiency and access to roughly 30\%
of global iridium production annually. Supply shortages could arise as early as
2030, earlier than previously anticipated. The analysis also reveals that
long-term iridium needs beyond 2040 are significantly underestimated. These
findings underscore the urgent need for innovation in material efficiency and
recycling, and the importance of integrating resource constraints into energy
policy and technology planning to ensure a sustainable hydrogen transition.

Motivation: 研究生成式AI如何改变专家服务市场，量化LLM对不同市场结构的行为、福利和分配影响，特别是在信任商品框架下分析专家私人信息的作用。

Method: 使用一系列一次性实验，在信任商品框架下比较AI-AI、人-人、人-AI和人-AI-人四种专家市场的表现，分析专家偏好和消费者信任的影响。

Result: 人-人市场效率最高；LLM专家获得更高剩余但损害消费者；多数人类专家选择依赖LLM代理；透明度下人-AI-人市场表现最佳；信息模糊时效率增益消失。

Conclusion: LLM在专家服务中既带来机遇也带来风险：可能负面影响人类信任和专家利他偏好，但也能通过编码专家目标函数减少信息不对称并提高效率，需要相应监管措施。

Abstract: Generative AI is transforming the provision of expert services. This article
uses a series of one-shot experiments to quantify the behavioral, welfare and
distribution consequences of large language models (LLMs) on AI-AI,
Human-Human, Human-AI and Human-AI-Human expert markets. Using a credence goods
framework where experts have private information about the optimal service for
consumers, we find that Human-Human markets generally achieve higher levels of
efficiency than AI-AI and Human-AI markets through pro-social expert
preferences and higher consumer trust. Notably, LLM experts still earn
substantially higher surplus than human experts -- at the expense of consumer
surplus - suggesting adverse incentives that may spur the harmful deployment of
LLMs. Concurrently, a majority of human experts chooses to rely on LLM agents
when given the opportunity in Human-AI-Human markets, especially if they have
agency over the LLM's (social) objective function. Here, a large share of
experts prioritizes efficiency-loving preferences over pure self-interest.
Disclosing these preferences to consumers induces strong efficiency gains by
marginalizing self-interested LLM experts and human experts. Consequently,
Human-AI-Human markets outperform Human-Human markets under transparency rules.
With obfuscation, however, efficiency gains disappear, and adverse expert
incentives remain. Our results shed light on the potential opportunities and
risks of disseminating LLMs in the context of expert services and raise several
regulatory challenges. On the one hand, LLMs can negatively affect human trust
in the presence of information asymmetries and partially crowd-out experts'
other-regarding preferences through automation. On the other hand, LLMs allow
experts to codify and communicate their objective function, which reduces
information asymmetries and increases efficiency.

Motivation: 研究环境执法对巴西亚马逊地区暴力的影响，探讨政府监控和执法如何通过增强国家存在来减少资源冲突相关的暴力事件。

Method: 利用云层覆盖导致卫星监测的外生变化作为执法强度的工具变量，识别DETER系统实施的因果效应。

Result: DETER系统的引入使凶杀案减少了15%，相当于每年预防1477起命案，表明环境执法显著降低了地区暴力水平。

Conclusion: 遏制森林砍伐不仅保护环境，还能通过增强国家存在和制度能力，在制度脆弱的资源冲突地区产生重要的社会协同效益，减少暴力犯罪。

Abstract: We estimate the impact of environmental law enforcement on violence in the
Brazilian Amazon. The introduction of the Real-Time Deforestation Detection
System (DETER), which enabled the government to monitor deforestation in real
time and issue fines for illegal clearing, significantly reduced homicides in
the region. To identify causal effects, we exploit exogenous variation in
satellite monitoring generated by cloud cover as an instrument for enforcement
intensity. Our estimates imply that the expansion of state presence through
DETER prevented approximately 1,477 homicides per year, a 15% reduction in
homicides. These results show that curbing deforestation produces important
social co-benefits, strengthening state presence and reducing violence in
regions marked by institutional fragility and resource conflict.

Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data, spanning 1979-2019, to generate a data
product we describe and make newly available to the research community. We
detail the construction of this unprecedentedly long food security panel data
series in PSID data. Finally, we estimate key subpopulation- and national-level
food security dynamics identifiable over the 40-year (1979-2019) period
spanning multiple recessions and federal nutrition assistance policy changes,
including disaggregated dynamics based on geography, race, sex, and educational

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球幸福感比较日益依赖生活评估调查问题，但这些测量工具的可比性尚未得到当代全球数据的验证，国际排名和政策制定需要可靠的比较基础

Method: 使用盖洛普世界民意调查、全球繁荣研究和世界价值观调查数据，分析两种问题格式的分布、排名和响应模式差异，并通过回归系数比较受访者的认知解释差异

Result: 两种问题格式产生不同的分布、排名和响应模式，这些差异因国家和调查而异，国际幸福感排名不稳定，但幸福感决定因素的科学研究相对稳健

Conclusion: 研究结果强调需要重新制定研究议程，关注幸福感跨国可比性的关键限制，国际排名应谨慎使用，而幸福感决定因素的研究更具可靠性

Abstract: Global comparisons of wellbeing increasingly rely on survey questions that
ask respondents to evaluate their lives, most commonly in the form of "life
satisfaction" and "Cantril ladder" items. These measures underpin international
rankings such as the World Happiness Report and inform policy initiatives
worldwide, yet their comparability has not been established with contemporary
global data. Using the Gallup World Poll, Global Flourishing Study, and World
Values Survey, I show that the two question formats yield divergent
distributions, rankings, and response patterns that vary across countries and
surveys, defying simple explanations. To explore differences in respondents'
cognitive interpretations, I compare regression coefficients from the Global
Flourishing Study, analyzing how each question wording relates to life
circumstances. While international rankings of wellbeing are unstable, the
scientific study of the determinants of life evaluations appears more robust.
Together, the findings underscore the need for a renewed research agenda on
critical limitations to cross-country comparability of wellbeing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于定位函数的新分析方法，用于研究单调性条件下的动态优化问题最优路径，无需求解完整动态规划即可获得稳态分析和比较静态结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态优化问题分析通常需要求解完整的动态规划，过程复杂且计算量大。本文旨在开发一种更简单直接的分析方法，通过构造定位函数来识别稳态和稳定性。

Method: 构建定位函数——直接从模型原语构造的简单对象，其根识别内部稳态，斜率决定局部稳定性。在严格凹性条件下可完全描述定性动态，非凹性条件下仍能获得明确结果。

Result: 定位函数方法能够：1) 识别内部稳态；2) 确定局部稳定性；3) 在严格凹性下完整描述吸引域；4) 实现稳态参数的比较静态分析。方法在多个经济模型中得到了验证。

Conclusion: 定位函数方法为动态优化问题提供了一种简单而强大的分析工具，避免了复杂动态规划的求解，能够在一般单调性条件下获得稳态和稳定性的清晰特征。

Abstract: We develop a novel analytical method for studying optimal paths in dynamic
optimization problems under general monotonicity conditions. The method centers
on a locator function -- a simple object constructed directly from the model's
primitives -- whose roots identify interior steady states and whose slope
determines their local stability. Under strict concavity of the payoff
function, the locator function also characterizes basins of attraction,
yielding a complete description of qualitative dynamics. Without concavity, it
can still deliver sharp results: if the function is single crossing from above,
its root identifies a globally stable steady state; if the locator function is
inverted-U-shaped with two interior roots (a typical case), only the higher
root can be a locally stable interior steady state. The locator function
further enables comparative statics of steady states with respect to parameters
through direct analysis of its derivatives. These results are obtained without
solving the full dynamic program. We illustrate the approach using a
generalized neoclassical growth model, a rational (un)fitness model, and a
learning-by-doing economy.

Result: 实证上最合理的是叉状结构（Z→{Rm, Ri}），而非Rm→Ri。OLS beta反映的是Rm捕捉底层驱动因素Z的能力，而非因果传导。真正的市场到个股的因果关系只存在于滞后关系中，且经济意义有限。

Conclusion: CAPM应被理解为关联性而非因果性模型。风险管理和归因应从固定因子菜单转向明确定义的因果路径，alpha应定义为在明确阻断这些因果路径后仍保持不变的收益。

Abstract: The CAPM regression is typically interpreted as if the market return
contemporaneously \emph{causes} individual returns, motivating beta-neutral
portfolios and factor attribution. For realized equity returns, however, this
interpretation is inconsistent: a same-period arrow $R_{m,t} \to R_{i,t}$
conflicts with the fact that $R_m$ is itself a value-weighted aggregate of its
constituents, unless $R_m$ is lagged or leave-one-out -- the ``aggregator
contradiction.'' We formalize CAPM as a structural causal model and analyze the
admissible three-node graphs linking an external driver $Z$, the market $R_m$,
and an asset $R_i$. The empirically plausible baseline is a \emph{fork}, $Z \to
\{R_m, R_i\}$, not $R_m \to R_i$. In this setting, OLS beta reflects not a
causal transmission, but an attenuated proxy for how well $R_m$ captures the
underlying driver $Z$. Consequently, ``beta-neutral'' portfolios can remain
exposed to macro or sectoral shocks, and hedging on $R_m$ can import
index-specific noise. Using stylized models and large-cap U.S.\ equity data, we
show that contemporaneous betas act like proxies rather than mechanisms; any
genuine market-to-stock channel, if at all, appears only at a lag and with
modest economic significance. The practical message is clear: CAPM should be
read as associational. Risk management and attribution should shift from fixed
factor menus to explicitly declared causal paths, with ``alpha'' reserved for
what remains invariant once those causal paths are explicitly blocked.

### [352] [What Slips the Mind Stalls the Deal: Delay in Bargaining with Absentmindedness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05828)

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的讨价还价延迟来源：心不在焉。当谈判者不知道日历时间时，可能会在交易截止日期临近时理性地拒绝"最后通牒式报价"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的有限期讨价还价模型无法产生截止日期效应或延迟，因为玩家会预见未来的博弈路径并立即达成交易以避免摩擦。

Method: 引入心不在焉的概念，即谈判者不知道具体时间，通过理性混淆作为谈判力量的来源，建立包含历史依赖策略的均衡模型。

Result: 当玩家有耐心时，存在延迟的均衡；存在马尔可夫完美延迟均衡的必要充分条件是可行报价空间必须足够不连续。

Conclusion: 心不在焉是讨价还价中延迟的合理来源，理性混淆为心不在焉的一方提供了谈判优势，促使对方在截止日期前提出公平报价。

Abstract: In finite-horizon bargaining, deals are often made "on the courthouse steps",
just before the deadline. Most classic finite-horizon bargaining models fail to
generate deadline effects, or even delay, in equilibrium. Players foresee the
future path of play, and come to a deal immediately to circumvent bargaining
frictions. We propose a novel source of bargaining delay: absentmindedness. A
bargainer who does not know the calendar time may rationally reject an
"ultimatum offer" as the trade deadline looms. Rational confusion is a source
of bargaining power for the absentminded player, as it induces the other party
to make fair offers near the trade deadline to prevent negotiations from
breaking down. The absentminded party may reject greedier offers in hope of
receiving a fair offer closer to the deadline. If any offer is feasible, there
are equilibria which feature delay if and only if players are patient. Such
equilibria always involve history-dependent strategies. I provide a necessary
and sufficient condition for there to exist a Markov perfect equilibrium with
delay: the space of feasible offers must be sufficiently disconnected.

### [353] [Contracting against Non-contractible Outsider](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06267)
*Hongcheng Li*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文研究存在外部性和不可缔约外部参与者的契约设计问题，通过新颖的对偶方法解决多重均衡问题，发现最优激励会减弱，且公共契约可能比私人契约产生更低的剩余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在存在外部性和不可缔约外部参与者的情况下，由于战略对称性导致多重均衡的问题，需要解决战略不确定性并设计最优契约机制。

Method: 采用新颖的对偶方法，将委托人的问题重新表述为一系列选择代理人期望的问题，关键约束是委托人无法让代理人预期外部参与者不会保证的响应。

Result: 由于战略租金的存在，委托人最优地诱导减弱的代理人激励；在完全对称的战略依赖下，协调和承诺能力成为完美替代品；公共契约可能严格降低委托人的剩余。

Conclusion: 该研究为存在外部性和不可缔约参与者的契约设计提供了新的理论框架，在国际竞争监管、平台设计和工会契约等领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: This paper studies contracting in the presence of externalities with a
non-contractible outsider. Multiple equilibria arise from strategic symmetry
between the insider agent and the outsider. To address strategic uncertainty,
the principal guarantees their actions in a unique equilibrium. A novel duality
approach reformulates her problem as a series of problems in which she selects
agent expectations. The key constraint is that the principal cannot convince
the agent to expect non-guaranteed response from the outsider. Due to strategic
rents, the principal optimally induces attenuated agent incentives. With
completely symmetric strategic dependence, her coordination and commitment
power become perfect substitutes; in addition, public contracting can strictly
decrease her surplus compared to private contracting, in sharp contrast with
the case where she ignores robustness. Applications include regulating
international competition, platform design, and labor union contracting.

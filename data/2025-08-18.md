### [1] [Grounding Rule-Based Argumentation Using Datalog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10976)
*Martin Diller,Sarah Alice Gaggl,Philipp Hanisch,Giuseppina Monterosso,Fritz Rauschenbach*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASPIC+框架缺乏对一阶规则的高效支持，本文提出了一种智能基础化方法，通过Datalog转换和查询优化，避免无效规则的基础化，并验证了其可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASPIC+方法仅支持命题规则，一阶规则需要基础化步骤，但基础化可能导致理论规模指数增长，缺乏专门解决方案。

Method: 将一阶ASPIC+实例转换为Datalog程序，利用Datalog引擎获取基础替换，并针对ASPIC+形式提出简化方法避免无效规则基础化。

Result: 提出了一种智能基础化方法，保持推理正确性的同时控制基础化规模，并通过原型实现验证了可扩展性。

Conclusion: 本文方法有效解决了ASPIC+中一阶规则的基础化问题，为高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: ASPIC+ is one of the main general frameworks for rule-based argumentation for
AI. Although first-order rules are commonly used in ASPIC+ examples, most
existing approaches to reason over rule-based argumentation only support
propositional rules. To enable reasoning over first-order instances, a
preliminary grounding step is required. As groundings can lead to an
exponential increase in the size of the input theories, intelligent procedures
are needed. However, there is a lack of dedicated solutions for ASPIC+.
Therefore, we propose an intelligent grounding procedure that keeps the size of
the grounding manageable while preserving the correctness of the reasoning
process. To this end, we translate the first-order ASPIC+ instance into a
Datalog program and query a Datalog engine to obtain ground substitutions to
perform the grounding of rules and contraries. Additionally, we propose
simplifications specific to the ASPIC+ formalism to avoid grounding of rules
that have no influence on the reasoning process. Finally, we performed an
empirical evaluation of a prototypical implementation to show scalability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多主体算法追索框架，解决现实世界中多个追索寻求者和提供者之间的交互问题，通过三层优化实现社会福祉最大化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，算法追索通常涉及多个交互主体，而现有研究多关注单主体场景，忽略了多主体竞争资源的复杂性。

Method: 将多主体交互建模为带权二分图匹配问题，提出三层优化框架：基础容量匹配、最优容量再分配和成本感知优化。

Result: 实验验证表明，该框架能在系统设置最小修改下实现接近最优的社会福祉。

Conclusion: 该研究将算法追索从个体推荐扩展到系统设计，为提升社会福祉提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Decision makers are increasingly relying on machine learning in sensitive
situations. In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals
with actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven
decisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual
(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world
applications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing
outcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the
inherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact
and compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel
framework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple
recourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction
as a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided
by both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse
costs, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap
between individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a
three-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal
capacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware
optimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.
Experimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that
our framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve
near-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings. This work
extends algorithmic recourse from individual recommendations to system-level
design, providing a tractable path toward higher social welfare while
maintaining individual actionability.

### [3] [Learn to optimize for automatic proton PBS treatment planning for H&N cancers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11085)
*Qingqing Wang,Liqiang Xiao,Chang Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的逆优化器，结合PPO自动治疗计划框架，显著提升了头颈癌质子PBS治疗计划的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统质子PBS治疗计划中逆优化依赖理论驱动方法、耗时且效率低下的问题。

Method: 采用L2O方法预测更新步骤，结合Transformer处理长上下文，并与PPO框架集成，自动调整目标参数。

Result: 相比L-BFGSB，逆优化器效率提升36.41%，有效性提升22.97%；生成的计划在2.55小时内达到或优于人工计划。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的逆优化器与PPO框架结合，显著提升了治疗计划的效率和质量，适用于多种复杂临床场景。

Abstract: Proton PBS treatment planning for H&N cancers involves numerous conflicting
objectives, requiring significant effort from human planners to balance and
satisfy multiple clinical goals during planning. To achieve this,
experience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally
expensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts
have been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most
time-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on
theory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and
integrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to
automatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning
time. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by
learning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we
integrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed
for LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability
issue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop
virtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy
network, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The
inner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based
on objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in
this study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves
the effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively. In
conjunction with the PPO-based learned virtual planner, plans generated by our
framework within an average of 2.55 hours show improved or comparable OAR
sparing with superior target coverage for patients with different prescription
dose levels, number of target volumes, beam angles, etc., compared with
human-generated plans.

### [4] [On Strong and Weak Admissibility in Non-Flat Assumption-Based Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11182)
*Matti Berthold,Lydia Blümel,Anna Rapberger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文扩展了假设基础论证（ABA）中可接受性概念的研究，探讨了强和弱可接受性及其语义，并展示了其在非平坦ABA中的性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ABA中可接受性概念的多样性，填补强可接受性在ABA中的研究空白，并扩展弱可接受性到非平坦ABA。

Method: 使用抽象双极集合基础论证框架（BSAFs）作为形式工具，分析强和弱可接受性及其语义在非平坦ABA中的表现。

Result: 证明了强和弱可接受性在非平坦ABA中保持模块化性质，但也揭示了其与传统可接受性类似的局限性。

Conclusion: 强和弱可接受性在ABA中具有研究价值，但需进一步解决其局限性。

Abstract: In this work, we broaden the investigation of admissibility notions in the
context of assumption-based argumentation (ABA). More specifically, we study
two prominent alternatives to the standard notion of admissibility from
abstract argumentation, namely strong and weak admissibility, and introduce the
respective preferred, complete and grounded semantics for general (sometimes
called non-flat) ABA. To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation
frameworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the
relations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general
non-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been
recently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions
cannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated
for ABA so far. We introduce strong admissibility for ABA and investigate
desirable properties. We furthermore extend the recent investigations of weak
admissibility in the flat ABA fragment to the non-flat case. We show that the
central modularization property is maintained under classical, strong, and weak
admissibility. We also show that strong and weakly admissible semantics in
non-flat ABA share some of the shortcomings of standard admissible semantics
and discuss ways to address these.

### [5] [Beyond Solving Math Quiz: Evaluating the Ability of Large Reasoning Models to Ask for Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11252)
*Youcheng Huang,Bowen Qin,Chen Huang,Duanyu Feng,Xi Yang,Wenqiang Lei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个新的数据集，用于评估大型推理模型（LRMs）在不完整问题上的表现，发现其在主动询问信息方面的不足，并揭示了其过度思考和幻觉行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅评估LRMs在定义明确问题上的表现，忽略了其在处理不完整问题时的主动性，这限制了其作为真正智能代理的能力。

Method: 作者构建了一个包含两种不完整问题的新数据集，并系统评估了LRMs的表现，同时探讨了监督微调在提升模型能力方面的潜力与挑战。

Result: 研究发现LRMs无法主动询问缺失信息，且存在过度思考和幻觉行为。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁开发更具真正智能的LRMs，而不仅仅是问题求解器。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving
abilities in mathematics, as evaluated by existing benchmarks exclusively on
well-defined problems. However, such evaluation setup constitutes a critical
gap, since a genuine intelligent agent should not only solve problems (as a
math quiz solver), but also be able~to ask for information when the problems
lack sufficient information, enabling proactivity in responding users'
requests. To bridge such gap, we proposes a new dataset consisting of two types
of incomplete problems with diverse contexts. Based on the dataset, our
systematical evaluation of LRMs reveals their inability in proactively asking
for information. In addition, we uncover the behaviors related to overthinking
and hallucination of LRMs, and highlight the potential and challenges of
supervised fine-tuning in learning such ability. We hope to provide new
insights in developing LRMs with genuine intelligence, rather than just solving
problems.

### [6] [SAGE: Scale-Aware Gradual Evolution for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11347)
*Yifei Li,Lingling Zhang,Hang Yan,Tianzhe Zhao,Zihan Ma,Muye Huang,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE是一个针对动态知识图谱嵌入的尺度感知渐进演化框架，通过自适应调整嵌入维度和动态蒸馏机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的知识图谱是动态演化的，现有方法未能充分考虑更新尺度的差异和系统评估，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: SAGE根据更新尺度确定嵌入维度并扩展嵌入空间，采用动态蒸馏机制平衡新旧知识的保留与整合。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，SAGE显著优于基线方法，MRR、H@1和H@10分别提升1.38%、1.25%和1.6%。

Conclusion: SAGE证明了自适应嵌入维度在动态知识图谱嵌入中的重要性，并提供了公开代码。

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods aim to represent entities
and relations in a low-dimensional space, primarily focusing on static graphs.
However, real-world KGs are dynamically evolving with the constant addition of
entities, relations and facts. To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several
continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to
efficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining
learned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world
scenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of
updates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In
this paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for
CKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on
the update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic
Distillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of
learned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive
experiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently
outperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR,
1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with
methods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal
performance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive
embedding dimensions in CKGE. The codes of SAGE are publicly available at:

### [7] [CRAFT-GUI: Curriculum-Reinforced Agent For GUI Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11360)
*Songqin Nong,Jingxuan Xu,Sheng Zhou,Jianfeng Chen,Xiaoxuan Tang,Tao Jiang,Wenhao Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出CRAFT-GUI框架，通过课程学习和细粒度奖励设计，解决了现有强化学习方法在GUI任务中忽略任务难度差异和奖励信号单一的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在GUI任务中忽视任务难度差异和奖励信号单一，限制了代理的学习效率和适应性。

Method: 提出基于GRPO的课程学习框架CRAFT-GUI，设计结合规则和模型评估的细粒度奖励函数。

Result: 在Android Control和内部基准测试中分别提升5.6%和10.3%，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合强化学习和课程学习在GUI交互任务中具有显著优势。

Abstract: As autonomous agents become adept at understanding and interacting with
graphical user interface (GUI) environments, a new era of automated task
execution is emerging. Recent studies have demonstrated that Reinforcement
Learning (RL) can effectively enhance agents' performance in dynamic
interactive GUI environments. However, these methods face two key limitations:
(1) they overlook the significant variation in difficulty across different GUI
tasks by treating the entire training data as a uniform set, which hampers the
agent's ability to adapt its learning process; and (2) most approaches collapse
task-specific nuances into a single, coarse reward, leaving the agent with a
uniform signal that yields inefficient policy updates. To address these
limitations, we propose CRAFT-GUI, a curriculum learning framework based on
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that explicitly accounts for the
varying difficulty across trajectories. To enable more fine-grained policy
optimization, we design a reward function that combines simple rule-based
signals with model-judged evaluation, providing richer and more nuanced
feedback during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art approaches,
outperforming them by 5.6% on public benchmarks Android Control and 10.3% on
our internal online benchmarks, respectively. These findings empirically
validate the effectiveness of integrating reinforcement learning with
curriculum learning in GUI interaction tasks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）代理在不确定供应链管理中的决策能力及其潜在偏见，并提出了AIM-Bench基准测试以评估其行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM代理在库存决策中的表现及其偏见，填补了该领域的空白。

Method: 通过AIM-Bench基准测试，设计多样化的库存补充实验，评估LLM代理的决策行为。

Result: 发现LLM代理存在类似人类的决策偏见，并探索了缓解策略（如认知反思和信息共享）。

Conclusion: 需谨慎考虑LLM在库存决策中的偏见，为开发以人为本的供应链决策支持系统提供启示。

Abstract: Recent advances in mathematical reasoning and the long-term planning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have precipitated the development
of agents, which are being increasingly leveraged in business operations
processes. Decision models to optimize inventory levels are one of the core
elements of operations management. However, the capabilities of the LLM agent
in making inventory decisions in uncertain contexts, as well as the
decision-making biases (e.g. framing effect, etc.) of the agent, remain largely
unexplored. This prompts concerns regarding the capacity of LLM agents to
effectively address real-world problems, as well as the potential implications
of biases that may be present. To address this gap, we introduce AIM-Bench, a
novel benchmark designed to assess the decision-making behaviour of LLM agents
in uncertain supply chain management scenarios through a diverse series of
inventory replenishment experiments. Our results reveal that different LLMs
typically exhibit varying degrees of decision bias that are similar to those
observed in human beings. In addition, we explored strategies to mitigate the
pull-to-centre effect and the bullwhip effect, namely cognitive reflection and
implementation of information sharing. These findings underscore the need for
careful consideration of the potential biases in deploying LLMs in Inventory
decision-making scenarios. We hope that these insights will pave the way for
mitigating human decision bias and developing human-centred decision support
systems for supply chains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inclusion Arena是一个实时排行榜，通过从AI应用收集的人类反馈对LLMs和MLLMs进行排名，解决了静态数据集和通用领域提示的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准和排行榜依赖静态数据集或通用领域提示，无法反映模型在真实应用中的表现，因此需要更贴近实际使用场景的评估方法。

Method: 平台通过自然用户交互中的成对模型比较收集反馈，并采用改进的Bradley-Terry模型进行排名，包括冷启动机制（Placement Matches）和智能比较策略（Proximity Sampling）。

Result: Inclusion Arena提供了可靠且稳定的排名，数据传递性优于通用众包数据集，并有效减少了恶意操纵的风险。

Conclusion: 通过连接基础模型和实际应用，Inclusion Arena旨在加速开发更贴近用户需求的LLMs和MLLMs。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have ushered in a new era of AI capabilities, demonstrating near-human-level
performance across diverse scenarios. While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU)
and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the
development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced
general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in
real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion
Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected
directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model
comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect
practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the
Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches,
a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated
models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that
prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize
information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and
simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable
rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced
datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By
fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world
applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and
MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments. The platform is
publicly accessible at https://doraemon.alipay.com/model-ranking.

*David H. Chan,Mark Roberts,Dana S. Nau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了概率性地标的概念，并将其应用于UCT算法中以分解MDP问题，通过平衡地标达成与最终目标达成来提升在线概率规划的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地标在经典规划中已有显著贡献，但在随机领域应用较少。本文旨在探索地标在随机规划中的潜力。

Method: 形式化概率性地标，并调整UCT算法以利用地标作为子目标分解MDP问题，核心在于平衡贪婪地标达成与长期目标达成。

Result: 在基准测试中，合理选择的地标显著提升了UCT算法的性能，但最佳平衡策略因问题而异。

Conclusion: 地标可以为解决MDP问题的随时算法提供有效指导。

Abstract: Landmarks$\unicode{x2013}$conditions that must be satisfied at some point in
every solution plan$\unicode{x2013}$have contributed to major advancements in
classical planning, but they have seldom been used in stochastic domains. We
formalize probabilistic landmarks and adapt the UCT algorithm to leverage them
as subgoals to decompose MDPs; core to the adaptation is balancing between
greedy landmark achievement and final goal achievement. Our results in
benchmark domains show that well-chosen landmarks can significantly improve the
performance of UCT in online probabilistic planning, while the best balance of
greedy versus long-term goal achievement is problem-dependent. The results
suggest that landmarks can provide helpful guidance for anytime algorithms
solving MDPs.

Motivation: 解决大规模规划问题中的状态空间爆炸问题，并探索如何结合LLM与领域知识以生成有效规划。

Method: 提出LLM辅助规划器，结合问题分解，使用LLM4Inspire（启发式引导）和LLM4Predict（领域知识推断）两种范式。

Result: 实验验证了规划器的有效性，LLM4Predict在修剪搜索空间时表现更优。

Conclusion: 结合领域知识的LLM（LLM4Predict）在大规模规划问题中更具潜力。

Abstract: Addressing large-scale planning problems has become one of the central
challenges in the planning community, deriving from the state-space explosion
caused by growing objects and actions. Recently, researchers have explored the
effectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate helpful
actions and states to prune the search space. However, prior works have largely
overlooked integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to ensure valid
plans. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-assisted planner integrated with
problem decomposition, which first decomposes large planning problems into
multiple simpler sub-tasks. Then we explore two novel paradigms to utilize
LLMs, i.e., LLM4Inspire and LLM4Predict, to assist problem decomposition, where
LLM4Inspire provides heuristic guidance according to general knowledge and
LLM4Predict employs domain-specific knowledge to infer intermediate conditions.
We empirically validate the effectiveness of our planner across multiple
domains, demonstrating the ability of search space partition when solving
large-scale planning problems. The experimental results show that LLMs
effectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where
infusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds
particular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge
within LLMs.

TL;DR: A2HCoder是一个基于大型语言模型的层次化算法到HDL编码代理，旨在解决算法设计与硬件实现之间的鸿沟，通过模块化和逐步翻译提高可靠性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信系统对超低延迟和功耗的严格要求，导致算法设计与硬件实现之间存在巨大差距，传统方法需要大量专业知识和手动开发。

Method: A2HCoder采用层次化框架，水平维度分解算法为模块化功能块，垂直维度逐步翻译并利用外部工具链（如MATLAB和Vitis HLS）调试和合成电路。

Result: 在5G无线通信领域的实际部署案例中验证了A2HCoder的实用性、可靠性和部署效率。

Conclusion: A2HCoder通过模块化和逐步翻译有效减少了LLM生成代码中的幻觉问题，提升了算法到硬件翻译的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, stringent requirements such as ultra-low
latency and power consumption have significantly increased the demand for
efficient algorithm-to-hardware deployment. However, a persistent and
substantial gap remains between algorithm design and hardware implementation.
Bridging this gap traditionally requires extensive domain expertise and
time-consuming manual development, due to fundamental mismatches between
high-level programming languages like MATLAB and hardware description languages
(HDLs) such as Verilog-in terms of memory access patterns, data processing
manners, and datatype representations. To address this challenge, we propose
A2HCoder: a Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Coding Agent, powered by large
language models (LLMs), designed to enable agile and reliable
algorithm-to-hardware translation. A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework
that enhances both robustness and interpretability while suppressing common
hallucination issues in LLM-generated code. In the horizontal dimension,
A2HCoder decomposes complex algorithms into modular functional blocks,
simplifying code generation and improving consistency. In the vertical
dimension, instead of relying on end-to-end generation, A2HCoder performs
step-by-step, fine-grained translation, leveraging external toolchains such as
MATLAB and Vitis HLS for debugging and circuit-level synthesis. This structured
process significantly mitigates hallucinations and ensures hardware-level
correctness. We validate A2HCoder through a real-world deployment case in the
5G wireless communication domain, demonstrating its practicality, reliability,
and deployment efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试缺乏自然且耗时的问题，无法全面评估模型在复杂信息查询任务中的表现。

Method: 通过分解标注流程，手动构建并回答大量自然耗时问题，形成MoNaCo基准。

Result: 前沿LLM在MoNaCo上的F1得分最高仅61.2%，主要受低召回率和幻觉问题影响。

Conclusion: MoNaCo为评估和改进LLM处理复杂信息查询任务提供了有效资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a go-to tool for querying
information. However, current LLM benchmarks rarely feature natural questions
that are both information-seeking as well as genuinely time-consuming for
humans. To address this gap we introduce MoNaCo, a benchmark of 1,315 natural
and complex questions that require dozens, and at times hundreds, of
intermediate steps to solve -- far more than any existing QA benchmark. To
build MoNaCo, we developed a decomposed annotation pipeline to elicit and
manually answer natural time-consuming questions at scale. Frontier LLMs
evaluated on MoNaCo achieve at most 61.2% F1, hampered by low recall and
hallucinations. Our results underscore the need for reasoning models that
better handle the complexity and sheer breadth of real-world
information-seeking questions -- with MoNaCo providing an effective resource
for tracking such progress. The MONACO benchmark, codebase, prompts and models
predictions are publicly available at: https://tomerwolgithub.github.io/monaco

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaTwin是一个多层次的提示条件框架，通过整合人口统计、行为和心理测量数据，构建自适应数字孪生，显著提升了LLM在用户建模中的多维度和公平性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在用户建模和人类行为模拟中存在多维度和公平性不足的问题，需要一种更精准的方法来捕捉用户的多维特征。

Method: 提出PersonaTwin框架，整合多维度数据，并通过医疗领域8,500多人的数据集进行系统评估，结合文本相似性和公平性指标。

Result: 实验表明，PersonaTwin在模拟保真度上接近理想设置，且基于其训练的模型在预测和公平性上与基于真实个体的模型表现相当。

Conclusion: PersonaTwin展示了LLM数字孪生在用户模拟中的潜力，为个性化用户建模和行为分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) afford new possibilities for user modeling
and approximation of human behaviors, they often fail to capture the
multidimensional nuances of individual users. In this work, we introduce
PersonaTwin, a multi-tier prompt conditioning framework that builds adaptive
digital twins by integrating demographic, behavioral, and psychometric data.
Using a comprehensive data set in the healthcare context of more than 8,500
individuals, we systematically benchmark PersonaTwin against standard LLM
outputs, and our rigorous evaluation unites state-of-the-art text similarity
metrics with dedicated demographic parity assessments, ensuring that generated
responses remain accurate and unbiased. Experimental results show that our
framework produces simulation fidelity on par with oracle settings. Moreover,
downstream models trained on persona-twins approximate models trained on

Abstract: Identifying risks associated with a company is important to investors and the
well-being of the overall financial market. In this study, we build a
computational framework to automatically extract company risk factors from news
articles. Our newly proposed schema comprises seven distinct aspects, such as
supply chain, regulations, and competitions. We sample and annotate 744 news
articles and benchmark various machine learning models. While large language
models have achieved huge progress in various types of NLP tasks, our
experiment shows that zero-shot and few-shot prompting state-of-the-art LLMs
(e.g. LLaMA-2) can only achieve moderate to low performances in identifying
risk factors. And fine-tuned pre-trained language models are performing better
on most of the risk factors. Using this model, we analyze over 277K Bloomberg
news articles and demonstrate that identifying risk factors from news could
provide extensive insight into the operations of companies and industries.

Conclusion: Rule2Text框架成功提升了KG规则的可解释性，并通过开源代码和数据促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) can be enhanced through rule mining; however, the
resulting logical rules are often difficult for humans to interpret due to
their inherent complexity and the idiosyncratic labeling conventions of
individual KGs. This work presents Rule2Text, a comprehensive framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language
explanations for mined logical rules, thereby improving KG accessibility and
usability. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple datasets, including
Freebase variants (FB-CVT-REV, FB+CVT-REV, and FB15k-237) as well as the
ogbl-biokg dataset, with rules mined using AMIE 3.5.1. We systematically
evaluate several LLMs across a comprehensive range of prompting strategies,
including zero-shot, few-shot, variable type incorporation, and
Chain-of-Thought reasoning. To systematically assess models' performance, we
conduct a human evaluation of generated explanations on correctness and
clarity. To address evaluation scalability, we develop and validate an
LLM-as-a-judge framework that demonstrates strong agreement with human
evaluators. Leveraging the best-performing model (Gemini 2.0 Flash), LLM judge,
and human-in-the-loop feedback, we construct high-quality ground truth
datasets, which we use to fine-tune the open-source Zephyr model. Our results
demonstrate significant improvements in explanation quality after fine-tuning,
with particularly strong gains in the domain-specific dataset. Additionally, we
integrate a type inference module to support KGs lacking explicit type
information. All code and data are publicly available at

Result: 实验显示MDMs在文本风格转换任务中表现优于自回归模型，且验证器方法显著提升生成质量。

Conclusion: MDMs结合验证器方法在离散数据生成中具有优势，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDMs) have recently gained traction as a
viable generative framework for natural language. This can be attributed to its
scalability and ease of training compared to other diffusion model paradigms
for discrete data, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art
non-autoregressive generator for discrete data. Diffusion models, in general,
have shown excellent ability to improve the generation quality by leveraging
inference-time scaling either by increasing the number of denoising steps or by
using external verifiers on top of the outputs of each step to guide the
generation. In this work, we propose a verifier-based inference-time scaling
method that aids in finding a better candidate generation during the denoising
process of the MDM. Our experiments demonstrate the application of MDMs for
standard text-style transfer tasks and establish MDMs as a better alternative
to autoregressive language models. Additionally, we show that a simple
soft-value-based verifier setup for MDMs using off-the-shelf pre-trained
embedding models leads to significant gains in generation quality even when
used on top of typical classifier-free guidance setups in the existing
literature.

Conclusion: 研究结果为推进以儿童为中心的AI设计和部署提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in applications
targeting children and adolescents necessitates a fundamental reassessment of
prevailing AI safety frameworks, which are largely tailored to adult users and
neglect the distinct developmental vulnerabilities of minors. This paper
highlights key deficiencies in existing LLM safety benchmarks, including their
inadequate coverage of age-specific cognitive, emotional, and social risks
spanning early childhood (ages 0--6), middle childhood (7--12), and adolescence
(13--18). To bridge these gaps, we introduce SproutBench, an innovative
evaluation suite comprising 1,283 developmentally grounded adversarial prompts
designed to probe risks such as emotional dependency, privacy violations, and
imitation of hazardous behaviors. Through rigorous empirical evaluation of 47
diverse LLMs, we uncover substantial safety vulnerabilities, corroborated by
robust inter-dimensional correlations (e.g., between Safety and Risk
Prevention) and a notable inverse relationship between Interactivity and Age
Appropriateness. These insights yield practical guidelines for advancing
child-centric AI design and deployment.

Conclusion: 通过控制实验揭示了预训练动态，为改进LLM的跨语言迁移提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with cross-lingual knowledge transfer:
they hallucinate when asked in one language about facts expressed in a
different language during training. This work introduces a controlled setting
to study the causes and dynamics of this phenomenon by training small
Transformer models from scratch on synthetic multilingual datasets. We identify
a learning phase wherein a model develops either separate or unified
representations of the same facts across languages, and show that unification
is essential for cross-lingual transfer. We also show that the degree of
unification depends on mutual information between facts and training data
language, and on how easy it is to extract that language. Based on these
insights, we develop methods to modulate the level of cross-lingual transfer by
manipulating data distribution and tokenization, and we introduce metrics and
visualizations to formally characterize their effects on unification. Our work
shows how controlled settings can shed light on pre-training dynamics and
suggests new directions for improving cross-lingual transfer in LLMs.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型代理在复杂搜索空间中制定计划的能力，尤其是在外部失败时是否能有效寻找替代方案。

Method: 设计了一个基于函数调用的规划基准测试，模拟外部失败（如函数不可用），并观察代理的适应能力。

Result: 语言模型代理难以根据环境反馈制定备用计划，即使搜索空间受限，其适应能力仍不足。

Conclusion: 当前生成模型在适应环境反馈方面存在挑战，未来工作需改进其灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: As language model agents are applied to real world problems of increasing
complexity, they will be expected to formulate plans across large search
spaces. If those plans fail for reasons beyond their control, how well do
language agents search for alternative ways to achieve their goals? We devise a
specialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning
problem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for
relevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes
environmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages. Our
benchmark confronts the agent with external failures in its workflow, such as
functions that suddenly become unavailable. At the same time, even with the
introduction of these failures, we guarantee that the task remains solvable.
Ideally, an agent's performance on the planning task should not be affected by
the presence of external failures. Overall, we find that language agents
struggle to formulate and execute backup plans in response to environment
feedback. While state-of-the-art models are often able to identify the correct
function to use in the right context, they struggle to adapt to feedback from
the environment and often fail to pursue alternate courses of action, even when
the search space is artificially restricted. We provide a systematic analysis
of the failures of both open-source and commercial models, examining the
effects of search space size, as well as the benefits of scaling model size in
our setting. Our analysis identifies key challenges for current generative
models as well as promising directions for future work.

Motivation: 大语言模型在下游任务中表现出偏见，尤其是在敏感话题上，现有技术虽已取得进展，但仍存在未充分探索的挑战。

Method: 结合极化敏感的情感指标和合成的平衡数据集，通过预定义的语义类别评估LLM的偏见。

Result: 在俄罗斯-乌克兰战争的案例中，发现模型普遍对乌克兰持更积极态度，但不同语义类别间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架支持自动化数据集生成和细粒度偏见评估，适用于多种极化驱动的场景和主题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to exhibit biases in downstream tasks,
especially when dealing with sensitive topics such as political discourse,
gender identity, ethnic relations, or national stereotypes. Although
significant progress has been made in bias detection and mitigation techniques,
certain challenges remain underexplored. This study proposes a reusable,
granular, and topic-agnostic framework to evaluate polarisation-related biases
in LLM (both open-source and closed-source). Our approach combines
polarisation-sensitive sentiment metrics with a synthetically generated
balanced dataset of conflict-related statements, using a predefined set of
semantic categories.
  As a case study, we created a synthetic dataset that focusses on the
Russia-Ukraine war, and we evaluated the bias in several LLMs: Llama-3,
Mistral, GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.0. Beyond aggregate bias scores, with
a general trend for more positive sentiment toward Ukraine, the framework
allowed fine-grained analysis with considerable variation between semantic
categories, uncovering divergent behavioural patterns among models. Adaptation
to prompt modifications showed further bias towards preconceived language and
citizenship modification.
  Overall, the framework supports automated dataset generation and fine-grained
bias assessment, is applicable to a variety of polarisation-driven scenarios
and topics, and is orthogonal to many other bias-evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enabled the development of AI
agents that can plan and interact with tools to complete complex tasks.
However, literature on their reliability in real-world applications remains
limited. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent framework for a marketing
task: audience curation. To solve this, we introduce a framework called RAMP
that iteratively plans, calls tools, verifies the output, and generates
suggestions to improve the quality of the audience generated. Additionally, we
equip the model with a long-term memory store, which is a knowledge base of
client-specific facts and past queries. Overall, we demonstrate the use of LLM
planning and memory, which increases accuracy by 28 percentage points on a set
of 88 evaluation queries. Moreover, we show the impact of iterative
verification and reflection on more ambiguous queries, showing progressively
better recall (roughly +20 percentage points) with more verify/reflect

Abstract: This paper presents MobQA, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for human
mobility data through natural language question answering.
  While existing models excel at predicting human movement patterns, it remains
unobvious how much they can interpret the underlying reasons or semantic
meaning of those patterns. MobQA provides a comprehensive evaluation framework
for LLMs to answer questions about diverse human GPS trajectories spanning
daily to weekly granularities. It comprises 5,800 high-quality question-answer
pairs across three complementary question types: factual retrieval (precise
data extraction), multiple-choice reasoning (semantic inference), and free-form
explanation (interpretive description), which all require spatial, temporal,
and semantic reasoning. Our evaluation of major LLMs reveals strong performance
on factual retrieval but significant limitations in semantic reasoning and
explanation question answering, with trajectory length substantially impacting
model effectiveness. These findings demonstrate the achievements and
limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs for semantic mobility

Conclusion: 该方法通过个性化干扰项生成，显著提升了诊断学生错误推理的能力，同时具有鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Distractors, incorrect but plausible answer choices in multiple-choice
questions (MCQs), play a critical role in educational assessment by diagnosing
student misconceptions. Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns
across large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to
capture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their
diagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of
personalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors
based on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past
question-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that
effectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task
is challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which
often lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based
group-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free
two-stage framework. In the first stage, we construct a student-specific
misconception prototype by applying Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to recover
the student's reasoning trajectories from past incorrect answers. In the second
stage, this prototype guides the simulation of the student's reasoning on new
questions, enabling the generation of personalized distractors that align with
the student's recurring misconceptions. Experiments show that our approach
achieves the best performance in generating plausible, personalized distractors
for 140 students, and also effectively generalizes to group-level settings,
highlighting its robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech-to-text translation have led to the development
of multilingual models capable of handling multiple language pairs
simultaneously. However, these unified models often suffer from large parameter

Whisper Medium model, we enhance it for multilingual speech translation into
whisperM2M, and integrate our novel KVSPN module, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across six popular languages with improved inference
efficiency. KVSPN enables a 40\% speedup with no BLEU score degradation.
Combined with distillation methods, it represents a 2.6$\times$ speedup over

Method: E-CaTCH通过聚类伪事件、跨模态注意力对齐和时间感知LSTM建模，结合自适应类别权重和硬样本挖掘。

Result: 在多个数据集上优于现有方法，表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: E-CaTCH在检测多模态虚假信息方面具有显著优势，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Detecting multimodal misinformation on social media remains challenging due
to inconsistencies between modalities, changes in temporal patterns, and
substantial class imbalance. Many existing methods treat posts independently
and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time
and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for
robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into
pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then
processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual
features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via
intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal
attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form
contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal
evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a
trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode
narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event
level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To
address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates
adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example
mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments
on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Cross-dataset evaluations
further demonstrate its robustness, generalizability, and practical
applicability across diverse misinformation scenarios.

TL;DR: HGRAG方法通过超图整合结构和语义信息，提升多跳问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法忽视知识间的结构关联，而GraphRAG方法过度依赖结构信息，导致语义利用不足。

Method: 构建实体超图，结合细粒度实体和粗粒度段落信息，设计超图检索方法，并通过检索增强模块优化结果。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，检索效率提升6倍。

Conclusion: HGRAG方法有效整合结构和语义信息，显著提升多跳问答任务性能。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) requires integrating knowledge scattered
across multiple passages to derive the correct answer. Traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained
textual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed
knowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods
address this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural
associations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and
fine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization
of textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called
HGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and
semantic information via hypergraphs. Structurally, we construct an entity
hypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained
passages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared
entities. Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates
fine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via
hypergraph diffusion. Finally, we employ a retrieval enhancement module, which
further refines the retrieved results both semantically and structurally, to
obtain the most relevant passages as context for answer generation with the
LLM. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in QA performance, and achieves a
6$\times$ speedup in retrieval efficiency.

TL;DR: LLMs在语言学谜题上表现不佳，尤其是在形态复杂性高的语言中，但通过预处理（如词素分割）可以提升表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在低资源语言中的语言学推理能力，揭示其弱点。

Method: 分析629个来自41种低资源语言的谜题，标注语言学特征，并测试预处理方法的效果。

Result: LLMs在形态复杂性高的谜题中表现差，但在与英语相似的特征上表现较好；词素分割预处理能提升表现。

Conclusion: LLMs在语言学推理和低资源语言建模中面临挑战，需改进语言特定的分词方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in reasoning tasks,
but their performance on linguistics puzzles remains consistently poor. These
puzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a
minimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning
abilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance
on 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with
linguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that
LLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and
perform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in
English. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing
step improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and
language-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some
challenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages.

Conclusion: LETToT为领域特定LLM评估提供了一种可扩展、无需标注的替代方案。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in specific domain like tourism
remains challenging due to the prohibitive cost of annotated benchmarks and
persistent issues like hallucinations. We propose $\textbf{L}$able-Free
$\textbf{E}$valuation of LLM on $\textbf{T}$ourism using Expert
$\textbf{T}$ree-$\textbf{o}$f-$\textbf{T}$hought (LETToT), a framework that
leverages expert-derived reasoning structures-instead of labeled data-to access
LLMs in tourism. First, we iteratively refine and validate hierarchical ToT
components through alignment with generic quality dimensions and expert
feedback. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our systematically optimized
expert ToT with 4.99-14.15\% relative quality gains over baselines. Second, we
apply LETToT's optimized expert ToT to evaluate models of varying scales
(32B-671B parameters), revealing: (1) Scaling laws persist in specialized
domains (DeepSeek-V3 leads), yet reasoning-enhanced smaller models (e.g.,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) close this gap; (2) For sub-72B models, explicit
reasoning architectures outperform counterparts in accuracy and conciseness
($p<0.05$). Our work established a scalable, label-free paradigm for
domain-specific LLM evaluation, offering a robust alternative to conventional
annotated benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至其他语言和安全关键任务，小型模型在毒性检测中表现优异。

Abstract: Detecting toxic content using language models is crucial yet challenging.
While substantial progress has been made in English, toxicity detection in
French remains underdeveloped, primarily due to the lack of culturally
relevant, large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce TOXIFRENCH, a new
public benchmark of 53,622 French online comments, constructed via a
semi-automated annotation pipeline that reduces manual labeling to only 10%
through high-confidence LLM-based pre-annotation and human verification. Then,
we benchmark a broad range of models and uncover a counterintuitive insight:
Small Language Models (SLMs) outperform many larger models in robustness and
generalization under the toxicity detection task. Motivated by this finding, we
propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy using a dynamic
weighted loss that progressively emphasizes the model's final decision,
significantly improving faithfulness. Our fine-tuned 4B model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving its F1 score by 13% over its baseline
and outperforming LLMs such as GPT-40 and Gemini-2.5. Further evaluation on a
cross-lingual toxicity benchmark demonstrates strong multilingual ability,
suggesting that our methodology can be effectively extended to other languages
and safety-critical classification tasks.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在心理健康问题回答中的情绪表达差异，以指导模型选择。

Result: 情绪表达以乐观、恐惧和悲伤为主，模型和问题类型显著影响情绪，人口统计特征影响较小。

Conclusion: 模型选择对心理健康应用至关重要，不同LLMs具有独特的情绪特征，可能显著影响用户体验。

Abstract: Depression, anxiety, and stress are widespread mental health concerns that
increasingly drive individuals to seek information from Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study investigates how eight LLMs (Claude Sonnet, Copilot, Gemini
Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Llama, Mixtral, and Perplexity) reply to twenty
pragmatic questions about depression, anxiety, and stress when those questions
are framed for six user profiles (baseline, woman, man, young, old, and
university student). The models generated 2,880 answers, which we scored for
sentiment and emotions using state-of-the-art tools. Our analysis revealed that
optimism, fear, and sadness dominated the emotional landscape across all
outputs, with neutral sentiment maintaining consistently high values.
Gratitude, joy, and trust appeared at moderate levels, while emotions such as
anger, disgust, and love were rarely expressed. The choice of LLM significantly
influenced emotional expression patterns. Mixtral exhibited the highest levels
of negative emotions including disapproval, annoyance, and sadness, while Llama
demonstrated the most optimistic and joyful responses. The type of mental
health condition dramatically shaped emotional responses: anxiety prompts
elicited extraordinarily high fear scores (0.974), depression prompts generated
elevated sadness (0.686) and the highest negative sentiment, while
stress-related queries produced the most optimistic responses (0.755) with
elevated joy and trust. In contrast, demographic framing of queries produced
only marginal variations in emotional tone. Statistical analyses confirmed
significant model-specific and condition-specific differences, while
demographic influences remained minimal. These findings highlight the critical
importance of model selection in mental health applications, as each LLM
exhibits a distinct emotional signature that could significantly impact user
experience and outcomes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SafeConstellations的方法，通过跟踪任务特定的轨迹模式，减少LLMs的过度拒绝行为，同时保持模型的一般性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的安全机制导致模型拒绝表面上类似有害内容的良性指令，降低了生产应用中的实用性。

Method: 通过嵌入空间中的轨迹分析，提出SafeConstellations方法，选择性引导模型行为。

Result: 该方法将过度拒绝率降低高达73%，且对实用性影响最小。

Conclusion: SafeConstellations提供了一种减少过度拒绝行为的有效方法，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: LLMs increasingly exhibit over-refusal behavior, where safety mechanisms
cause models to reject benign instructions that superficially resemble harmful
content. This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that
repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely
on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation).
Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse
responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to
appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow
distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations
traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift
predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce
SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks
task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal
pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to
over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces
over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a
principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.

Motivation: 由于现有评估方法存在偏见、缺乏人类偏好和过度依赖LLM作为评判标准的问题，需要一种更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出SGSimEval，通过整合大纲、内容和参考文献的评估，结合LLM评分与定量指标，并引入人类偏好指标。

Result: 实验表明，当前ASG系统在大纲生成上表现优异，但在内容和参考文献生成上仍有改进空间，评估指标与人类评估一致。

Conclusion: SGSimEval为ASG系统提供了多方面的评估框架，未来可进一步优化内容和参考文献生成。

Abstract: The growing interest in automatic survey generation (ASG), a task that
traditionally required considerable time and effort, has been spurred by recent
advances in large language models (LLMs). With advancements in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the rising popularity of multi-agent
systems (MASs), synthesizing academic surveys using LLMs has become a viable
approach, thereby elevating the need for robust evaluation methods in this
domain. However, existing evaluation methods suffer from several limitations,
including biased metrics, a lack of human preference, and an over-reliance on
LLMs-as-judges. To address these challenges, we propose SGSimEval, a
comprehensive benchmark for Survey Generation with Similarity-Enhanced
Evaluation that evaluates automatic survey generation systems by integrating
assessments of the outline, content, and references, and also combines
LLM-based scoring with quantitative metrics to provide a multifaceted
evaluation framework. In SGSimEval, we also introduce human preference metrics
that emphasize both inherent quality and similarity to humans. Extensive
experiments reveal that current ASG systems demonstrate human-comparable
superiority in outline generation, while showing significant room for
improvement in content and reference generation, and our evaluation metrics
maintain strong consistency with human assessments.

4-bit Group Scaling Quantization (GSQ) and Generative Pretrained Transformer
Quantization (GPTQ) to LLaMA 1B, Qwen 0.5B, and PHI 1.5B, evaluating their
impact across multiple NLP tasks. We benchmark these models on MS MARCO

(Mathematical Reasoning) datasets, assessing both accuracy and efficiency
across various tasks. The study measures the trade-offs between model
compression and task performance, analyzing key evaluation metrics, namely
accuracy, inference latency, and throughput (total output tokens generated per
second), providing insights into the suitability of low-bit quantization for
real-world deployment. Using the results, users can then make suitable
decisions based on the specifications that need to be met. We discuss the pros
and cons of GSQ and GPTQ techniques on models of different sizes, which also
serve as a benchmark for future experiments.

Conclusion: 信号处理技术为LLM生成文本检测提供了高效且可解释的新途径。

Abstract: The proliferation of high-quality text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
demands reliable and efficient detection methods. While existing training-free
approaches show promise, they often rely on surface-level statistics and
overlook fundamental signal properties of the text generation process. In this
work, we reframe detection as a signal processing problem, introducing a novel
paradigm that analyzes the sequence of token log-probabilities in the frequency
domain. By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the
global Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits
significantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the
larger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the
suppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text. Based on this key insight, we
construct SpecDetect, a detector built on a single, robust feature from the
global DFT: DFT total energy. We also propose an enhanced version,
SpecDetect++, which incorporates a sampling discrepancy mechanism to further
boost robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art model while running in nearly half the time.
Our work introduces a new, efficient, and interpretable pathway for
LLM-generated text detection, showing that classical signal processing
techniques offer a surprisingly powerful solution to this modern challenge.

Conclusion: 该方法为利用LLMs提取指标以生成透明反馈提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Automated feedback generation has the potential to enhance students' learning
progress by providing timely and targeted feedback. Moreover, it can assist
teachers in optimizing their time, allowing them to focus on more strategic and
personalized aspects of teaching. To generate high-quality, information-rich
formative feedback, it is essential first to extract relevant indicators, as
these serve as the foundation upon which the feedback is constructed. Teachers
often employ feedback criteria grids composed of various indicators that they
evaluate systematically. This study examines the initial phase of extracting
such indicators from students' submissions of a language learning course using
the large language model Llama 3.1. Accordingly, the alignment between
indicators generated by the LLM and human ratings across various feedback
criteria is investigated. The findings demonstrate statistically significant
strong correlations, even in cases involving unanticipated combinations of
indicators and criteria. The methodology employed in this paper offers a
promising foundation for extracting indicators from students' submissions using
LLMs. Such indicators can potentially be utilized to auto-generate explainable
and transparent formative feedback in future research.

Abstract: This technical report details a novel approach to combining reasoning and
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) within a single, lean language model
architecture. While existing RAG systems typically rely on large-scale models
and external APIs, our work addresses the increasing demand for performant and
privacy-preserving solutions deployable in resource-constrained or secure
environments. Building on recent developments in test-time scaling and
small-scale reasoning models, we develop a retrieval augmented conversational
agent capable of interpreting complex, domain-specific queries using a
lightweight backbone model. Our system integrates a dense retriever with
fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Instruct models, using synthetic query generation and
reasoning traces derived from frontier models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) over a
curated corpus, in this case, the NHS A-to-Z condition pages. We explore the
impact of summarisation-based document compression, synthetic data design, and
reasoning-aware fine-tuning on model performance. Evaluation against both
non-reasoning and general-purpose lean models demonstrates that our
domain-specific fine-tuning approach yields substantial gains in answer
accuracy and consistency, approaching frontier-level performance while
remaining feasible for local deployment. All implementation details and code
are publicly released to support reproducibility and adaptation across domains.

Abstract: Concurrent to the rapid progress in the development of neural-network based
models in areas like natural language processing and computer vision, the need
for creating explanations for the predictions of these black-box models has
risen steadily. We propose a new method to generate extractive explanations for
predictions made by neural networks, that is based on masking parts of the
input which the model does not consider to be indicative of the respective
class. The masking is done using gradient-based optimization combined with a
new regularization scheme that enforces sufficiency, comprehensiveness and
compactness of the generated explanation, three properties that are known to be
desirable from the related field of rationale extraction in natural language
processing. In this way, we bridge the gap between model interpretability and
rationale extraction, thereby proving that the latter of which can be performed
without training a specialized model, only on the basis of a trained
classifier. We further apply the same method to image inputs and obtain high
quality explanations for image classifications, which indicates that the
conditions proposed for rationale extraction in natural language processing are
more broadly applicable to different input types.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅简化了训练流程，还提升了模型的稳定性和性能，适用于生成类别相关的解释性评分。

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end differentiable training paradigm for stable training
of a rationalized transformer classifier. Our approach results in a single
model that simultaneously classifies a sample and scores input tokens based on
their relevance to the classification. To this end, we build on the widely-used
three-player-game for training rationalized models, which typically relies on
training a rationale selector, a classifier and a complement classifier. We
simplify this approach by making a single model fulfill all three roles,
leading to a more efficient training paradigm that is not susceptible to the
common training instabilities that plague existing approaches. Further, we
extend this paradigm to produce class-wise rationales while incorporating
recent advances in parameterizing and regularizing the resulting rationales,
thus leading to substantially improved and state-of-the-art alignment with
human annotations without any explicit supervision.

TL;DR: 通过微调大型语言模型（LLM）回答价值观调查问题，可以显著改变其在下游任务中的行为表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过简单方法（如微调）调整LLM的价值观系统，以影响其行为。

Method: 构建LLM的价值观基线，通过微调使其回答价值观调查问题，并评估其在域内和域外任务中的行为变化。

Result: 微调不仅能改变模型对调查问题的回答，还能显著影响其在情境化任务中的行为。

Conclusion: 简单微调方法可有效调整LLM的价值观系统，实现行为对齐。

Abstract: Large language models implicitly encode preferences over human values, yet
steering them often requires large training data. In this work, we investigate
a simple approach: Can we reliably modify a model's value system in downstream
behavior by training it to answer value survey questions accordingly? We first
construct value profiles of several open-source LLMs by asking them to rate a
series of value-related descriptions spanning 20 distinct human values, which
we use as a baseline for subsequent experiments. We then investigate whether
the value system of a model can be governed by fine-tuning on the value
surveys. We evaluate the effect of finetuning on the model's behavior in two
ways; first, we assess how answers change on in-domain, held-out survey
questions. Second, we evaluate whether the model's behavior changes in
out-of-domain settings (situational scenarios). To this end, we construct a
contextualized moral judgment dataset based on Reddit posts and evaluate
changes in the model's behavior in text-based adventure games. We demonstrate
that our simple approach can not only change the model's answers to in-domain
survey questions, but also produces substantial shifts (value alignment) in
implicit downstream task behavior.

*Shivam Dubey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HumorPlanSearch是一个模块化流程，通过多阶段建模上下文，提升AI生成幽默的质量和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大型语言模型生成的幽默常显得通用、重复或不合时宜，因为幽默依赖于文化背景和即时语境。

Method: 采用Plan-Search、Humor Chain-of-Thought模板、知识图谱、新颖性过滤和迭代修订循环，建模上下文。

Result: 实验显示，完整流程（知识图谱+修订）将幽默生成评分（HGS）平均提升15.4%。

Conclusion: HumorPlanSearch通过全流程上下文建模，推动AI幽默生成向更连贯、适应性强和文化敏感的方向发展。

Abstract: Automated humor generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
jokes that feel generic, repetitive, or tone-deaf because humor is deeply
situated and hinges on the listener's cultural background, mindset, and
immediate context. We introduce HumorPlanSearch, a modular pipeline that
explicitly models context through: (1) Plan-Search for diverse, topic-tailored
strategies; (2) Humor Chain-of-Thought (HuCoT) templates capturing cultural and
stylistic reasoning; (3) a Knowledge Graph to retrieve and adapt
high-performing historical strategies; (4) novelty filtering via semantic
embeddings; and (5) an iterative judge-driven revision loop. To evaluate
context sensitivity and comedic quality, we propose the Humor Generation Score
(HGS), which fuses direct ratings, multi-persona feedback, pairwise win-rates,
and topic relevance. In experiments across nine topics with feedback from 13
human judges, our full pipeline (KG + Revision) boosts mean HGS by 15.4 percent
(p < 0.05) over a strong baseline. By foregrounding context at every stage from
strategy planning to multi-signal evaluation, HumorPlanSearch advances
AI-driven humor toward more coherent, adaptive, and culturally attuned comedy.

### [46] [Online Anti-sexist Speech: Identifying Resistance to Gender Bias in Political Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11434)
*Aditi Dutta,Susan Banducci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在区分反性别歧视言论与性别歧视言论时的困难，发现模型常将反性别歧视言论误判为有害内容，尤其是在政治敏感事件中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动内容审核系统可能错误地将反性别歧视言论标记为有害，从而压制挑战性别歧视的声音，影响民主辩论。

Method: 研究分析了五种LLMs对英国政治推文的分类表现，重点关注2022年涉及女性议员的触发事件。

Result: 模型常将反性别歧视言论误判为有害，尤其在政治敏感事件中，导致边缘化声音被压制。

Conclusion: 内容审核需超越二元分类，整合人工审核，并在训练数据中明确包含反歧视言论，以保护数字政治空间中的抵抗言论。

Abstract: Anti-sexist speech, i.e., public expressions that challenge or resist
gendered abuse and sexism, plays a vital role in shaping democratic debate
online. Yet automated content moderation systems, increasingly powered by large
language models (LLMs), may struggle to distinguish such resistance from the
sexism it opposes. This study examines how five LLMs classify sexist,
anti-sexist, and neutral political tweets from the UK, focusing on
high-salience trigger events involving female Members of Parliament in the year
2022. Our analysis show that models frequently misclassify anti-sexist speech
as harmful, particularly during politically charged events where rhetorical
styles of harm and resistance converge. These errors risk silencing those who
challenge sexism, with disproportionate consequences for marginalised voices.
We argue that moderation design must move beyond binary harmful/not-harmful
schemas, integrate human-in-the-loop review during sensitive events, and
explicitly include counter-speech in training data. By linking feminist
scholarship, event-based analysis, and model evaluation, this work highlights
the sociotechnical challenges of safeguarding resistance speech in digital
political spaces.

*Bowen Zhang,Zixin Song,Chunquan Chen,Qian-Wen Zhang,Di Yin,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDiEmb框架通过任务专用目标、动态采样器和模型融合策略，解决了信息检索（IR）和语义文本相似性（STS）任务联合训练中的负迁移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联合训练IR和STS任务时，负迁移问题导致性能下降，需要系统化解耦任务特定学习信号。

Method: CoDiEmb采用任务专用目标、动态采样器、delta引导的模型融合策略和高效单阶段训练管道。

Result: 在15个基准测试中验证了CoDiEmb的有效性，不仅缓解了任务间权衡，还改善了嵌入空间的几何特性。

Conclusion: CoDiEmb为统一文本嵌入学习提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning unified text embeddings that excel across diverse downstream tasks
is a central goal in representation learning, yet negative transfer remains a
persistent obstacle. This challenge is particularly pronounced when jointly
training a single encoder for Information Retrieval (IR) and Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS), two essential but fundamentally disparate tasks for which
naive co-training typically yields steep performance trade-offs. We argue that
resolving this conflict requires systematically decoupling task-specific
learning signals throughout the training pipeline. To this end, we introduce
CoDiEmb, a unified framework that reconciles the divergent requirements of IR
and STS in a collaborative yet distinct manner. CoDiEmb integrates three key
innovations for effective joint optimization: (1) Task-specialized objectives
paired with a dynamic sampler that forms single-task batches and balances
per-task updates, thereby preventing gradient interference. For IR, we employ a
contrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by
cross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly
optimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion
strategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by
analyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization,
proving more effective than traditional Model Soups. (3) An efficient,
single-stage training pipeline that is simple to implement and converges
stably. Extensive experiments on 15 standard IR and STS benchmarks across three
base encoders validate CoDiEmb. Our results and analysis demonstrate that the
framework not only mitigates cross-task trade-offs but also measurably improves
the geometric properties of the embedding space.

### [48] [Reference Points in LLM Sentiment Analysis: The Role of Structured Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11454)
*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，结构化提示（如JSON格式）能提升小型语言模型在情感分析中的性能，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感分析研究多基于纯文本，而营销理论指出客户评价还受其他参考点影响，因此探讨补充信息的内容和格式对LLMs情感分析的影响。

Method: 比较自然语言和JSON格式提示，使用轻量级3B参数模型，在Yelp的餐厅和夜生活类别上进行实验。

Result: JSON提示优于基线，Macro-F1提升1.6%和4%，RMSE降低16%和9.1%。

Conclusion: 结构化提示使小型模型具备竞争力，为大规模模型部署提供实用替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used across many fields,
including marketing research. Sentiment analysis, in particular, helps firms
understand consumer preferences. While most NLP studies classify sentiment from
review text alone, marketing theories, such as prospect theory and
expectation--disconfirmation theory, point out that customer evaluations are
shaped not only by the actual experience but also by additional reference
points. This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such
supplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare
natural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B
parameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on
two Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with
additional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1
rises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it
deployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up
analysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning
rather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting
can enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a
practical alternative to large-scale model deployment.

### [49] [Speciesism in AI: Evaluating Discrimination Against Animals in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11534)
*Monika Jotautaitė,Lucius Caviola,David A. Brewster,Thilo Hagendorff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否表现出物种主义偏见，并评估其对非人类动物的价值观。通过三种范式分析，发现LLMs能识别物种主义言论但很少谴责，且在某些情况下优先人类而非动物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，研究其伦理倾向，特别是对非人类动物的偏见，对AI公平性和道德对齐至关重要。

Method: 采用三种方法：(1) SpeciesismBench基准测试；(2) 心理学测量比较模型与人类反应；(3) 文本生成任务分析物种主义合理化。

Result: LLMs能识别物种主义言论但很少谴责；在心理测量中表现复杂，有时优先人类；在文本生成中常合理化农场动物的伤害。

Conclusion: LLMs反映了人类主流观点，但也复制了动物剥削的文化规范。需扩展AI公平性框架以纳入非人类道德主体，减少物种主义偏见。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more widely deployed, it is crucial to
examine their ethical tendencies. Building on research on fairness and
discrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --
discrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human
animals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)
SpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral
evaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures
comparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation
tasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In
our benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely
condemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On
psychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower
explicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose
to save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that
LLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities
were equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described
as more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In
open-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized
harm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.
These findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and
mainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms
around animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment
frameworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for
reducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes
in AI systems and the societies they influence.

### [50] [Language models align with brain regions that represent concepts across modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11536)
*Maria Ryskina,Greta Tuckute,Alexander Fung,Ashley Malkin,Evelina Fedorenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了语言模型（LMs）与大脑对齐的关系，发现语言模型可能内部表征跨模态的概念意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知科学和神经科学长期面临区分语言表征与概念意义表征的挑战，语言模型中也存在类似问题。

Method: 通过两种神经指标（大脑激活水平和跨模态意义一致性）分析LM与大脑对齐的关系。

Result: 语言模型在意义一致性更强的脑区预测信号更准确，即使这些区域对语言处理不敏感。

Conclusion: 语言模型可能内部表征跨模态的概念意义。

Abstract: Cognitive science and neuroscience have long faced the challenge of
disentangling representations of language from representations of conceptual
meaning. As the same problem arises in today's language models (LMs), we
investigate the relationship between LM--brain alignment and two neural
metrics: (1) the level of brain activation during processing of sentences,
targeting linguistic processing, and (2) a novel measure of meaning consistency
across input modalities, which quantifies how consistently a brain region
responds to the same concept across paradigms (sentence, word cloud, image)
using an fMRI dataset (Pereira et al., 2018). Our experiments show that both
language-only and language-vision models predict the signal better in more
meaning-consistent areas of the brain, even when these areas are not strongly
sensitive to language processing, suggesting that LMs might internally
represent cross-modal conceptual meaning.

*Jinpeng Hu,Ao Wang,Qianqian Xie,Hui Ma,Zhuo Li,Dan Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多代理框架的心理健康评估方法，模拟医患对话，通过自适应提问和树状记忆结构提升评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理健康评估依赖专业人员且静态文本分析能力有限，无法捕捉动态交互中的深层信息。

Method: 采用多代理框架，包括提问、评估、评分和更新代理，结合自适应提问机制和树状记忆结构。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态交互和记忆更新，显著提升了心理健康评估的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Mental health assessment is crucial for early intervention and effective
treatment, yet traditional clinician-based approaches are limited by the
shortage of qualified professionals. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
have sparked growing interest in automated psychological assessment, yet most
existing approaches are constrained by their reliance on static text analysis,
limiting their ability to capture deeper and more informative insights that
emerge through dynamic interaction and iterative questioning. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework for mental health evaluation
that simulates clinical doctor-patient dialogues, with specialized agents
assigned to questioning, adequacy evaluation, scoring, and updating. We
introduce an adaptive questioning mechanism in which an evaluation agent
assesses the adequacy of user responses to determine the necessity of
generating targeted follow-up queries to address ambiguity and missing
information. Additionally, we employ a tree-structured memory in which the root
node encodes the user's basic information, while child nodes (e.g., topic and
statement) organize key information according to distinct symptom categories
and interaction turns. This memory is dynamically updated throughout the
interaction to reduce redundant questioning and further enhance the information
extraction and contextual tracking capabilities. Experimental results on the
DAIC-WOZ dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which
achieves better performance than existing approaches.

TL;DR: DR. SAF框架通过动态调整推理深度，显著提升大语言模型的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统长链思维推理方法存在冗余问题，且依赖人工定义的难度先验，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出DR. SAF框架，包含边界自感知对齐、自适应奖励管理和边界保护机制。

Result: 实验显示，DR. SAF减少49.27%的响应token，效率提升6.59倍，训练时间减少5倍。

Conclusion: DR. SAF在资源受限环境下表现优异，甚至能在极端训练中超越传统模型。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved
their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy,
impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time
applications. To improve the efficiency, current methods often rely on
human-defined difficulty priors, which do not align with the LLM's self-awared
difficulty, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic
Reasoning-Boundary Self-Awareness Framework (DR. SAF), which enables models to
dynamically assess and adjust their reasoning depth in response to problem
complexity. DR. SAF integrates three key components: Boundary Self-Awareness
Alignment, Adaptive Reward Management, and a Boundary Preservation Mechanism.
These components allow models to optimize their reasoning processes, balancing
efficiency and accuracy without compromising performance. Our experimental
results demonstrate that DR. SAF achieves a 49.27% reduction in total response
tokens with minimal loss in accuracy. The framework also delivers a 6.59x gain
in token efficiency and a 5x reduction in training time, making it well-suited
to resource-limited settings. During extreme training, DR. SAF can even surpass
traditional instruction-based models in token efficiency with more than 16%
accuracy improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AuriStream是一个受生物启发的两阶段语音编码模型，通过模拟人类听觉处理层次结构，实现了高效的语音表示学习和任务处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发更接近人类听觉处理的语音模型，以高效处理多样化的语音任务。

Method: 第一阶段将原始音频转换为基于人类耳蜗的时频表示，提取离散的耳蜗标记；第二阶段对耳蜗标记应用自回归序列模型。

Result: AuriStream在SUPERB语音任务中表现优异，能够学习有意义的音素和词汇表示，并生成可解码的音频延续。

Conclusion: AuriStream的两阶段框架为语音表示学习提供了新思路，推动了更接近人类听觉的模型发展。

Abstract: We introduce AuriStream, a biologically inspired model for encoding speech
via a two-stage framework inspired by the human auditory processing hierarchy.
The first stage transforms raw audio into a time-frequency representation based
on the human cochlea, from which we extract discrete \textbf{cochlear tokens}.
The second stage applies an autoregressive sequence model over the cochlear
tokens. AuriStream learns meaningful phoneme and word representations, and
state-of-the-art lexical semantics. AuriStream shows competitive performance on
diverse downstream SUPERB speech tasks. Complementing AuriStream's strong
representational capabilities, it generates continuations of audio which can be
visualized in a spectrogram space and decoded back into audio, providing
insights into the model's predictions. In summary, we present a two-stage
framework for speech representation learning to advance the development of more
human-like models that efficiently handle a range of speech-based tasks.

TL;DR: 提出并验证了一种新的合成数据集用于训练视觉蕴含模型，基于SNLI数据集生成图像，实验表明合成数据在数据稀缺时是可行的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉蕴含数据集规模小且稀疏，手动创建成本高，需要一种高效的数据生成方法。

Method: 利用SNLI文本前提通过Stable Diffusion生成图像，构建合成数据集，并通过CLIP特征向量训练视觉蕴含分类器进行评估。

Result: 合成数据在SNLI-VE和SICK-VTE数据集上仅导致F-score轻微下降（0.686 vs 0.703；0.384 vs 0.400）。

Conclusion: 合成数据在数据稀缺时是训练视觉蕴含模型的有效替代方案。

Abstract: In this paper we present and validate a new synthetic dataset for training
visual entailment models. Existing datasets for visual entailment are small and
sparse compared to datasets for textual entailment. Manually creating datasets
is labor-intensive. We base our synthetic dataset on the SNLI dataset for
textual entailment. We take the premise text from SNLI as input prompts in a
generative image model, Stable Diffusion, creating an image to replace each
textual premise. We evaluate our dataset both intrinsically and extrinsically.
For extrinsic evaluation, we evaluate the validity of the generated images by
using them as training data for a visual entailment classifier based on CLIP
feature vectors. We find that synthetic training data only leads to a slight
drop in quality on SNLI-VE, with an F-score 0.686 compared to 0.703 when
trained on real data. We also compare the quality of our generated training
data to original training data on another dataset: SICK-VTE. Again, there is
only a slight drop in F-score: from 0.400 to 0.384. These results indicate that
in settings with data sparsity, synthetic data can be a promising solution for
training visual entailment models.

Motivation: 解决视线数据在跨会话使用中的隐私问题，防止用户被重新识别，同时确保数据仍可用于良性任务。

Result: 显著降低生物识别可能性，同时实用性损失最小，且保留生理学上合理的视线模式。

Conclusion: 该机制为视线数据隐私保护提供了一种实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a privacy-enhancing mechanism for gaze signals using a
latent-noise autoencoder that prevents users from being re-identified across
play sessions without their consent, while retaining the usability of the data
for benign tasks. We evaluate privacy-utility trade-offs across biometric
identification and gaze prediction tasks, showing that our approach
significantly reduces biometric identifiability with minimal utility
degradation. Unlike prior methods in this direction, our framework retains
physiologically plausible gaze patterns suitable for downstream use, which
produces favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work advances privacy in
gaze-based systems by providing a usable and effective mechanism for protecting
sensitive gaze data.

Result: 总结了VTG-MLLMs的竞争性能、泛化能力及实证发现，并讨论了数据集与评估协议。

Conclusion: 指出了现有局限性，并提出了未来研究方向，如改进训练范式和视频特征处理。

Abstract: The recent advancement in video temporal grounding (VTG) has significantly
enhanced fine-grained video understanding, primarily driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). With superior multimodal comprehension and reasoning
abilities, VTG approaches based on MLLMs (VTG-MLLMs) are gradually surpassing
traditional fine-tuned methods. They not only achieve competitive performance
but also excel in generalization across zero-shot, multi-task, and multi-domain
settings. Despite extensive surveys on general video-language understanding,
comprehensive reviews specifically addressing VTG-MLLMs remain scarce. To fill
this gap, this survey systematically examines current research on VTG-MLLMs
through a three-dimensional taxonomy: 1) the functional roles of MLLMs,
highlighting their architectural significance; 2) training paradigms, analyzing
strategies for temporal reasoning and task adaptation; and 3) video feature
processing techniques, which determine spatiotemporal representation
effectiveness. We further discuss benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and
summarize empirical findings. Finally, we identify existing limitations and
propose promising research directions. For additional resources and details,

Motivation: 现有方法（如CFG、NASA和NAG）在负提示引导方面存在不足，VSF旨在以低计算开销动态抑制不需要的内容。

Method: VSF通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号实现动态抑制，适用于MMDiT架构和基于交叉注意力的模型。

Result: 实验表明，VSF在少步模型中显著优于现有方法，甚至在非少步模型中优于CFG，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: VSF是一种高效且通用的负提示引导方法，适用于多种模型和任务。

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for
incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching
image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by
flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method
requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with
MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as
cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets
with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static
image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF
significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in
few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining
competitive image quality. Code and ComfyUI node are available in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于相机姿态自动编码器（PAE）的相对姿态回归（RPR）方法，用于改进单图像绝对姿态回归（APR）的定位精度，无需额外存储图像或姿态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代零售环境中，精确的相机定位对提升客户体验、优化库存管理和实现自主操作至关重要。现有APR方法虽有效，但结合视觉和空间场景先验的方法通常精度更高。

Method: 扩展PAE至RPR任务，提出一种新的重定位方案，利用PAE-based RPR优化APR预测，无需额外数据存储。

Result: 实验表明，PAE-based RPR优于同等架构的图像RPR模型，且其优化策略显著提升了室内基准测试中的APR定位精度。仅需30%数据训练即可达到竞争性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过PAE-based RPR显著提升了APR的定位精度，同时减少了数据收集负担，适用于零售场景部署。

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for modern retail environments,
enabling enhanced customer experiences, streamlined inventory management, and
autonomous operations. While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image
offers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial
scene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy. Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs)
have recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we
extend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel
re-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR,
without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce
PAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based
RPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement
strategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on
indoor benchmarks. Notably, our method is shown to achieve competitive
performance even when trained with only 30% of the data, substantially reducing
the data collection burden for retail deployment. Our code and pre-trained
models are available at: https://github.com/yolish/camera-pose-auto-encoders

TL;DR: ViPE是一种高效视频处理引擎，用于从无约束视频中估计相机参数和深度图，显著优于现有基线，并支持多种场景和相机模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从野外视频中获取一致且精确的3D注释的挑战，推动空间AI系统的发展。

Method: ViPE通过高效算法估计相机内参、相机运动和密集深度图，适用于多种场景和相机模型。

Result: 在TUM/KITTI序列上性能提升18%/50%，处理速度达3-5FPS，并标注了大规模视频数据集。

Conclusion: ViPE及其标注数据集的开源将加速空间AI系统的开发。

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide
range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on
large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from
in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a
handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE
efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric
depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios,
including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports
various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360{\deg} panoramas. We
have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing
uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and
runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to
annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around
100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K
panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with
accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the
annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统封闭式3D检测框架无法满足开放世界应用需求，现有开放词汇方法在几何精度上存在不足。

Method: 提出HQ-OV3D框架，包含IMCV提案生成器和ACA去噪器，利用跨模态几何一致性和标注类几何先验优化伪标签。

Result: 相比现有方法，mAP提升7.37%，伪标签质量显著提高。

Conclusion: HQ-OV3D可作为独立检测器或插件生成高质量伪标签，适用于开放词汇检测流程。

Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of
open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D
detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of
pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language
models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of
pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision,
remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality
Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and
refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework
comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal
Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate
high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA)
Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors
from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to
the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our
approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating
the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D
can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also
as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary
detection or annotation pipelines.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉方法在3D语义占用预测中因依赖密集3D体素或2D平面特征而导致的高通信成本或深度估计需求问题。

Method: 利用稀疏3D语义高斯泼溅技术，通过共享和融合高斯基元，实现跨代理的去重和噪声抑制，同时结合几何与语义编码。

Result: 在mIoU和IoU指标上分别比单代理感知和基线协作方法提升了8.42/3.28和5.11/22.41分，通信量减少至34.6%时仍保持性能优势。

Conclusion: 该方法在协作感知中表现出色，尤其在通信资源有限的情况下仍能保持高性能。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information,
overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in
single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D
semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur
high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth
estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to
collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first
approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D
semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian
primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based
cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent
Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which
reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and
sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while
reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods
by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU,
respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our
method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6%
communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited
communication budgets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的面部超分辨率方法IDFSR，通过身份解耦和拟合技术，在极端退化场景下显著提升身份一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在极端退化（如8倍以上缩放）下难以恢复真实且身份一致的面部图像，容易产生幻觉效果。

Method: IDFSR采用三种关键设计：1）掩码低分辨率图像中的面部区域；2）对齐参考图像以提供风格指导；3）利用真实图像的ID嵌入进行细粒度建模。

Result: 实验表明，IDFSR在极端退化条件下显著优于现有方法，尤其在身份一致性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: IDFSR通过身份解耦和拟合技术，有效解决了极端退化场景下的面部超分辨率问题。

Abstract: In recent years, face super-resolution (FSR) methods have achieved remarkable
progress, generally maintaining high image fidelity and identity (ID)
consistency under standard settings. However, in extreme degradation scenarios
(e.g., scale $> 8\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often
severely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models
to reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to
generate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images
lacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
FSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID
restoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.
Our approach involves three key designs: 1) \textbf{Masking} the facial region
in the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)
\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style
guidance; 3) Leveraging \textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)
images for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first
pretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing
it to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity
embeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform
lightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID
images. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID
information, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual
quality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate
that the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under
extreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID
consistency.

Abstract: Accurate identification of wood species plays a critical role in ecological

Traditional classification approaches relying on macroscopic and microscopic
inspection are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge. In this study, we
explore the application of deep learning to automate the classification of ten
wood species commonly found in Vietnam. A custom image dataset was constructed
from field-collected wood samples, and five state-of-the-art convolutional
neural network architectures--ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileViT, MobileNetV3,
and ShuffleNetV2--were evaluated. Among these, ShuffleNetV2 achieved the best
balance between classification performance and computational efficiency, with
an average accuracy of 99.29\% and F1-score of 99.35\% over 20 independent
runs. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight deep learning
models for real-time, high-accuracy species identification in
resource-constrained environments. Our work contributes to the growing field of
ecological informatics by providing scalable, image-based solutions for
automated wood classification and forest biodiversity assessment.

Abstract: This paper presents NIRMAL Pooling, a novel pooling layer for Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) that integrates adaptive max pooling with non-linear
activation function for image classification tasks. The acronym NIRMAL stands
for Non-linear Activation, Intermediate Aggregation, Reduction, Maximum,
Adaptive, and Localized. By dynamically adjusting pooling parameters based on
desired output dimensions and applying a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation post-pooling, NIRMAL Pooling improves robustness and feature
expressiveness. We evaluated its performance against standard Max Pooling on
three benchmark datasets: MNIST Digits, MNIST Fashion, and CIFAR-10. NIRMAL
Pooling achieves test accuracies of 99.25% (vs. 99.12% for Max Pooling) on
MNIST Digits, 91.59% (vs. 91.44%) on MNIST Fashion, and 70.49% (vs. 68.87%) on
CIFAR-10, demonstrating consistent improvements, particularly on complex

performance in diverse image recognition tasks, offering a flexible and
reliable alternative to traditional pooling methods.

Method: 提出了一种新的特征描述符（形状方向直方图），用于描述Artcodes的通用拓扑结构，并构建了Artcode检测系统。

Result: 实验结果表明，该特征描述符能有效表示拓扑结构，检测系统性能良好。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于特征的拓扑对象检测系统提供了初步尝试，有望拓展新的交互机会和应用场景。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of smartphones and resurgence of VR/AR techniques, it
is expected that our everyday environment may soon be decorating with objects
connecting with virtual elements. Alerting to the presence of these objects is
therefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and
triggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a
special kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and
machine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform
appearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this
problem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection,
a distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but
geometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with
this problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of
orientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an
Artcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate
the performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature
vector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature
vector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the
system for detecting Artcode proposals. Although this work is an initial
attempt to develop a feature-based system for detecting topological objects
like Artcodes, it would open up new interaction opportunities and spark
potential applications of topological object detection.

Conclusion: 该方法为从工业CT数据中提取关键几何特征提供了可靠途径，并为复合材料预成型体的逆向建模和描述符分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: A detailed understanding of material structure across multiple scales is
essential for predictive modeling of textile-reinforced composites. Nesting --
characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local
interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining
mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance.
This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile
reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT).
In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking
configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\mu$m per voxel resolution. A
tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill
phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of
50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822
and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using
the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction
of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong
agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust
approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT
data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based
structural analysis of composite preforms.

Abstract: Potholes on the roads are a serious hazard and maintenance burden. This poses
a significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the
diverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a
complete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection,
Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using
OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000
frames captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather
scenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This
dataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to
perform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character

frames. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected
potholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and
frames as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly
web interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under
challenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road
assessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the

Conclusion: IPG在对抗性补丁防御和实际应用（如自动驾驶、安防系统、医学影像）中具有潜力，能提升AI模型在动态高风险环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

<details>

Motivation: 当前VQA基准测试在对象属性推理上存在局限性，缺乏多样性和复杂性，需要更系统的评估框架。

Method: 设计了包含三种图像类型、三种推理复杂度和四种对象属性的基准测试ORBIT，包含360张图像和1,080个问题。

Result: 12种先进VLM在零样本设置下表现不佳，最佳模型准确率仅40%，尤其在真实图像和复杂推理上表现较差。

Conclusion: ORBIT揭示了VLM的局限性，呼吁开发更可扩展的基准测试和推理方法。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress on many
popular visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, it remains unclear whether
they abstract and reason over depicted objects. Inspired by human object
categorisation, object property reasoning involves identifying and recognising
low-level details and higher-level abstractions. While current VQA benchmarks
consider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically
blend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of
reasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic
evaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning
levels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by
prior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this
benchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object
properties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based
questions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings
reveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing
model only reaching 40\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic
(photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional
properties, and higher counts. ORBIT points to the need to develop methods for
scalable benchmarking, generalize annotation guidelines, and explore additional
reasoning VLMs. We make the ORBIT benchmark and the experimental code available
to support such endeavors.

Result: 基准测试显示现有多模态模型在多阶段临床推理中存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: MedAtlas为开发稳健可信的医疗AI提供了具有挑战性的评估平台。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical
decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse
real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a
major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited
to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image
integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive
nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce
MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language
models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four
key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction,
multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core
tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn
question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease
diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates
temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging
modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to
perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas
provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose
two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation
Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal
substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas
establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of
robust and trustworthy medical AI.

Conclusion: FastFOD-Net有望加速临床神经科学研究，提升扩散MRI分析的可靠性和临床信任度。

Abstract: Fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is an advanced diffusion MRI modeling
technique that represents complex white matter fiber configurations, and a key
step for subsequent brain tractography and connectome analysis. Its reliability
and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and
the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs
from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and
low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially
be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement
techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been
assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their
clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement
framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders.
This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with
superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical
use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most
comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential
of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering
diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability
in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample
size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread
adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for
diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of
real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with
high-quality research acquisitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在无障碍领域的模拟能力，填补了低视力人群视觉感知模拟的研究空白。

Method: 通过调查40名低视力参与者收集数据，构建提示让VLMs模拟参与者，并评估模拟结果与原始回答的一致性。

Result: VLMs在仅提供部分信息时模拟准确性较低（0.59），结合视力信息和示例图像响应后显著提高（0.70）。

Conclusion: 结合多种信息能有效提升VLMs模拟低视力人群视觉感知的准确性，但额外示例效果有限。

Abstract: Advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled the simulation of
general human behavior through their reasoning and problem solving
capabilities. However, prior research has not investigated such simulation
capabilities in the accessibility domain. In this paper, we evaluate the extent
to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when
interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey
study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed
vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and
recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct
prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant,
varying the included information on vision information and example image
responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and
participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer
beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in
low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants'
responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example
image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both
significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single
example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers
significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while
additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).

Abstract: By integrating the perception capabilities of multimodal encoders with the
generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, have achieved great success in various
multimodal tasks, pointing toward a promising pathway to artificial general
intelligence. Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data,
poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation
protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs
across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external
tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with
external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a
promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance.
Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools:
(1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality
multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on
challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate
evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of
tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the
transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities,
offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于高光谱成像（HSI）的方法，通过选择信息量最大的波段来减少视觉模糊（metamerism），从而提高对弱势道路使用者（VRU）的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决汽车感知系统在RGB图像中因视觉模糊（metamerism）导致的弱势道路使用者（VRU）识别困难问题。

Method: 结合信息论技术（联合互信息最大化、相关性分析）和图像质量指标（对比信噪比），提出一种波段选择策略，从高光谱数据中筛选最具信息量的波段。

Result: 在H-City数据集上，选定的三个波段（497 nm、607 nm、895 nm）显著提高了VRU与背景的区分度，性能指标提升70.24%至1206.83%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化光谱输入，显著减少了视觉模糊，为高级驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）和自动驾驶（AD）提供了更可靠的感知基础，从而提升道路安全。

Abstract: Protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) is a critical safety challenge for
automotive perception systems, particularly under visual ambiguity caused by
metamerism, a phenomenon where distinct materials appear similar in RGB
imagery. This work investigates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to overcome this
limitation by capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum,
especially in the Near-Infrared (NIR). To manage the inherent
high-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that
integrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information
maximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image
quality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally
informative bands. Using the Hyperspectral City V2 (H-City) dataset, we
identify three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm, $\pm$27 nm) and
reconstruct pseudo-color images for comparison with co-registered RGB.
Quantitative results demonstrate increased dissimilarity and perceptual
separability of VRU from the background. The selected HSI bands yield
improvements of 70.24%, 528.46%, 1206.83%, and 246.62% for dissimilarity
(Euclidean, SAM, $T^2$) and perception (CIE $\Delta E$) metrics, consistently
outperforming RGB and confirming a marked reduction in metameric confusion. By
providing a spectrally optimized input, our method enhances VRU separability,
establishing a robust foundation for downstream perception tasks in Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), ultimately
contributing to improved road safety.

*Zixiang Yang,Yue Ma,Yinhan Zhang,Shanhui Mo,Dongrui Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVCtrl是一种轻量级控制适配器，通过时空双缓存策略减少冗余计算，显著提升图像和视频生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ControlNet）在可控生成中存在计算冗余和延迟问题，尤其在视频生成中更为明显。

Method: 提出时空双缓存策略：空间上分区处理控制信号，时间上选择性跳过不必要的去噪步骤。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现2倍以上的速度提升，且生成质量几乎无下降。

Conclusion: EVCtrl无需重新训练模型即可高效实现可控生成，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training
probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful
content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling,
practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise
specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants
precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases
latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and
denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce
EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead
without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual
caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we
first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained
control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A
locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the
control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.
For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to
improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,
Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image
and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it
achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and
Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation
quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

Motivation: 当前缺乏开放数据集来全面评估和优化VLMs在建筑安全检查中的应用，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 构建了一个包含图像描述、安全违规视觉问答（VQA）和建筑元素视觉定位三个任务的数据集，并评估了现有VLMs的零样本和少样本表现。

Result: 现有VLMs在零样本和少样本设置下表现出一定的泛化能力，但仍需额外训练以适应实际工地场景。

Conclusion: ConstructionSite 10k数据集为研究者提供了训练和评估新VLMs架构和技术的基准，推动了建筑安全检查领域的发展。

Abstract: Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector
identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language
Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting
safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open
datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction
safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets,
limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In
this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction
site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image
captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and
construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current
state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make
them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers
to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques,
providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.

Abstract: Document fraud poses a significant threat to industries reliant on secure and
verifiable documentation, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study
investigates the efficacy of state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models
(LLMs)-including OpenAI O1, OpenAI 4o, Gemini Flash (thinking), Deepseek Janus,
Grok, Llama 3.2 and 4, Qwen 2 and 2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, and Claude 3.5 and
3.7 Sonnet-in detecting fraudulent documents. We benchmark these models against
each other and prior work on document fraud detection techniques using a
standard dataset with real transactional documents. Through prompt optimization
and detailed analysis of the models' reasoning processes, we evaluate their
ability to identify subtle indicators of fraud, such as tampered text,
misaligned formatting, and inconsistent transactional sums. Our results reveal
that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot
generalization, outperforming conventional methods on out-of-distribution
datasets, while several vision LLMs exhibit inconsistent or subpar performance.
Notably, model size and advanced reasoning capabilities show limited
correlation with detection accuracy, suggesting task-specific fine-tuning is
critical. This study underscores the potential of multi-modal LLMs in enhancing
document fraud detection systems and provides a foundation for future research
into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: MICC方法有效且具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing rumor detection methods often neglect the content within images as
well as the inherent relationships between contexts and images across different
visual scales, thereby resulting in the loss of critical information pertinent
to rumor identification. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel
cross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the
Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC).
Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic
embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive
pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product
similarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is
introduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics,
guided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck
principle, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance
matrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a
scale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated
multi-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive
weights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal
relevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two
real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a
substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches
in rumor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for practical
applications.

TL;DR: MedSAMix是一种无需训练的模型融合方法，结合通用模型（如SAM）和专业模型（如MedSAM）的优势，用于医学图像分割，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在通用性方面存在局限性，尤其是数据异质性、标注稀缺和分布偏移等问题，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 提出一种零阶优化方法，自动发现最优的层间融合方案，并通过单任务优化和多目标优化两种机制满足不同临床需求。

Result: 在25个医学分割任务上，MedSAMix显著减少了模型偏差，专业任务和多任务评估分别提升了6.67%和4.37%。

Conclusion: MedSAMix通过融合通用和专业模型的优势，有效提升了医学图像分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation models have emerged as a promising
paradigm due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks, showing
great potential for a wide range of clinical applications. This potential has
been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various
fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned
variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data
that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional
shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range
of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a
training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both
generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical
image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that
rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we
propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal
layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we
develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and
generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and
multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical
segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias
and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and
generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37%
on multi-task evaluations.

Motivation: 现有方法在视频质量评估中存在结果不精确和损失计算低效的问题，限制了模型对关键指标的关注。

Method: 提出IOVQA，通过整数标签（范围[10,50]）和目标掩码策略（仅暴露标签的前两位整数）优化模型训练。

Result: 实验表明，IOVQA显著提升了模型在VQA任务中的准确性和一致性，在VQualA 2025挑战赛中排名第三。

Conclusion: 整数标签微调在定量评估场景中优化VLM的有效性，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vision language models(VLM), their ability to
assess visual content based on specific criteria and dimensions has become
increasingly critical for applications such as video-theme consistency
assessment and visual quality scoring. However, existing methods often suffer
from imprecise results and inefficient loss calculation, which limit the focus
of the model on key evaluation indicators. To address this, we propose
IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to
enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation
of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation
mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's
output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability,
and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also
introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first
two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the
critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the
Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's
accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025
GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I. Our work
highlights the effectiveness of merely leaving integer labels during
fine-tuning, providing an effective idea for optimizing VLMs in quantitative
evaluation scenarios.

TL;DR: MV-ScanQA和TripAlign数据集解决了现有3D视觉语言数据集的局限性，通过多视角推理和丰富的多对象对齐信号，提升了3D场景理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D VL数据集在远距离对象和多视角推理方面存在不足，限制了模型的深度场景理解能力。

Method: 提出MV-ScanQA数据集（68%问题需多视角推理）和TripAlign预训练语料（1M三元组），并开发LEGO基线方法。

Result: LEGO在MV-ScanQA和现有3D密集描述与问答基准上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MV-ScanQA和TripAlign推动了多视角3D场景理解的发展，LEGO展示了预训练的有效性。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D vision-language (3D VL) learning is hindered by several
limitations in existing 3D VL datasets: they rarely necessitate reasoning
beyond a close range of objects in single viewpoint, and annotations often link
instructions to single objects, missing richer contextual alignments between
multiple objects. This significantly curtails the development of models capable
of deep, multi-view 3D scene understanding over distant objects. To address
these challenges, we introduce MV-ScanQA, a novel 3D question answering dataset
where 68% of questions explicitly require integrating information from multiple
views (compared to less than 7% in existing datasets), thereby rigorously
testing multi-view compositional reasoning. To facilitate the training of
models for such demanding scenarios, we present TripAlign dataset, a
large-scale and low-cost 2D-3D-language pre-training corpus containing 1M <2D
view, set of 3D objects, text> triplets that explicitly aligns groups of
contextually related objects with text, providing richer, view-grounded
multi-object multimodal alignment signals than previous single-object
annotations. We further develop LEGO, a baseline method for the multi-view
reasoning challenge in MV-ScanQA, transferring knowledge from pre-trained 2D
LVLMs to 3D domain with TripAlign. Empirically, LEGO pre-trained on TripAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the proposed MV-ScanQA, but
also on existing benchmarks for 3D dense captioning and question answering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BMI是2型糖尿病的已知风险因素，但瘦人和肥胖者中糖尿病的分布差异表明，详细的体成分分析可能揭示腹部表型与糖尿病的关系。

Method: 利用AI从临床CT影像中提取腹部结构特征，通过随机森林模型和SHAP分析识别糖尿病风险和保护相关的体成分特征。

Result: 随机森林模型AUC为0.72-0.74，发现脂肪肌肉、内脏脂肪和胰腺脂肪等是糖尿病风险的共同特征。

Conclusion: 腹部脂肪分布可能是跨体重类别的2型糖尿病共同驱动因素。

Abstract: Purpose: Although elevated BMI is a well-known risk factor for type 2
diabetes, the disease's presence in some lean adults and absence in others with
obesity suggests that detailed body composition may uncover abdominal
phenotypes of type 2 diabetes. With AI, we can now extract detailed
measurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D
clinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define
body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using
large-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal
patterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full
cohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese
(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms
abdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through
segmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random
forest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection
through SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns
(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences
(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.
There were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal
muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or
fat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of
14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05). Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes may be
consistent across weight classes.

Method: 提出HierOctFusion模型，结合多尺度八叉树扩散和跨注意力机制，注入部分级信息，并构建带部分标注的3D数据集。

Result: 实验表明，HierOctFusion在形状质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierOctFusion通过分层生成和语义特征传播，显著提升了3D内容生成的性能。

Abstract: 3D content generation remains a fundamental yet challenging task due to the
inherent structural complexity of 3D data. While recent octree-based diffusion
models offer a promising balance between efficiency and quality through
hierarchical generation, they often overlook two key insights: 1) existing
methods typically model 3D objects as holistic entities, ignoring their
semantic part hierarchies and limiting generalization; and 2) holistic
high-resolution modeling is computationally expensive, whereas real-world
objects are inherently sparse and hierarchical, making them well-suited for
layered generation. Motivated by these observations, we propose HierOctFusion,
a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model that enhances hierarchical
feature interaction for generating fine-grained and sparse object structures.
Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention conditioning mechanism that injects
part-level information into the generation process, enabling semantic features
to propagate effectively across hierarchical levels from parts to the whole.
Additionally, we construct a 3D dataset with part category annotations using a
pre-trained segmentation model to facilitate training and evaluation.
Experiments demonstrate that HierOctFusion achieves superior shape quality and
efficiency compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Dense visual perception tasks have been constrained by their reliance on
predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios
where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like
CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to
dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in
local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that
CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from
spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack
local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we
propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the
self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features
respectively. \revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling
semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity
cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel,
the content features are aligned with image crop representations and
constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation
for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and
segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D
object pose estimation.} Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于残差的高效双向扩散模型（RBDM），用于实现有雾和无雾图像之间的双向转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度去雾方法仅能去除雾霾，无法实现有雾和无雾图像之间的双向转换。

Method: 设计了双马尔可夫链以平滑转换残差，通过扰动图像并预测噪声学习条件分布，引入统一评分函数降低计算成本。

Result: RBDM在仅15步采样下实现双向转换，在合成和真实数据集上表现优于或媲美现有方法。

Conclusion: RBDM成功实现了高效、尺寸无关的双向雾霾转换，性能优越。

Abstract: Current deep dehazing methods only focus on removing haze from hazy images,
lacking the capability to translate between hazy and haze-free images. To
address this issue, we propose a residual-based efficient bidirectional
diffusion model (RBDM) that can model the conditional distributions for both
dehazing and haze generation. Firstly, we devise dual Markov chains that can
effectively shift the residuals and facilitate bidirectional smooth transitions
between them. Secondly, the RBDM perturbs the hazy and haze-free images at
individual timesteps and predicts the noise in the perturbed data to
simultaneously learn the conditional distributions. Finally, to enhance
performance on relatively small datasets and reduce computational costs, our
method introduces a unified score function learned on image patches instead of
entire images. Our RBDM successfully implements size-agnostic bidirectional
transitions between haze-free and hazy images with only 15 sampling steps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or
at least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic
and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLM）中性别关联的潜在偏见，通过分析面部图像与职业和活动描述的嵌入相似性，揭示了模型可能放大的社会刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示视觉语言模型在图像和文本对齐过程中可能隐含的性别偏见，这些偏见无法通过标准准确性指标直接检测。

Method: 研究构建了一个包含220张面部照片和150条描述性语句的数据集，通过计算嵌入的余弦相似性差异来量化性别关联，并使用统计方法评估结果的显著性。

Result: 研究发现视觉语言模型在多个类别（如情感劳动、认知劳动等）中存在性别关联，并提供了详细的偏见评估框架。

Conclusion: 研究为视觉语言模型中的性别偏见提供了量化工具，并强调了在模型设计中考虑社会偏见的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) align images and text in a shared representation
space that is useful for retrieval and zero-shot transfer. Yet, this alignment
can encode and amplify social stereotypes in subtle ways that are not obvious
from standard accuracy metrics. In this study, we test whether the contrastive
vision-language encoder exhibits gender-linked associations when it places
embeddings of face images near embeddings of short phrases that describe
occupations and activities. We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split
by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed
across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic
labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute
unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for
every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the
difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean
cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger
association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association
with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling
images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate
bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the
level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were
present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender
associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by
uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation
framework.

Conclusion: LEARN为生成式AI在教育中的应用提供了新方向，未来将开源代码和数据集。

Abstract: LEARN is a layout-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
pedagogically aligned illustrations for STEM education. It leverages a curated
BookCover dataset that provides narrative layouts and structured visual cues,
enabling the model to depict abstract and sequential scientific concepts with
strong semantic alignment. Through layout-conditioned generation, contrastive
visual-semantic training, and prompt modulation, LEARN produces coherent visual
sequences that support mid-to-high-level reasoning in line with Bloom's
taxonomy while reducing extraneous cognitive load as emphasized by Cognitive
Load Theory. By fostering spatially organized and story-driven narratives, the
framework counters fragmented attention often induced by short-form media and
promotes sustained conceptual focus. Beyond static diagrams, LEARN demonstrates
potential for integration with multimodal systems and curriculum-linked
knowledge graphs to create adaptive, exploratory educational content. As the
first generative approach to unify layout-based storytelling, semantic
structure learning, and cognitive scaffolding, LEARN represents a novel
direction for generative AI in education. The code and dataset will be released
to facilitate future research and practical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在组合图像检索（CIR）中需要额外训练排序模型或依赖复杂提示设计的局限性。

Method: 使用Pyramid Matching Model和Training-Free Refinement（PMTFR）框架，通过Pyramid Patcher模块提升多粒度视觉信息理解，并利用表示工程技术从CoT数据中提取表示。

Result: 在CIR基准测试中，PMTFR在监督CIR任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PMTFR框架通过简单有效的模块和训练免费的精炼方法，显著提升了CIR任务的性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it
requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual
instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to
use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this
often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language
models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual
information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing
works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve
satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work,
we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with
Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple
but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching
Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities.
Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT
data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain
refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without
relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive
experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.

<details>

Motivation: 现有去雾方法在处理真实世界厚雾场景时效果不佳，主要原因是缺乏真实配对数据和鲁棒先验。

Method: 采用两阶段学习方案：第一阶段使用EM算法解耦配对图像的联合分布，并用布朗桥扩散模型建模；第二阶段利用预训练模型和大规模非配对数据进一步提升性能。此外，引入细节增强的残差差分卷积块（RDC）捕捉梯度信息。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，EM-B3DM表现优于或至少与现有最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: EM-B3DM通过半监督学习和两阶段方案，有效解决了真实世界去雾问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Existing dehazing methods deal with real-world haze images with difficulty,
especially scenes with thick haze. One of the main reasons is the lack of
real-world paired data and robust priors. To avoid the costly collection of
paired hazy and clear images, we propose an efficient semi-supervised image
dehazing method via Expectation-Maximization and Bidirectional Brownian Bridge
Diffusion Models (EM-B3DM) with a two-stage learning scheme. In the first
stage, we employ the EM algorithm to decouple the joint distribution of paired
hazy and clear images into two conditional distributions, which are then
modeled using a unified Brownian Bridge diffusion model to directly capture the
structural and content-related correlations between hazy and clear images. In
the second stage, we leverage the pre-trained model and large-scale unpaired
hazy and clear images to further improve the performance of image dehazing.
Additionally, we introduce a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution
block (RDC) to capture gradient-level information, significantly enhancing the
model's representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
EM-B3DM achieves superior or at least comparable performance to
state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: VG-DETR是一种基于半监督框架的源自由目标检测方法，通过集成视觉基础模型（VFM）来提升伪标签质量并增强特征表示能力，解决了远程感知图像中密集物体和复杂背景带来的噪声问题。

Motivation: 在远程感知场景中，隐私和传输限制使得源域数据不可访问，而现有的源自由目标检测方法（SFOD）因伪标签噪声导致训练崩溃。本文旨在通过利用少量目标域标注和视觉基础模型（VFM）来解决这一问题。

Method: VG-DETR提出了一种VFM引导的伪标签挖掘策略和双级VFM引导对齐方法，前者利用VFM的语义先验评估伪标签可靠性，后者通过实例和图像级别的对比学习增强特征表示。

Result: 实验表明，VG-DETR在源自由远程感知检测任务中表现出色，显著提升了伪标签质量和检测性能。

Conclusion: VG-DETR通过结合VFM和半监督学习，有效解决了SFOD中的伪标签噪声问题，为源自由目标检测提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge
domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and
transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which
limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection
(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain
adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training
paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse
caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense
objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain
annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision
foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised
framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision
Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner,
leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise
while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we
introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's
semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated
pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from
low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and
quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,
which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and
image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and
similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further
enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in
source-free remote sensing detection tasks.

Motivation: 连续类别发现（CCD）面临无标签数据中新类别的自动发现与灾难性遗忘的挑战，现有方法难以平衡新类发现与分类，且易积累错误。

Method: IDOD方法包含独立多样性模块（对比损失训练）、联合发现模块（单阶段新类发现）和正交性模块（正交原型生成与低开销表示回放）。

Result: 在细粒度数据集上，IDOD优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IDOD有效解决了CCD中的矛盾与错误积累问题，同时降低了存储需求。

Abstract: Continuous category discovery (CCD) aims to automatically discover novel
categories in continuously arriving unlabeled data. This is a challenging
problem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the
newly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
Most CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery
and classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the
process of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use
knowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more
storage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based
Diversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes
independent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module,
and continuous increment by orthogonality module. In independent enrichment,
the backbone is trained separately using contrastive loss to avoid it focusing
only on features for classification. Joint discovery transforms multi-stage
novel class discovery into single-stage, reducing error accumulation impact.
Continuous increment by orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal
prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead
via representative representation replay. Experimental results show that on
challenging fine-grained datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 探索RETFound在视盘分割任务中的潜力，验证基础模型是否可替代任务特定架构。

Result: 在多个公开和私有数据集上达到约96% Dice分数，性能优于现有基线。

Conclusion: RETFound在视盘分割任务中表现卓越，支持基础模型替代任务特定架构的潜力。

Abstract: RETFound is a well-known foundation model (FM) developed for fundus camera
and optical coherence tomography images. It has shown promising performance
across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and
systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been
used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic
disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image
analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art,
segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very
modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with
four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private
dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets.
Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification,
domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the
state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of
the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code

Conclusion: LatHAdapter通过潜在语义层次结构有效解决了现有适配器方法的局限性，显著提升了少样本分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Adapter-based approaches have garnered attention for fine-tuning pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on few-shot classification tasks. These methods
strive to develop a lightweight module that better aligns visual and (category)
textual representations, thereby enhancing performance on downstream few-shot
learning tasks. However, existing adapters generally learn/align (category)
textual-visual modalities via explicit spatial proximity in the underlying
embedding space, which i) fails to capture the inherent one-to-many
associations between categories and image samples and ii) struggles to
establish accurate associations between the unknown categories and images. To
address these issues, inspired by recent works on hyperbolic learning, we
develop a novel Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning VLMs
on downstream few-shot classification tasks. The core of LatHAdapter is to
exploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it
to provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process.
Specifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts
as the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories,
attribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and
employs hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of
them, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among
categories, learnable attributes, and image samples. Extensive experiments on
four challenging few-shot tasks show that the proposed LatHAdapter consistently
outperforms many other fine-tuning approaches, particularly in adapting known
classes and generalizing to unknown classes.

Conclusion: 拓扑保持损失函数在复杂管状结构分割中存在局限性，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Image segmentation is an important and widely performed task in computer
vision. Accomplishing effective image segmentation in diverse settings often
requires custom model architectures and loss functions. A set of models that
specialize in segmenting thin tubular structures are topology
preservation-based loss functions. These models often utilize a pixel
skeletonization process claimed to generate more precise segmentation masks of
thin tubes and better capture the structures that other models often miss. One
such model, Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) proposed by Kirchhoff et al.~\cite
{kirchhoff2024srl}, was stated to produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark
tubular datasets. In this work, we performed a theoretical analysis of the
gradients for the SRL loss. Upon comparing the performance of the proposed
method on some of the tubular datasets (used in the original work, along with
some additional datasets), we found that the performance of SRL-based
segmentation models did not exceed traditional baseline models. By providing
both a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence, this work critically
evaluates the limitations of topology-based loss functions, offering valuable
insights for researchers aiming to develop more effective segmentation models
for complex tubular structures.

Result: GVT在视频重建、动作识别和压缩任务中表现优异，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GVT通过高斯生成和集划分策略，显著提升了视频标记化的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing
tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and
patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly
allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in
low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging
without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this
work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video
tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We
first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a
set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian
Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D
Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp.,
lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information
content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding
per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a
Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into
static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across
different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a
compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction,
while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression
using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality,
outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers
comparable compression performance.

Result: 在多个3D重建和多视角任务基准测试中表现显著提升，验证了其有效利用先验信息的能力。

Conclusion: G-CUT3R灵活兼容多种输入模态，能高效利用先验信息，显著改进3D重建性能。

Abstract: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene
reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information.
Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our
method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera
positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight
modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to
extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution.
This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior
information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including
3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates
significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively
utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input
modalities.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detectors, while effective on data from one ego camera
height, struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. Existing
methods often rely on Plucker embeddings, image transformations or data
augmentation. This paper takes a step towards this understudied problem by
first investigating the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art
(SoTA) Mono3D models. With a systematic analysis on the extended CARLA dataset
with multiple camera heights, we observe that depth estimation is a primary
factor influencing performance under height variations. We mathematically prove
and also empirically observe consistent negative and positive trends in mean
depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models, respectively, under
camera height changes. To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust
Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the
model. CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by more than
$45\%$, achieving SoTA performance on the CARLA dataset. Codes and Models at

Abstract: Many everyday tasks ranging from fixing appliances, cooking recipes to car
maintenance require expert knowledge, especially when tasks are complex and
multi-step. Despite growing interest in AI agents, there is a scarcity of
dialogue-video datasets grounded for real world task assistance. In this paper,
we propose a simple yet effective approach that transforms single-person

build HowToDIV, a large-scale dataset containing 507 conversations, 6636
question-answer pairs and 24 hours of videoclips across diverse tasks in
cooking, mechanics, and planting. Each session includes multi-turn conversation
where an expert teaches a novice user how to perform a task step by step, while

### [101] [UAV-VL-R1: Generalizing Vision-Language Models via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Multi-Stage GRPO for UAV Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11196)
*Jiajin Guan,Haibo Mei,Bonan Zhang,Dan Liu,Yuanshuang Fu,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级视觉语言模型UAV-VL-R1，专为无人机航拍图像设计，通过混合监督微调和多阶段强化学习训练，显著提升了零样本准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在无人机航拍图像上性能下降，因其高分辨率、复杂空间语义和实时性要求限制了通用模型的适用性。

Method: 采用混合训练方法（监督微调+多阶段强化学习），使用GRPO算法提升结构化推理能力，并构建了HRVQA-VL数据集支持训练与评估。

Result: UAV-VL-R1零样本准确率比基线模型高48.17%，甚至优于36倍大的72B模型，内存占用低至3.9GB（FP16）。

Conclusion: UAV-VL-R1在航拍任务中表现出色，GRPO强化学习弥补了监督微调在数学任务中的多样性不足，适合资源受限的无人机平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong
generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often
degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features
high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints.
These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured
aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a
lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained
using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning
through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model
training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question
answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples
covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting,
transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results
show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which
is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT
improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical
tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical
flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires
only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with
INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉输入的深度学习室内导航方法，无需特殊传感器或地图知识，通过图像预测目标方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内导航因GPS信号差而困难，现有解决方案复杂且难以部署。

Method: 采用图基路径生成方法，结合可解释数据增强和课程学习，实现高效、自动化的数据收集与训练。

Result: 创建了一个大型购物中心视频数据集，并开发了Android应用，代码和数据公开。

Conclusion: 该方法仅依赖视觉输入，简化了部署，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Indoor navigation is a difficult task, as it generally comes with poor GPS
access, forcing solutions to rely on other sources of information. While
significant progress continues to be made in this area, deployment to
production applications is still lacking, given the complexity and additional
requirements of current solutions. Here, we introduce an efficient, real-time
and easily deployable deep learning approach, based on visual input only, that
can predict the direction towards a target from images captured by a mobile
device. Our technical approach, based on a novel graph-based path generation
method, combined with explainable data augmentation and curriculum learning,
includes contributions that make the process of data collection, annotation and
training, as automatic as possible, efficient and robust. On the practical
side, we introduce a novel largescale dataset, with video footage inside a
relatively large shopping mall, in which each frame is annotated with the
correct next direction towards different specific target destinations.
Different from current methods, ours relies solely on vision, avoiding the need
of special sensors, additional markers placed along the path, knowledge of the
scene map or internet access. We also created an easy to use application for
Android, which we plan to make publicly available. We make all our data and
code available along with visual demos on our project site

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的从粗到细的两阶段知识蒸馏框架，用于轻量级人体姿态估计，通过挖掘关节结构信息和渐进式图卷积网络提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体姿态估计方法需要大量计算资源，而传统知识蒸馏未能充分利用关节间的上下文信息。

Method: 两阶段知识蒸馏框架：第一阶段通过关节结构损失挖掘语义信息；第二阶段利用渐进式图卷积网络（IGP-GCN）细化姿态。

Result: 在COCO和CrowdPose数据集上表现优异，尤其在复杂场景下性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在轻量化和准确性上优于现有技术，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric
understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose
estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate
predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose
estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful
teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation.
However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully
explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we
propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for
human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human
joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so
as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the
student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided
Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human
pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of
the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model.
The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose
datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the
existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the
more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is
more significant.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级不确定性模态建模（UMM）框架，用于解决自动驾驶中行人重识别（ReID）的多模态输入不确定性问题，具有高效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中行人重识别面临多模态输入不确定或缺失的挑战，传统方法难以应对，且大规模预训练模型计算开销大。

Method: UMM框架包含多模态令牌映射器、合成模态增强策略和跨模态线索交互学习器，结合CLIP的视觉-语言对齐能力。

Result: 实验表明，UMM在不确定模态条件下表现出强鲁棒性、泛化能力和计算效率。

Conclusion: UMM为自动驾驶场景中的行人重识别提供了一种可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception
systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must
identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe
navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or
missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual
descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches.
While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling
capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in
resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a
lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a
multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and
cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified
feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract
complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM
leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs
efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that
UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency
under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution
for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

Conclusion: 领域特定的数据增强和集成策略显著提升了历史手稿的识别性能。

Abstract: Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking the
cultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is often
hindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diverse
handwriting styles. In this study, we apply TrOCR, a state-of-the-art
transformer-based HTR model, to 16th-century Latin manuscripts authored by
Rudolf Gwalther. We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite
of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods
designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also
evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths
of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model
augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a
top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative
improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over
the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of
domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR
performance for historical manuscripts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多维度偏好（如运动自然性、唇同步准确性和视觉质量）对齐上表现不佳，且缺乏大规模高质量的多维偏好标注数据集。

Method: 引入Talking-Critic学习人类对齐的奖励函数，构建Talking-NSQ数据集（410K偏好对），并提出TLPO框架，通过专家模块分时分层融合优化多维度偏好。

Result: Talking-Critic在人类偏好评分上显著优于现有方法，TLPO在唇同步准确性、运动自然性和视觉质量上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: Talking-Critic和TLPO框架有效解决了多维度偏好对齐问题，为音频驱动肖像动画提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven portrait animation have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to align with
fine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion
naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the
difficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often
conflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
datasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we
first introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns
human-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy
multidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a
large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K
preference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert
Preference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based
portrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO
decouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused
across timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained
enhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments
demonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in
aligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial
improvements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and
visual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations. Ours project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLLMs的广泛应用，需要适应多样化的用户需求，本文旨在通过可控解码实现这一目标。

Method: 构建视觉定位的奖励模型，并通过两个独立的奖励模型控制对象精度和召回率，动态调整解码过程。

Result: 在标准对象幻觉基准测试中，该方法显著提升了MLLMs的可控性，并优于现有幻觉缓解方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了MLLMs推理过程的动态控制，为视觉任务提供了灵活性和性能提升。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it
is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In
this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To
achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs
and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method
involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide
the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to
independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's
output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference
process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of
each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off
object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving
control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to
control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of
visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination
benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM
inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation
methods.

Motivation: 探索通用大语言模型（LLMs）在乳腺X光筛查任务中的潜力，支持乳腺癌筛查。

Method: 在四个公开乳腺X光数据集（EMBED、InBreast、CMMD、CBIS-DDSM）上评估GPT-5和GPT-4o的性能，涵盖BI-RADS评估、异常检测和恶性分类任务。

Result: GPT-5在各项任务中表现最佳，但敏感性和特异性低于人类专家。例如，在EMBED数据集上，恶性分类准确率为52.8%。

Conclusion: GPT-5展示了潜力，但需进一步领域适应和优化才能用于高风险的临床影像应用。

Abstract: Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation
with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening.
We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public
mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment,
abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently
was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and
domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores
among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%),
calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it
attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0%
malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection
and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS
accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared
with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and
specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening
tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging
applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the
tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising
trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with
mammography VQA tasks.

Abstract: Domain generalization in 3D segmentation is a critical challenge in deploying
models to unseen environments. Current methods mitigate the domain shift by
augmenting the data distribution of point clouds. However, the model learns
global geometric patterns in point clouds while ignoring the category-level
distribution and alignment. In this paper, a category-level geometry learning
framework is proposed to explore the domain-invariant geometric features for
domain generalized 3D semantic segmentation. Specifically, Category-level
Geometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to perceive the fine-grained geometric
properties of point cloud features, which constructs the geometric properties
of each class and couples geometric embedding to semantic learning. Secondly,
Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is proposed to simulate the latent 3D
distribution and align the category-level geometric embeddings, allowing the
model to focus on the geometric invariant information to improve
generalization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method, which has very competitive segmentation accuracy compared with the
state-of-the-art domain generalized point cloud methods.

Result: SAEs特征具有语义意义，提升泛化能力，并支持可控生成，同时揭示跨模态共享表示。

Conclusion: SAEs在视觉模型中具有显著潜力，可提升可解释性、泛化能力和可控性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting
the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct
activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable
features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite
their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual
domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational
power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our
experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful,
improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation
across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal
LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE
features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover
the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we
demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder
manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering
human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on
multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared
representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a
foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong
potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the
visual domain.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了单目内窥镜重建的挑战，具有鲁棒性和优越性。

Abstract: Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction
significantly enhances monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by
enabling accurate navigation and improved spatial awareness. However, monocular
endoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges,
including depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent
endoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To
overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue
reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with
temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework
incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust
initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in
conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth
estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel
correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on
LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from
physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of
the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module
is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated
signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied
to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED,
with ablation and comparative analyses, demonstrate the framework's robustness
and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: With the advancement of generative models, facial image editing has made
significant progress. However, achieving fine-grained age editing while
preserving personal identity remains a challenging task.In this paper, we
propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate
age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained
age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross
attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related
features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age
attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial
aging.Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that
predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising
image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to
incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by
modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of
large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset
(High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million
high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes.
Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art
performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.

Conclusion: HSI通过优化波段选择显著提升行人分割性能，对安全关键型自动驾驶应用具有潜力。

Abstract: Pedestrian segmentation in automotive perception systems faces critical
safety challenges due to metamerism in RGB imaging, where pedestrians and
backgrounds appear visually indistinguishable.. This study investigates the
potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for enhanced pedestrian segmentation
in urban driving scenarios using the Hyperspectral City v2 (H-City) dataset. We
compared standard RGB against two dimensionality-reduction approaches by
converting 128-channel HSI data into three-channel representations: Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and optimal band selection using Contrast
Signal-to-Noise Ratio with Joint Mutual Information Maximization (CSNR-JMIM).
Three semantic segmentation models were evaluated: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and
SegFormer. CSNR-JMIM consistently outperformed RGB with an average improvements
of 1.44% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 2.18% in F1-score for pedestrian
segmentation. Rider segmentation showed similar gains with 1.43% IoU and 2.25%
F1-score improvements. These improved performance results from enhanced
spectral discrimination of optimally selected HSI bands effectively reducing
false positives. This study demonstrates robust pedestrian segmentation through
optimal HSI band selection, showing significant potential for safety-critical
automotive applications.

Result: 在Charades-STA和QVHighlights数据集上超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 去噪-检索范式可提升现有VMR模型性能。

Abstract: Current text-driven Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methods encode all video
clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and hindering
optimization. To this end, we propose a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm that
explicitly filters text-irrelevant clips from videos and then retrieves the
target moment using purified multimodal representations. Following this
paradigm, we introduce the Denoise-then-Retrieve Network (DRNet), comprising
Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF)
modules. TCD integrates cross-attention and structured state space blocks to
dynamically identify noisy clips and produce a noise mask to purify multimodal
video representations. TRF further distills a single query embedding from
purified video representations and aligns it with the text embedding, serving
as auxiliary supervision for denoising during training. Finally, we perform
conditional retrieval using text embeddings on purified video representations
for accurate VMR. Experiments on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that
our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Furthermore,
our denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and can be seamlessly
integrated into advanced VMR models to boost performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了LogicBench基准测试和LogicCLIP框架，用于提升视觉语言模型（VLMs）的逻辑理解能力，填补现有模型在逻辑推理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在逻辑理解方面存在明显缺陷，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 通过LogicBench（包含50,000多个视觉语言对的基准测试）评估现有VLMs，并提出LogicCLIP框架，结合逻辑感知数据生成和多目标对比学习策略。

Result: 实验显示LogicCLIP在所有LogicBench领域显著提升逻辑理解能力，同时保持或超越通用视觉语言任务的性能。

Conclusion: LogicBench和LogicCLIP为提升VLMs的逻辑能力提供了重要资源，且逻辑增强不影响通用对齐性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as
foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical
understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical
''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications.
To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive
benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories
and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical
diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the
state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance,
particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality,
highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical
structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training
framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in
both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes
logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines
coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel
logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate
LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all
LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP
retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general
vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical
understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe
that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM
logical capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于空间线索一致性的3D多目标跟踪方法DSC-Track，通过动态场景线索一致性解决拥挤环境和检测不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如卡尔曼滤波）在拥挤环境或检测不准确时表现不佳，忽视了物体间的几何关系，而现有几何感知方法易受无关物体干扰。

Method: 设计了基于点对特征（PPF）的时空编码器，引入线索一致性变换模块对齐历史轨迹与当前检测的特征，并采用动态更新机制保持时空信息。

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo数据集上验证了方法的有效性，nuScenes验证集和测试集的AMOTA分别达到73.2%和70.3%。

Conclusion: DSC-Track通过关注稳定的空间模式，显著提升了3D多目标跟踪的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of
autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object
motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in
simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with
inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between
objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing
geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant
objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address
this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable
spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency
Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified
spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative
trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our
cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature
representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a
dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for
stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open
Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the
nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散分类器（DC）存在噪声不稳定性问题，导致分类性能波动大，需要大量噪声采样以稳定结果，降低了分类速度。

Method: 提出NoOp方法，通过频率匹配优化数据集特定噪声，并通过空间匹配训练元网络生成图像特定噪声偏移，结合两者替换随机噪声。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了NoOp的有效性，显著提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: NoOp通过优化噪声解决了DC的噪声不稳定性问题，提高了分类速度和稳定性。

Abstract: Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g.,
CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image
classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious
bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful
generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable
image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by
randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising
effects with different category conditions to classify categories.
Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise
instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance
changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always
ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces
the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in
DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the
instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two
principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,
we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)
noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a
dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly
initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a
Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise
offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to
replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the
effectiveness of NoOp.

Motivation: 旨在通过可重复的严格方法量化并减少人脸识别系统中的偏见。

Method: 结合StyleGAN3的身份保留生成和扩散模型的属性控制，生成10,000张平衡的人脸图像，并在ArcFace、CosFace和AdaFace上进行基准测试。

Result: AdaFace将组间TPR差异减少了60%，光照占剩余偏见的42%，合成数据与现实数据相关性高（r=0.85）。

Conclusion: GANDiff FR为公平性审计提供了可重复的标准，尽管计算开销较高，但能生成更多属性条件变体。

Abstract: We introduce GANDiff FR, the first synthetic framework that precisely
controls demographic and environmental factors to measure, explain, and reduce
bias with reproducible rigor. GANDiff FR unifies StyleGAN3-based
identity-preserving generation with diffusion-based attribute control, enabling
fine-grained manipulation of pose around 30 degrees, illumination (four
directions), and expression (five levels) under ceteris paribus conditions. We
synthesize 10,000 demographically balanced faces across five cohorts validated
for realism via automated detection (98.2%) and human review (89%) to isolate
and quantify bias drivers. Benchmarking ArcFace, CosFace, and AdaFace under
matched operating points shows AdaFace reduces inter-group TPR disparity by 60%
(2.5% vs. 6.3%), with illumination accounting for 42% of residual bias.
Cross-dataset evaluation on RFW, BUPT, and CASIA WebFace confirms strong
synthetic-to-real transfer (r 0.85). Despite around 20% computational overhead
relative to pure GANs, GANDiff FR yields three times more attribute-conditioned
variants, establishing a reproducible, regulation-aligned (EU AI Act) standard
for fairness auditing. Code and data are released to support transparent,
scalable bias evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的蒸馏方法IAQD，用于解决基于transformer的增量目标检测中的知识遗忘问题，通过索引对齐的查询蒸馏，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于transformer的增量目标检测中，传统的匈牙利匹配方法会导致知识遗忘，因此需要一种更有效的方法来保持旧类别的检测性能。

Method: 提出索引对齐查询蒸馏（IAQD），通过索引对齐的方式建立查询对应关系，并仅对关键查询进行蒸馏，避免干扰新类别的学习。

Result: 在代表性基准测试中，IAQD有效缓解了知识遗忘问题，达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: IAQD是一种高效的蒸馏方法，显著提升了增量目标检测的性能，解决了知识遗忘问题。

Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to continuously expand the capability
of a model to detect novel categories while preserving its performance on
previously learned ones. When adopting a transformer-based detection model to
perform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning
the detection performance on previously learned categories may severely
degenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)
to mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based
detection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a
correspondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase
detection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched
queries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,
Hungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of
the current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at
different iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each
query may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of
previously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we
propose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation
(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD
establishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase
models that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned
distillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of
previous categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic
and spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new
categories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that
IAQD effectively mitigates knowledge forgetting, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 现有自动分类方法需要大量代表性训练数据，人工成本高昂甚至难以承担。

Result: 新算法显著提升了训练数据集的代表性，同时大幅降低了人工成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效宫颈细胞分类开辟了新途径，验证了其在成本控制方面的有效性。

Abstract: Information on the number and category of cervical cells is crucial for the
diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, existing classification methods capable
of automatically measuring this information require the training dataset to be
representative, which consumes an expensive or even unaffordable human cost. We
herein propose active labeling that enables us to construct a representative
training dataset using a much smaller human cost for data-efficient cervical
cell classification. This cost-effective method efficiently leverages the
classifier's uncertainty on the unlabeled cervical cell images to accurately
select images that are most beneficial to label. With a fast estimation of the
uncertainty, this new algorithm exhibits its validity and effectiveness in
enhancing the representative ability of the constructed training dataset. The
extensive empirical results confirm its efficacy again in navigating the usage
of human cost, opening the avenue for data-efficient cervical cell
classification.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击的目标标签选择方法依赖随机性、模型预测或静态语义资源，缺乏可解释性、可重复性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 预训练模型适合构建可解释、标准化和可扩展的对抗基准，适用于不同架构和数据集。

Abstract: In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target
label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This
target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model
to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model
predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability,
reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided
framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge
transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity
sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect
to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our
experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these
models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static
lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class
relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a
preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a
priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models
for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial
benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

Motivation: 现有开放词汇HOI检测方法过度依赖大语言模型，忽略了其3D空间理解能力，HOID-R1旨在弥补这一不足。

Result: 在HOI检测基准测试中达到最优性能，并在开放世界场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOID-R1通过多模态对齐和幻觉抑制，显著提升了HOI检测的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing human-object interaction (HOI) is a pivotal
application in AR/VR and robotics. Recent open-vocabulary HOI detection
approaches depend exclusively on large language models for richer textual
prompts, neglecting their inherent 3D spatial understanding capabilities. To
address this shortcoming, we introduce HOID-R1, the first HOI detection
framework that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) guided supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement
learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we initially apply SFT to imbue the model
with essential reasoning capabilities, forcing the model to articulate its
thought process in the output. Subsequently, we integrate GRPO to leverage
multi-reward signals for policy optimization, thereby enhancing alignment
across diverse modalities. To mitigate hallucinations in the CoT reasoning, we
introduce an "MLLM-as-a-judge" mechanism that supervises the CoT outputs,
further improving generalization. Extensive experiments show that HOID-R1
achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection benchmarks and
outperforms existing methods in open-world generalization to novel scenarios.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法在捕捉细粒度实例级细节和复杂关系结构方面表现不佳，导致性能不理想。

Method: 提出两种新损失函数：实例级嵌入蒸馏（动态硬挖掘策略）和关系成对相似性蒸馏（记忆库机制和样本挖掘策略）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有蒸馏方法，学生模型甚至能超越教师模型的准确性。

Conclusion: 统一框架实现了实例级对齐和几何关系保留，提升了蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for
deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices.
Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature
Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level
details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance.
We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions,
Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity
Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning
individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy,
thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise
Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise
similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining
strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level
alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading
to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face
recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations.
Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our
unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致视频质量下降，现有方法计算成本高，难以实时部署。

Method: 采用轻量级循环框架，仅需两帧输入，结合多尺度特征编码和解码模块。

Result: 在清晰度恢复（SSIM提升9%）和推理速度（运行时间减少四倍）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RMFAT适用于实时大气湍流抑制任务，性能高效且计算负担低。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence severely degrades video quality by introducing
distortions such as geometric warping, blur, and temporal flickering, posing
significant challenges to both visual clarity and temporal consistency. Current
state-of-the-art methods are based on transformer and 3D architectures and
require multi-frame input, but their large computational cost and memory usage
limit real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In
this work, we propose RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric
Turbulence Mitigator, designed for efficient and temporally consistent video
restoration under AT conditions. RMFAT adopts a lightweight recurrent framework
that restores each frame using only two inputs at a time, significantly
reducing temporal window size and computational burden. It further integrates
multi-scale feature encoding and decoding with temporal warping modules at both
encoder and decoder stages to enhance spatial detail and temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world atmospheric turbulence
datasets demonstrate that RMFAT not only outperforms existing methods in terms
of clarity restoration (with nearly a 9\% improvement in SSIM) but also
achieves significantly improved inference speed (more than a fourfold reduction
in runtime), making it particularly suitable for real-time atmospheric
turbulence suppression tasks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have become the go-to method for biomedical instance

fine-tuning can address this limitation, it requires annotated data that may
not be readily available. We propose SelfAdapt, a method that enables the
adaptation of pre-trained cell segmentation models without the need for labels.
Our approach builds upon student-teacher augmentation consistency training,
introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate
our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative
improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose. Additionally, we
show that our unsupervised adaptation can further improve models that were
previously fine-tuned with supervision. We release SelfAdapt as an easy-to-use

Conclusion: 多模态特征融合可显著减少模板尺寸，同时保持或提升性能，适用于加密环境。

Abstract: Biometric recognition is widely used, making the privacy and security of
extracted templates a critical concern. Biometric Template Protection schemes,
especially those utilizing Homomorphic Encryption, introduce significant
computational challenges due to increased workload. Recent advances in deep
neural networks have enabled state-of-the-art feature extraction for face,
fingerprint, and iris modalities. The ubiquity and affordability of biometric
sensors further facilitate multi-modal fusion, which can enhance security by
combining features from different modalities. This work investigates the
biometric performance of reduced multi-biometric template sizes. Experiments
are conducted on an in-house virtual multi-biometric database, derived from
DNN-extracted features for face, fingerprint, and iris, using the FRGC, MCYT,
and CASIA databases. The evaluated approaches are (i) explainable and
straightforward to implement under encryption, (ii) training-free, and (iii)
capable of generalization. Dimensionality reduction of feature vectors leads to
fewer operations in the Homomorphic Encryption (HE) domain, enabling more
efficient encrypted processing while maintaining biometric accuracy and
security at a level equivalent to or exceeding single-biometric recognition.
Our results demonstrate that, by fusing feature vectors from multiple
modalities, template size can be reduced by 67 % with no loss in Equal Error
Rate (EER) compared to the best-performing single modality.

Conclusion: ImagiDrive通过整合VLM和DWM，实现了高效的自动驾驶预测与规划，展示了显著优势。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires rich contextual comprehension and precise
predictive reasoning to navigate dynamic and complex environments safely.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have
independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this
challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through
their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating
detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive
planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet
understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate
behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this
integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting
action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a
novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based
driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified
imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving
trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to
generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are
subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning
decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in
this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory
selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over
previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.

Conclusion: 当前3D物体移除技术存在局限性，需更鲁棒的解决方案以应对现实复杂性。

Abstract: Understanding what semantic information persists after object removal is
critical for privacy-preserving 3D reconstruction and editable scene
representations. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation
framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left
behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments
across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods
can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We
also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and
object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets
have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more
complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object
removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images
of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly
eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was
removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal
techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of
handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available at
github.com/spatial-intelligence-ai/Remove360.git. Data are available at

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with unified architectures excel
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet aligning them with
personalized image generation remains a significant challenge. Existing methods
for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive
fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In
this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal
Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of
unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure
personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1)
grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided
images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned
on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further
enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate
that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to
generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a
zero-shot manner.

TL;DR: CoFi是一种用于电子显微镜图像中肾小球基底膜分割的粗到细少样本学习管道，显著减少标注需求并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法依赖大量标注，临床实用性低；少样本学习难以捕捉精细结构。

Method: CoFi先用三张标注图像训练轻量网络生成粗分割掩码，再通过形态学修剪生成高质量点提示，引导SAM细化分割。

Result: Dice系数74.54%，推理速度1.9 FPS，显著减轻标注和计算负担。

Conclusion: CoFi高效、准确，适合研究和临床肾病理应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in electron
microscopy (EM) images is fundamental for quantifying membrane thickness and
supporting the diagnosis of various kidney diseases. While supervised deep
learning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on
extensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical
workflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often
struggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In
this study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot
segmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first
trains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to
produce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically
processed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,
which are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The
proposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice
coefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that
CoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated
with conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation
results. The pipeline's speed and annotation efficiency make it well-suited for
research and hold strong potential for clinical applications in renal
pathology. The pipeline is publicly available at:

Abstract: Abnormal Human Behavior Detection (AHBD) under special scenarios is becoming
increasingly crucial. While YOLO-based detection methods excel in real-time
tasks, they remain hindered by challenges including small objects, task
conflicts, and multi-scale fusion in AHBD. To tackle them, we propose
TACR-YOLO, a new real-time framework for AHBD. We introduce a Coordinate

Module to deal with classification-regression conflicts, and a Strengthen Neck
Network for refined multi-scale fusion, respectively. In addition, we optimize
Anchor Box sizes using K-means clustering and deploy DIoU-Loss to improve
bounding box regression. The Personnel Anomalous Behavior Detection (PABD)
dataset, which includes 8,529 samples across four behavior categories, is also
presented. Extensive experimental results indicate that TACR-YOLO achieves
91.92% mAP on PABD, with competitive speed and robustness. Ablation studies
highlight the contribution of each improvement. This work provides new insights
for abnormal behavior detection under special scenarios, advancing its
progress.

Abstract: The construction industry increasingly relies on visual data to support
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications for site
monitoring. High-quality, domain-specific datasets, comprising images, videos,
and point clouds, capture site geometry and spatiotemporal dynamics, including
the location and interaction of objects, workers, and materials. However,
despite growing interest in leveraging visual datasets, existing resources vary
widely in sizes, data modalities, annotation quality, and representativeness of
real-world construction conditions. A systematic review to categorize their
data characteristics and application contexts is still lacking, limiting the
community's ability to fully understand the dataset landscape, identify
critical gaps, and guide future directions toward more effective, reliable, and
scalable AI applications in construction. To address this gap, this study
conducts an extensive search of academic databases and open-data platforms,
yielding 51 publicly available visual datasets that span the 2005-2024 period.
These datasets are categorized using a structured data schema covering (i) data
fundamentals (e.g., size and license), (ii) data modalities (e.g., RGB and
point cloud), (iii) annotation frameworks (e.g., bounding boxes), and (iv)
downstream application domains (e.g., progress tracking). This study
synthesizes these findings into an open-source catalog, OpenConstruction,
supporting data-driven method development. Furthermore, the study discusses
several critical limitations in the existing construction dataset landscape and
presents a roadmap for future data infrastructure anchored in the Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. By
reviewing the current landscape and outlining strategic priorities, this study
supports the advancement of data-centric solutions in the construction sector.

TL;DR: CineTrans是一种新颖的多镜头视频生成框架，通过电影风格的过渡生成连贯的多镜头视频，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视频合成技术取得显著进展，但多镜头视频生成的研究仍处于初级阶段，现有模型的镜头过渡能力有限且不稳定。

Method: 构建Cine250K数据集，利用扩散模型中的注意力图设计基于掩码的控制机制，实现任意位置的过渡。

Result: CineTrans生成的多镜头视频具有电影编辑风格，避免了不稳定过渡或简单拼接。

Conclusion: CineTrans在多镜头视频生成中表现出色，并通过专用评估指标验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video synthesis, research into multi-shot
video generation remains in its infancy. Even with scaled-up models and massive
datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable,
largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we
introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot
videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the
film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with
detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video
diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the
diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based
control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers
effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with
the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while
adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive
concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for
transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate
through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing
baselines across all criteria.

Novel artificial intelligence tools may improve efficiency in identifying
heritage values in buildings compared to costly and time-consuming traditional

various aspects of cultural heritage value in fa\c{c}ade images. Using this
data and building register data as features, machine learning models were
trained to classify multi-family and non-residential buildings in Stockholm,
Sweden. Validation against an expert-created inventory shows a macro F1-score
of 0.71 using a combination of register data and features retrieved from GPT,
and a score of 0.60 using only GPT-derived data. The presented methodology can
contribute to a higher-quality database and thus support careful energy
efficiency measures and integrated consideration of heritage value in
large-scale energetic refurbishment scenarios.

Conclusion: VeteranAD通过感知与规划的耦合设计，充分释放了端到端方法的潜力，为自动驾驶提供了更准确和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable advancements in recent
years. Existing methods primarily follow a perception-planning paradigm, where
perception and planning are executed sequentially within a fully differentiable
framework for planning-oriented optimization. We further advance this paradigm
through a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception into
the planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided by
evolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning
performance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled
perception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. By
incorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, the
perception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements along
these trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planning
trajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and the
planning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt an
autoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories while
focusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step. With this
simple yet effective design, VeteranAD fully unleashes the potential of
planning-oriented end-to-end methods, leading to more accurate and reliable
driving behavior. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive datasets
demonstrate that our VeteranAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN在视觉识别任务中表现优异，但其依赖规则网格结构，难以建模复杂拓扑关系和非局部语义。

Method: HGFE构建了两种互补的图结构：局部空间依赖的窗口内图卷积和全局语义关系的窗口间超节点交互，并引入自适应频率调制模块平衡信号传播。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-100、PASCAL VOC等）上的实验验证了HGFE在结构表示和识别性能上的提升。

Conclusion: HGFE是一种轻量级、端到端可训练的模块，可无缝集成到标准CNN中，有效提升性能。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
  demonstrated strong performance in visual recognition tasks,
  but their inherent reliance on regular grid structures limits
  their capacity to model complex topological relationships and
  non-local semantics within images. To address this limita tion, we propose
the hierarchical graph feature enhancement
  (HGFE), a novel framework that integrates graph-based rea soning into CNNs to
enhance both structural awareness and
  feature representation. HGFE builds two complementary levels
  of graph structures: intra-window graph convolution to cap ture local spatial
dependencies and inter-window supernode
  interactions to model global semantic relationships. Moreover,
  we introduce an adaptive frequency modulation module that
  dynamically balances low-frequency and high-frequency signal
  propagation, preserving critical edge and texture information
  while mitigating over-smoothing. The proposed HGFE module
  is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be seamlessly
  integrated into standard CNN backbone networks. Extensive
  experiments on CIFAR-100 (classification), PASCAL VOC,
  and VisDrone (detection), as well as CrackSeg and CarParts
  (segmentation), validated the effectiveness of the HGFE in
  improving structural representation and enhancing overall
  recognition performance.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了AIM的有效性，显著提升了EPG分数和准确率。

Conclusion: AIM能有效促进真实特征的使用，提升模型性能和人类对齐的可解释性。

Abstract: It has been observed that deep neural networks (DNNs) often use both genuine
as well as spurious features. In this work, we propose "Amending Inherent
Interpretability via Self-Supervised Masking" (AIM), a simple yet interestingly
effective method that promotes the network's utilization of genuine features
over spurious alternatives without requiring additional annotations. In
particular, AIM uses features at multiple encoding stages to guide a
self-supervised, sample-specific feature-masking process. As a result, AIM
enables the training of well-performing and inherently interpretable models
that faithfully summarize the decision process. We validate AIM across a
diverse range of challenging datasets that test both out-of-distribution
generalization and fine-grained visual understanding. These include
general-purpose classification benchmarks such as ImageNet100, HardImageNet,
and ImageWoof, as well as fine-grained classification datasets such as
Waterbirds, TravelingBirds, and CUB-200. AIM demonstrates significant dual
benefits: interpretability improvements, as measured by the Energy Pointing
Game (EPG) score, and accuracy gains over strong baselines. These consistent
gains across domains and architectures provide compelling evidence that AIM
promotes the use of genuine and meaningful features that directly contribute to
improved generalization and human-aligned interpretability.

Abstract: Accelerated aging of transportation infrastructure in the rapidly developing
Yangtze River Delta region necessitates efficient concrete crack detection, as
crack deterioration critically compromises structural integrity and regional
economic growth. To overcome the limitations of inefficient manual inspection
and the suboptimal performance of existing deep learning models, particularly
for small-target crack detection within complex backgrounds, this paper
proposes YOLOv11-KW-TA-FP, a multi-task concrete crack detection and
segmentation model based on the YOLOv11n architecture. The proposed model
integrates a three-stage optimization framework: (1) Embedding dynamic
KernelWarehouse convolution (KWConv) within the backbone network to enhance
feature representation through a dynamic kernel sharing mechanism; (2)
Incorporating a triple attention mechanism (TA) into the feature pyramid to
strengthen channel-spatial interaction modeling; and (3) Designing an FP-IoU
loss function to facilitate adaptive bounding box regression penalization.
Experimental validation demonstrates that the enhanced model achieves
significant performance improvements over the baseline, attaining 91.3%
precision, 76.6% recall, and 86.4% mAP@50. Ablation studies confirm the
synergistic efficacy of the proposed modules. Furthermore, robustness tests
indicate stable performance under conditions of data scarcity and noise
interference. This research delivers an efficient computer vision solution for
automated infrastructure inspection, exhibiting substantial practical
engineering value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效跟踪器通常因降低计算复杂性和模型参数而牺牲特征表示能力，限制了其在复杂环境中的准确性。

Method: MST利用多状态生成（MSG）产生多状态特征，通过SSE进行专门增强，并通过CSI模块实现状态间的交互和互补特征整合。

Result: 实验表明，MST在多个数据集上优于现有高效跟踪器，显著提升了跟踪准确性和鲁棒性，计算开销极低（0.1 GFLOPs，0.66 M参数）。

Conclusion: MST通过轻量级设计显著提升了跟踪性能，尤其在GOT-10K数据集上AO分数提高了4.5%。

Abstract: Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational
complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the
expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their
ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To
overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes
highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized
enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG)
and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state
interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while
incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking
robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple
state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE
refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates
information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of
complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a
highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD)
design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters.
Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient
trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy
and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an
AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on
the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image
classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains
challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on
an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and
loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction
capability and classification performance while reducing computational
complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global
Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the
ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features
and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module,
termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the
adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead.
Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function
to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance.
Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum
classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs,
exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image
classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible
and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging
analysis models.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最优，显著超越现有方法（如ReVOS和ReasonVOS），并减少幻觉现象。

Conclusion: Veason-R1通过结构化推理和强化学习，实现了视频推理分割任务的性能突破。

Abstract: Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects in
videos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent and
temporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models
(LVLMs) to encode object semantics into <SEG> tokens for mask prediction.
However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference
and suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawing
inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce
Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in
segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we
curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning
trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding,
yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO
fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by
optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward
mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal
consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding.
Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by
significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS),
while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and model
weights will be available at Veason-R1.

Conclusion: AAG为工业异常检测提供了一种高效、无需训练的异常生成解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (AD) plays a significant role in manufacturing
where a long-standing challenge is data scarcity. A growing body of works have
emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,
these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be
trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly
generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s
strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a
normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and
natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in
other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement
(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion
based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in
specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual
tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies
need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose
Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal
visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies
are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its
utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance
of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.

TL;DR: TrajSV是一个基于轨迹的框架，解决了体育分析中的数据不可用、缺乏有效轨迹框架和标签不足的问题，通过三个模块和对比损失优化，在体育视频检索、动作识别和视频字幕任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决体育分析中数据不可用、缺乏有效轨迹框架和标签不足的问题。

Method: 提出TrajSV框架，包含数据预处理、Clip Representation Network (CRNet)和Video Representation Network (VRNet)，使用轨迹增强的Transformer模块和对比损失优化。

Result: 在体育视频检索中提升近70%，动作识别中9/17类别达到最优，视频字幕提升近20%。

Conclusion: TrajSV在体育视频分析中表现优异，并成功部署为实际系统。

Abstract: Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and
industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this
field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)
lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for
sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a
trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.
TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation
Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data
preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports
broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to
learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet
learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual
features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive
loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an
unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video
datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,
soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,
sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results
demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video
retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in
action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action
categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.
Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications
based on TrajSV.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，视频语言模型中位置编码对时间理解影响较小，而帧顺序反转会显著降低性能。时间信息通过帧间注意力逐步合成，最终整合到查询令牌中。基于此，提出了两种效率优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视频语言模型中时间理解的机制，尤其是位置编码的作用，以改进模型性能。

Method: 通过分析实验揭示时间信息的整合路径，并提出两种效率策略：分阶段跨模态注意力和时间退出机制。

Result: 实验验证了两种策略的有效性，揭示了时间信息通过帧间注意力合成的机制。

Conclusion: 时间理解源于帧间令牌交互，位置编码作用有限，提出的策略为未来模型改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Video language models (VideoLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
understanding. However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying
event order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core
challenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism
for encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or
modifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of
temporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while
preserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this
behavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal
information is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information
pathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame
attention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the
query tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges
from inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,
which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we
propose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a
temporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal
understanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement.

<details>

Motivation: 传统遥感方法（如LiDAR）成本高且不适用于实时监测，本研究旨在提供一种快速、低成本且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 结合单目深度估计、深度误差校正和几何三角测量，从车载摄像头视频流中生成准确的空间和结构数据。

Result: 深度校正模型表现优异（R2 = 0.92），定位误差平均为2.83米，高度估计误差为2.09米（树木）和0.88米（杆状物）。

Conclusion: 该框架为城市植被和基础设施监测提供了一种实时、低成本且高效的解决方案，适用于公用事业公司和城市规划者。

Abstract: Our study introduces a novel, low-cost, and reproducible framework for
real-time, object-level structural assessment and geolocation of roadside
vegetation and infrastructure with commonly available but underutilized
dashboard camera (dashcam) video data. We developed an end-to-end pipeline that
combines monocular depth estimation, depth error correction, and geometric
triangulation to generate accurate spatial and structural data from
street-level video streams from vehicle-mounted dashcams. Depth maps were first
estimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a
gradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly
for distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive
performance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly
reducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using
GPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole
camera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of camera
placement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave the
highest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absolute
error (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to combine monocular depth
modeling, triangulated GPS-based geolocation, and real-time structural
assessment for urban vegetation and infrastructure using consumer-grade video
data. Our approach complements conventional RS methods, such as LiDAR and image
by offering a fast, real-time, and cost-effective solution for object-level
monitoring of vegetation risks and infrastructure exposure, making it
especially valuable for utility companies, and urban planners aiming for
scalable and frequent assessments in dynamic urban environments.

TL;DR: CoreEditor提出了一种基于文本驱动的3D编辑框架，通过引入对应约束注意力机制和语义相似性，解决了多视图一致性问题，并提供了选择性编辑功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本驱动的3D编辑中难以保持多视图一致性，导致编辑效果不足和细节模糊。

Method: 采用对应约束注意力机制，结合几何对齐和语义相似性，设计选择性编辑流程。

Result: 实验表明，CoreEditor能生成高质量、3D一致的编辑结果，细节更清晰，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoreEditor通过创新的注意力机制和语义建模，实现了更可靠的多视图编辑，提升了用户控制灵活性。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing seeks to modify 3D scenes according to textual
descriptions, and most existing approaches tackle this by adapting pre-trained
2D image editors to multi-view inputs. However, without explicit control over
multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view
consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce
CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key
innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces
precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout
the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment,
we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling
more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In
addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose
preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and
user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality,
3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior
methods.

TL;DR: LoRAtorio是一种无需训练的多LoRA组合框架，通过利用模型内在行为解决现有方法在多LoRA组合中的不足，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多LoRA组合中表现不佳，尤其是在开放环境中需要动态调整技能时。

Method: 利用空间感知权重矩阵和加权聚合LoRA输出，结合基础模型的无条件分数改进分类器自由引导。

Result: LoRAtorio在ClipScore上提升1.3%，GPT-4V评估中胜率达72.43%，且适用于多种潜在扩散模型。

Conclusion: LoRAtorio在多LoRA组合中表现卓越，具有广泛适用性和高效性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique in
text-to-image diffusion models, enabling the personalisation of visual concepts
such as characters, styles, and objects. However, existing approaches struggle
to effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended
settings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in
advance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for
multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is
motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains
produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when
operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base
model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two
observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,
which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method
operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing
cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base
model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight
matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain
drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that
incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We
extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling
inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio
achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in
ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises
effectively to multiple latent diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有开源模型在图像处理和逻辑推理能力上不如专有模型（O3），因此提出Thyme以填补这一空白。

Method: 引入Thyme范式，通过两阶段训练（SFT和RL）实现代码生成和决策优化，并提出GRPO-ATS算法平衡推理与代码执行。

Result: 在近20个基准测试中，Thyme在感知和复杂推理任务中表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Thyme通过代码生成和执行实现了图像处理和推理能力的提升，为多模态模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,
recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the
reasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning
tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently
offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform
diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning
capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this
direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for
enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by
autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and
computational operations via executable code. This approach not only
facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,
rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,
all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these
operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:
an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,
followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually
collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the
learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies
distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning
exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental
analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20
benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,
particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning
tasks.

Motivation: 现有条件格式规则创建复杂且依赖用户输入，TaFo旨在完全自动化这一过程。

Method: TaFo结合组件合成系统、语言模型语义知识和多样性规则排名，自动学习规则触发和视觉格式属性。

Result: 在180万公开工作簿测试中，TaFo比现有系统准确率高15.6%--26.5%，生成更多样且完整的建议。

Conclusion: TaFo通过自动化条件格式生成，显著提升了表格格式化的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Spreadsheet manipulation software are widely used for data management and
analysis of tabular data, yet the creation of conditional formatting (CF) rules
remains a complex task requiring technical knowledge and experience with
specific platforms. In this paper we present TaFo, a neuro-symbolic approach to
generating CF suggestions for tables, addressing common challenges such as user
unawareness, difficulty in rule creation, and inadequate user interfaces. TaFo
takes inspiration from component based synthesis systems and extends them with
semantic knowledge of language models and a diversity preserving rule
ranking.Unlike previous methods focused on structural formatting, TaFo uniquely
incorporates value-based formatting, automatically learning both the rule
trigger and the associated visual formatting properties for CF rules. By
removing the dependency on user specification used by existing techniques in
the form of formatted examples or natural language instruction, TaFo makes
formatting completely predictive and automated for the user. To evaluate TaFo,
we use a corpus of 1.8 Million public workbooks with CF and manual formatting.
We compare TaFo against a diverse set of symbolic and neural systems designed
for or adapted for the task of table formatting. Our results show that TaFo
generates more accurate, diverse and complete formatting suggestions than
current systems and outperforms these by 15.6\%--26.5\% on matching user added
ground truth rules in tables.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据集规模超过本地存储容量，GPU计算能力超过网络和磁盘延迟，大规模深度学习任务面临I/O瓶颈和能耗问题。

Method: EMLIO在存储节点部署轻量级数据服务守护进程，支持序列化、批处理、TCP流传输和无序预取，并与GPU加速预处理无缝集成。

Result: 在本地磁盘、LAN和WAN环境中，EMLIO比现有加载器快8.6倍，能耗降低10.9倍，且性能不受网络距离影响。

Conclusion: EMLIO为下一代AI云提供了可扩展的能源感知I/O架构。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning workloads increasingly suffer from I/O bottlenecks
as datasets grow beyond local storage capacities and GPU compute outpaces
network and disk latencies. While recent systems optimize data-loading time,
they overlook the energy cost of I/O - a critical factor at large scale. We
introduce EMLIO, an Efficient Machine Learning I/O service that jointly
minimizes end-to-end data-loading latency T and I/O energy consumption E across
variable-latency networked storage. EMLIO deploys a lightweight data-serving
daemon on storage nodes that serializes and batches raw samples, streams them
over TCP with out-of-order prefetching, and integrates seamlessly with
GPU-accelerated (NVIDIA DALI) preprocessing on the client side. In exhaustive
evaluations over local disk, LAN (0.05 ms & 10 ms RTT), and WAN (30 ms RTT)
environments, EMLIO delivers up to 8.6X faster I/O and 10.9X lower energy use
compared to state-of-the-art loaders, while maintaining constant performance
and energy profiles irrespective of network distance. EMLIO's service-based
architecture offers a scalable blueprint for energy-aware I/O in
next-generation AI clouds.

Motivation: 传统框架下，复杂资产（如矿山、发电厂）难以交易或分割，限制了其流动性和投资机会。

Method: 引入元素代币（标准化、完全抵押的资产组成部分）和整体代币（资产的固定组合），支持双向转换和套利机制。

Result: 该方法使高价值、低流动性资产能够像股票或ETF一样分割和交易，降低投资门槛并改善价格发现。

Conclusion: 双层代币化架构为投资者和资产所有者提供了灵活性，但需考虑实施和监管问题。

Abstract: Alternative assets such as mines, power plants, or infrastructure projects
are often large, heterogeneous bundles of resources, rights, and outputs whose
value is difficult to trade or fractionalize under traditional frameworks. This
paper proposes a novel two-tier tokenization architecture to enhance the
liquidity and transparency of such complex assets. We introduce the concepts of
Element Tokens and Everything Tokens: elemental tokens represent standardized,
fully collateralized components of an asset (e.g., outputs, rights, or
credits), while an everything token represents the entire asset as a fixed
combination of those elements. The architecture enables both fine-grained
partial ownership and integrated whole-asset ownership through a system of
two-way convertibility. We detail the design and mechanics of this system,
including an arbitrage mechanism that keeps the price of the composite token
aligned with the net asset value of its constituents. Through illustrative
examples in the energy and industrial sectors, we demonstrate that our approach
allows previously illiquid, high-value projects to be fractionalized and traded
akin to stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We discuss the benefits for
investors and asset owners, such as lower entry barriers, improved price
discovery, and flexible financing, as well as the considerations for
implementation and regulation.

direct memory access from the GPU, explicit inter-APU data movement, and
collective multi-APU communication. We also compare the efficiency of HIP APIs,
MPI routines, and the GPU-specialized RCCL library. Our results highlight key
design choices for optimizing inter-APU communication on multi-APU AMD MI300A

Conclusion: 改进的协议在通用图中表现优异，为精确多数共识提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We study exact majority consensus in the population protocol model. In this
model, the system is described by a graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ nodes, and in
each time step, a scheduler samples uniformly at random a pair of adjacent
nodes to interact. In the exact majority consensus task, each node is given a
binary input, and the goal is to design a protocol that almost surely reaches a
stable configuration, where all nodes output the majority input value.
  We give improved upper and lower bounds for the exact majority in general
graphs. First, we give asymptotically tight time lower bounds for general
(unbounded space) protocols. Second, we obtain new upper bounds parameterized
by the relaxation time $\tau_{\mathsf{rel}}$ of the random walk on $G$ induced
by the scheduler and the degree imbalance $\Delta/\delta$ of $G$. Specifically,
we give a protocol that stabilizes in $O\left( \tfrac{\Delta}{\delta}
\tau_{\mathsf{rel}} \log^2 n \right)$ steps in expectation and with high
probability and uses $O\left( \log n \cdot \left(
\log\left(\tfrac{\Delta}{\delta}\right) + \log
\left(\tfrac{\tau_{\mathsf{rel}}}{n}\right) \right) \right)$ states in any
graph with minimum degree at least $\delta$ and maximum degree at most
$\Delta$.
  For regular expander graphs, this matches the optimal space complexity of
$\Theta(\log n)$ for fast protocols in complete graphs [Alistarh et al., SODA
2016 and Doty et al., FOCS 2022] with a nearly optimal stabilization time of
$O(n \log^2 n)$ steps. Finally, we give a new upper bound of
$O(\tau_{\mathsf{rel}} \cdot n \log n)$ for the stabilization time of a
constant-state protocol.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TSO内存模型通过存储缓冲优化多处理器效率，但增加了正确性推理的复杂性。需要明确何时必须使用高成本的同步操作。

Method: 引入TSO特定的occurs-before关系，扩展Lamport的happens-before关系，并证明事件间时间顺序的唯一方式是通过occurs-before链。

Result: 通过研究栅栏和原子操作在创建occurs-before链中的作用，确定了这些同步操作不可避免的情况。

Conclusion: 该框架为TSO模型提供了理论基础，扩展了异步系统的通信推理，并推广了共享内存对象线性化实现的下界。

Abstract: The Total Store Order (TSO) is arguably the most widely used relaxed memory
model in multiprocessor architectures, widely implemented, for example in
Intel's x86 and x64 platforms. It allows processes to delay the visibility of
writes through store buffering. While this supports hardware-level
optimizations and makes a significant contribution to multiprocessor
efficiency, it complicates reasoning about correctness, as executions may
violate sequential consistency. Ensuring correct behavior often requires
inserting synchronization primitives such as memory fences ($F$) or atomic
read-modify-write ($RMW$) operations, but this approach can incur significant
performance costs. In this work, we develop a semantic framework that precisely
characterizes when such synchronization is necessary under TSO. We introduce a
novel TSO-specific occurs-before relation, which adapts Lamport's celebrated
happens-before relation from asynchronous message-passing systems to the TSO
setting. Our main result is a theorem that proves that the only way to ensure
that two events that take place at different sites are temporally ordered is by
having the execution create an occurs-before chain between the events. By
studying the role of fences and $RMW$s in creating occurs-before chains, we are
then able to capture cases in which these costly synchronization operations are
unavoidable. Since proper real-time ordering of events is a fundamental aspect
of consistency conditions such as Linearizability, our analysis provides a
sound theoretical understanding of essential aspects of the TSO model. In
particular, we are able to generalize prior lower bounds for linearizable
implementations of shared memory objects. Our results capture the structure of
information flow and causality in the TSO model by extending the standard
communication-based reasoning from asynchronous systems to the TSO memory
model.

bidiagonal divide-and-conquer (BDC) method. We reformulate the algorithm and
data layout of different steps for SVD computation, performing all panel-level
computations and trailing matrix updates entirely on GPU to eliminate CPU-GPU
data transfers. Furthermore, we integrate related computations to optimize BLAS
utilization, thereby increasing arithmetic intensity and fully leveraging the
computational capabilities of GPUs. Additionally, we introduce a newly
developed GPU-based BDC algorithm that restructures the workflow to eliminate
matrix-level CPU-GPU data transfers and enable asynchronous execution between
the CPU and GPU. Experimental results on AMD MI210 and NVIDIA V100 GPUs
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves speedups of up to 1293.64x/7.47x
and 14.10x/12.38x compared to rocSOLVER/cuSOLVER and MAGMA, respectively.

### [157] [CrossTrace: Efficient Cross-Thread and Cross-Service Span Correlation in Distributed Tracing for Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11342)
*Linh-An Phan,MingXue Wang,Guangyu Wu,Wang Dawei,Chen Liqun,Li Jin*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: CrossTrace是一种无需修改源代码的分布式追踪解决方案，通过贪婪算法和eBPF技术高效关联跨服务追踪数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零代码分布式追踪中跨服务关联的挑战，避免现有方案的安全性和性能问题。

Method: 使用贪婪算法推断服务内追踪关系，通过eBPF在TCP包头嵌入标识符实现跨服务关联。

Result: 在几秒内以超过90%的准确率关联数千条追踪数据，适合生产环境部署。

Conclusion: CrossTrace为微服务调试提供了一种高效、安全的分布式追踪方案。

Abstract: Distributed tracing has become an essential technique for debugging and
troubleshooting modern microservice-based applications, enabling software
engineers to detect performance bottlenecks, identify failures, and gain
insights into system behavior. However, implementing distributed tracing in
large-scale applications remains challenging due to the need for extensive
instrumentation. To reduce this burden, zero-code instrumentation solutions,
such as those based on eBPF, have emerged, allowing span data to be collected
without modifying application code. Despite this promise, span correlation, the
process of establishing causal relationships between spans, remains a critical
challenge in zero-code approaches. Existing solutions often rely on thread
affinity, compromise system security by requiring the kernel integrity mode to
be disabled, or incur significant computational overhead due to complex
inference algorithms. This paper presents CrossTrace, a practical and efficient
distributed tracing solution designed to support the debugging of microservice
applications without requiring source code modifications. CrossTrace employs a
greedy algorithm to infer intra-service span relationships from delay patterns,
eliminating reliance on thread identifiers. For inter-service correlation,
CrossTrace embeds span identifiers into TCP packet headers via eBPF, enabling
secure and efficient correlation compromising system security policies.
Evaluation results show that CrossTrace can correlate thousands of spans within
seconds with over 90% accuracy, making it suitable for production deployment
and valuable for microservice observability and diagnosis.

TL;DR: 论文分析了ROS 2中DDS通信栈在无线传输大负载时的性能问题，提出了轻量级优化框架，显著提升传输效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROS 2的DDS通信栈在无线传输大负载时性能下降，但原因未明，需深入分析并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过网络层分析发现IP分片、重传时机和缓冲区拥塞问题，提出基于XML的QoS配置优化框架。

Result: 实验表明，优化框架在无线环境下成功传输大负载，同时保持低延迟。

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级优化框架无需修改协议或额外组件，显著提升ROS 2在无线环境中的性能。

Abstract: Wireless transmission of large payloads, such as high-resolution images and
LiDAR point clouds, is a major bottleneck in ROS 2, the leading open-source
robotics middleware. The default Data Distribution Service (DDS) communication
stack in ROS 2 exhibits significant performance degradation over lossy wireless
links. Despite the widespread use of ROS 2, the underlying causes of these
wireless communication challenges remain unexplored. In this paper, we present
the first in-depth network-layer analysis of ROS 2's DDS stack under wireless
conditions with large payloads. We identify the following three key issues:
excessive IP fragmentation, inefficient retransmission timing, and congestive
buffer bursts. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight and fully
compatible DDS optimization framework that tunes communication parameters based
on link and payload characteristics. Our solution can be seamlessly applied
through the standard ROS 2 application interface via simple XML-based QoS
configuration, requiring no protocol modifications, no additional components,
and virtually no integration efforts. Extensive experiments across various
wireless scenarios demonstrate that our framework successfully delivers large
payloads in conditions where existing DDS modes fail, while maintaining low
end-to-end latency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的D2Q Synchronizer算法，用于在分布式SDN中优化网络和用户性能，显著降低网络成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式SDN同步策略未联合优化网络和用户性能，需改进。

Method: 采用强化学习算法D2Q Synchronizer，策略性地将任务卸载到边缘服务器以满足延迟需求。

Result: 相比启发式和其他学习策略，网络成本分别降低至少45%和10%，同时满足QoS需求。

Conclusion: D2Q Synchronizer在动态多域SDN网络中表现优异，显著优化性能和成本。

Abstract: In distributed Software-Defined Networking (SDN), distributed SDN controllers
require synchronization to maintain a global network state. Despite the
availability of synchronization policies for distributed SDN architectures,
most policies do not consider joint optimization of network and user
performance. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning-based algorithm
called D2Q Synchronizer, to minimize long-term network costs by strategically
offloading time-sensitive tasks to cost-effective edge servers while satisfying
the latency requirements for all tasks. Evaluation results demonstrate the
superiority of our synchronizer compared to heuristic and other learning
policies in literature, by reducing network costs by at least 45% and 10%,
respectively, while ensuring the QoS requirements for all user tasks across
dynamic and multi-domain SDN networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于归约的解释器需要大量样板代码，增加了实现复杂度。

Method: 应用泛型编程技术来减少代码重复。

Result: 通过泛型编程显著减少了解释器实现中的样板代码。

Conclusion: 泛型编程是减少基于归约解释器中样板代码的有效方法。

Abstract: Reduction-based interpreters are traditionally defined in terms of a one-step
reduction function which systematically decomposes a term into a potential
redex and context, contracts the redex, and recomposes it to construct the new
term to be further reduced. While implementing such interpreters follows a
systematic recipe, they often require interpreter engineers to write a
substantial amount of code -- much of it boilerplate. In this paper, we apply
well-known techniques from generic programming to reduce boilerplate code in
reduction-based interpreters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在功能数组语言中实现高效、灵活且抽象的哈希映射，解决动态大小键等挑战，并优化GPU执行性能。

Method: 功能化Fredman等人的哈希映射构造并扁平化，在Futhark中实现，支持多态和抽象接口，通过关联上下文处理动态大小键。

Result: GPU性能优于传统方法，但cuCollections库在构建速度上更快。性能差异部分源于Futhark编译器的代码生成限制，部分源于数据并行编程模型的表达限制。

Conclusion: 功能数组语言模型可能需要扩展以弥补当前性能差距，同时需权衡编程模型的简洁性与性能优化需求。

Abstract: We present a systematic derivation of a data-parallel implementation of
two-level, static and collision-free hash maps, by giving a functional
formulation of the Fredman et al. construction, and then flattening it. We
discuss the challenges of providing a flexible, polymorphic, and abstract
interface to hash maps in a functional array language, with particular
attention paid to the problem of dynamically sized keys, which we address by
associating each hash map with an arbitrary context. The algorithm is
implemented in Futhark, and the achieved GPU execution performance is compared
on simple benchmark problems. We find that our hash maps outperform
conventional tree/search-based approaches. Furthermore, our implementation is
compared against the state-of-the-art cuCollections library, which is
significantly faster for hash map construction, and to a lesser degree for
lookups. We explain to which extent the performance difference is due to
low-level code generation limitation in the Futhark compiler, and to which
extent it can be attributed to the data-parallel programming vocabulary not
providing the constructs necessary to express the equivalent of the algorithms
used by cuCollections. We end by reflecting to which extent the functional
array language programming model could, or should, be extended to address these
weaknesses.

Motivation: 探索GPT在代码审查流程中的阶段特异性效果，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 结合半自动化启发式方法筛选GPT辅助的PR，并采用统计建模（如多元线性回归和Mann-Whitney U检验）进行分析。

Result: GPT辅助的PR中位解析时间减少60%（9小时 vs 23小时），审查时间减少33%，等待时间减少87%。

Conclusion: GPT在代码审查流程中具有显著效率提升潜力，为软件开发团队提供了优化协作的实用建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained prominence in the field of
software development, significantly boosting productivity and simplifying
teamwork. Although prior studies have examined task-specific applications, the
phase-specific effects of LLM assistance on the efficiency of code review
processes remain underexplored. This research investigates the effect of GPT on
GitHub pull request (PR) workflows, with a focus on reducing resolution time,
optimizing phase-specific performance, and assisting developers. We curated a
dataset of 25,473 PRs from 9,254 GitHub projects and identified GPT-assisted
PRs using a semi-automated heuristic approach that combines keyword-based
detection, regular expression filtering, and manual verification until
achieving 95% labeling accuracy. We then applied statistical modeling,
including multiple linear regression and Mann-Whitney U test, to evaluate
differences between GPT-assisted and non-assisted PRs, both at the overall
resolution level and across distinct review phases. Our research has revealed
that early adoption of GPT can substantially boost the effectiveness of the PR
process, leading to considerable time savings at various stages. Our findings
suggest that GPT-assisted PRs reduced median resolution time by more than 60%
(9 hours compared to 23 hours for non-assisted PRs). We discovered that
utilizing GPT can reduce the review time by 33% and the waiting time before
acceptance by 87%. Analyzing a sample dataset of 300 GPT-assisted PRs, we
discovered that developers predominantly use GPT for code optimization (60%),
bug fixing (26%), and documentation updates (12%). This research sheds light on
the impact of the GPT model on the code review process, offering actionable
insights for software teams seeking to enhance workflows and promote seamless
collaboration.

Motivation: 探索如何利用预训练代码扩散模型解决代码最后一英里修复问题，以提高代码修复效率并生成训练数据。

Method: 1. 通过向损坏的代码片段添加噪声并恢复扩散过程进行修复；2. 利用扩散过程生成大量训练数据，用于更高效的任务训练。

Result: 在Python、Excel和PowerShell三个领域进行了实验，验证了方法的有效性并分析了其特性。

Conclusion: 代码扩散模型在最后一英里修复任务中具有潜力，能够高效生成修复数据并支持实际应用。

Abstract: Code diffusion models generate code by iteratively removing noise from the
latent representation of a code snippet. During later steps of the diffusion
process, when the code snippet has almost converged, differences between
discrete representations of these snippets look like last-mile repairs applied
to broken or incomplete code. We evaluate the extent to which this resemblance
can be exploited to leverage pre-trained code diffusion models for the problem
of last-mile repair by considering two applications with significant potential.
First, we can leverage the diffusion model for last-mile repair by adding noise
to a broken code snippet and resuming the diffusion process. Second, we can
leverage the diffusion model to generate arbitrary amount of training data for
last-mile repair tasks (that are computationally more efficient) by sampling an
intermediate program (input) and the final program (output) from the diffusion
process. We perform experiments on 3 domains (Python, Excel and PowerShell) to
evaluate applications, as well as analyze properties.

Conclusion: 本文为构建下一代智能可信AI编码代理提供了研究基础，并指出了改进可靠性、适应性和透明性的机会。

Abstract: AI agentic programming is an emerging paradigm in which large language models
(LLMs) autonomously plan, execute, and interact with external tools like
compilers, debuggers, and version control systems to iteratively perform
complex software development tasks. Unlike conventional code generation tools,
agentic systems are capable of decomposing high-level goals, coordinating
multi-step processes, and adapting their behavior based on intermediate
feedback. These capabilities are transforming the software development
practice. As this emerging field evolves rapidly, there is a need to define its
scope, consolidate its technical foundations, and identify open research
challenges. This survey provides a comprehensive and timely review of AI
agentic programming. We introduce a taxonomy of agent behaviors and system
architectures, and examine core techniques including planning, memory and
context management, tool integration, and execution monitoring. We also analyze
existing benchmarks and evaluation methodologies used to assess coding agent
performance. Our study identifies several key challenges, including limitations
in handling long context, a lack of persistent memory across tasks, and
concerns around safety, alignment with user intent, and collaboration with
human developers. We discuss emerging opportunities to improve the reliability,
adaptability, and transparency of agentic systems. By synthesizing recent
advances and outlining future directions, this survey aims to provide a
foundation for research and development in building the next generation of
intelligent and trustworthy AI coding agents.

RevPerf, an advanced performance issue reproduction tool that leverages app

relevant reviews and prompt engineering to enrich the original review with
performance issue details. An execution agent is then employed to generate and
execute commands to reproduce the issue. After executing all necessary steps,
the system incorporates multifaceted detection methods to identify performance
issues by monitoring Android logs, GUI changes, and system resource utilization
during the reproduction process. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed framework achieves a 70\% success rate in reproducing performance

TL;DR: PTMPicker是一种基于结构化模板和嵌入相似性的预训练模型选择工具，解决了关键词搜索的局限性，帮助用户更准确地找到合适的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于关键词的预训练模型搜索方法难以全面捕捉用户需求，尤其是在考虑偏差缓解、硬件要求或许可证合规性等因素时。

Method: PTMPicker通过定义结构化模板表示模型和用户需求，计算嵌入相似性评估功能属性，并使用提示评估特殊约束（如许可证合规性）。

Result: 在15,207个合成的模型搜索请求上，PTMPicker在排名前10的候选模型中成功定位了85%的合适模型。

Conclusion: PTMPicker显著提升了预训练模型选择的准确性和效率，解决了关键词搜索的不足。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of pretrained models (PTMs) has attracted significant
attention from both Deep Learning (DL) researchers and downstream application
developers. However, selecting appropriate PTMs remains challenging because
existing methods typically rely on keyword-based searches in which the keywords
are often derived directly from function descriptions. This often fails to
fully capture user intent and makes it difficult to identify suitable models
when developers also consider factors such as bias mitigation, hardware
requirements, or license compliance. To address the limitations of
keyword-based model search, we propose PTMPicker to accurately identify
suitable PTMs. We first define a structured template composed of common and
essential attributes for PTMs and then PTMPicker represents both candidate
models and user-intended features (i.e., model search requests) in this unified
format. To determine whether candidate models satisfy user requirements, it
computes embedding similarities for function-related attributes and uses
well-crafted prompts to evaluate special constraints such as license compliance
and hardware requirements. We scraped a total of 543,949 pretrained models from
Hugging Face to prepare valid candidates for selection. PTMPicker then
represented them in the predefined structured format by extracting their
associated descriptions. Guided by the extracted metadata, we synthesized a
total of 15,207 model search requests with carefully designed prompts, as no
such search requests are readily available. Experiments on the curated PTM
dataset and the synthesized model search requests show that PTMPicker can help
users effectively identify models,with 85% of the sampled requests successfully
locating appropriate PTMs within the top-10 ranked candidates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的过度拒绝行为（错误拒绝良性查询）损害了其可靠性和可用性，现有测试方法存在不足。

Method: ORFuzz整合了安全类别感知种子选择、自适应变异优化和人类对齐的评判模型OR-Judge。

Result: ORFuzz生成多样化测试案例，平均过度拒绝率6.98%，并创建了ORFuzzSet基准，平均拒绝率63.56%。

Conclusion: ORFuzz和ORFuzzSet为开发更可靠的LLM系统提供了自动化测试框架和社区资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit over-refusal - erroneously
rejecting benign queries due to overly conservative safety measures - a
critical functional flaw that undermines their reliability and usability.
Current methods for testing this behavior are demonstrably inadequate,
suffering from flawed benchmarks and limited test generation capabilities, as
highlighted by our empirical user study. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper introduces the first evolutionary testing framework, ORFuzz, for the
systematic detection and analysis of LLM over-refusals. ORFuzz uniquely
integrates three core components: (1) safety category-aware seed selection for
comprehensive test coverage, (2) adaptive mutator optimization using reasoning
LLMs to generate effective test cases, and (3) OR-Judge, a human-aligned judge
model validated to accurately reflect user perception of toxicity and refusal.
Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ORFuzz generates diverse, validated
over-refusal instances at a rate (6.98% average) more than double that of
leading baselines, effectively uncovering vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
ORFuzz's outputs form the basis of ORFuzzSet, a new benchmark of 1,855 highly
transferable test cases that achieves a superior 63.56% average over-refusal
rate across 10 diverse LLMs, significantly outperforming existing datasets.
ORFuzz and ORFuzzSet provide a robust automated testing framework and a
valuable community resource, paving the way for developing more reliable and
trustworthy LLM-based software systems.

Conclusion: 强调需要有效的缓解技术以确保LLM生成代码的安全可靠，尤其是在汽车软件等安全关键领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in automating
code generation tasks offering new opportunities across software engineering
domains. However, their practical application remains limited due to
hallucinations - outputs that appear plausible but are factually incorrect,
unverifiable or nonsensical. This paper investigates hallucination phenomena in
the context of code generation with a specific focus on the automotive domain.
A case study is presented that evaluates multiple code LLMs for three different
prompting complexities ranging from a minimal one-liner prompt to a prompt with
Covesa Vehicle Signal Specifications (VSS) as additional context and finally to
a prompt with an additional code skeleton. The evaluation reveals a high
frequency of syntax violations, invalid reference errors and API knowledge
conflicts in state-of-the-art models GPT-4.1, Codex and GPT-4o. Among the
evaluated models, only GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o were able to produce a correct
solution when given the most context-rich prompt. Simpler prompting strategies
failed to yield a working result, even after multiple refinement iterations.
These findings highlight the need for effective mitigation techniques to ensure
the safe and reliable use of LLM generated code, especially in safety-critical
domains such as automotive software systems.

Motivation: 日志代码在系统运行时行为捕获中至关重要，但缺陷可能导致日志误读。现有研究缺乏系统性和全面性，且LLMs在此领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出七种日志代码缺陷模式的分类法，构建包含164个开发者验证缺陷的数据集，并设计自动化框架评估LLMs的缺陷检测能力。

Result: LLMs仅基于源代码检测缺陷表现不佳，但结合详细缺陷模式知识后检测准确率提升10.9%。

Conclusion: 研究为开发者提供了避免常见缺陷的指导，并为改进LLM在日志代码缺陷检测中的推理能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Logging code is written by developers to capture system runtime behavior and
plays a vital role in debugging, performance analysis, and system monitoring.
However, defects in logging code can undermine the usefulness of logs and lead
to misinterpretations. Although prior work has identified several logging
defect patterns and provided valuable insights into logging practices, these
studies often focus on a narrow range of defect patterns derived from limited
sources (e.g., commit histories) and lack a systematic and comprehensive
analysis. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising
generalization and reasoning capabilities across a variety of code-related
tasks, yet their potential for detecting logging code defects remains largely
unexplored.
  In this paper, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of logging code defects,
which encompasses seven logging code defect patterns with 14 detailed
scenarios. We further construct a benchmark dataset, \dataset, consisting of
164 developer-verified real-world logging defects. Then we propose an automated
framework that leverages various prompting strategies and contextual
information to evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting and reasoning logging
code defects. Experimental results reveal that LLMs generally struggle to
accurately detect and reason logging code defects based on the source code
only. However, incorporating proper knowledge (e.g., detailed scenarios of
defect patterns) can lead to 10.9\% improvement in detection accuracy. Overall,
our findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners to avoid common
defect patterns and establish a foundation for improving LLM-based reasoning in
logging code defect detection.

execution efficiency remains overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce
TRACY, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the execution
efficiency of LLM-translated code. TRACY is constructed through an LLM-driven
two-stage pipeline: an initial stage generates a suite of stress tests to
amplify performance differences, followed by an efficiency-oriented task
pruning stage that isolates the efficiency-distinguishing tasks. The resulting
benchmark comprises 1,011 code translation tasks across C++, Java, and Python,
each accompanied by an average of 22.1 verified reference translations and 10
computationally demanding tests. Our extensive evaluation of 26 representative
LLMs reveals that even top-tier LLMs struggle to consistently produce efficient
code translations. For instance, Claude-4-think, the leading model for
correctness, ranks eighth overall when time efficiency is taken into account,
surpassed by several smaller open-source models. We further pinpoint that
algorithmic flaws and improper resource handling are the most detrimental,
causing a median time slowdown of 5.6$\times$ and memory increase of
12.0$\times$, respectively. Our work underscores the necessity of jointly
optimizing for correctness and efficiency in future LLM-based code translation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了从微服务系统中获取和分析时态网络的挑战，并指出当前数据规模限制了分析方法的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究微服务架构的时态网络特性，以更好地理解和优化其动态行为。

Method: 利用网络科学中的时态网络分析方法，对微服务系统的依赖关系图进行研究。

Result: 获取的时态网络仅包含7个时间实例和42个微服务，限制了分析的深度和广度。

Conclusion: 当前数据规模不足以支持全面的时态网络分析，需进一步扩展数据以提升研究效果。

Abstract: Microservice architecture can be modeled as a network of microservices making
calls to each other, commonly known as the service dependency graph. Network
Science can provide methods to study such networks. In particular, temporal
network analysis is a branch of Network Science that analyzes networks evolving
with time. In microservice systems, temporal networks can arise if we examine
the architecture of the system across releases or monitor a deployed system
using tracing.
  In this research summary paper, I discuss the challenges in obtaining
temporal networks from microservice systems and analyzing them with the
temporal network methods. In particular, the most complete temporal network
that we could obtain contains 7 time instances and 42 microservices, which
limits the potential analysis that could be applied.

### [173] [Factor Models of Matrix-Valued Time Series: Nonstationarity and Cointegration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11358)

Method: 基于样本行和列协方差矩阵的特征分析，适用于非平稳矩阵因子为满秩且异质性分量时间平稳的情况，并扩展到因子协整和异质性分量非平稳的灵活设置。

Result: 在温和条件下（允许弱因子存在），推导了估计因子载荷矩阵和非平稳因子矩阵的收敛理论，适用于弱因子强度异质性的普遍情况。

Conclusion: 模拟和实证研究表明，所提模型和方法在有限样本中具有良好的数值性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the nonstationary matrix-valued time series with
common stochastic trends. Unlike the traditional factor analysis which flattens
matrix observations into vectors, we adopt a matrix factor model in order to
fully explore the intrinsic matrix structure in the data, allowing interaction
between the row and column stochastic trends, and subsequently improving the
estimation convergence. It also reduces the computation complexity in
estimation. The main estimation methodology is built on the eigenanalysis of
sample row and column covariance matrices when the nonstationary matrix factors
are of full rank and the idiosyncratic components are temporally stationary,
and is further extended to tackle a more flexible setting when the matrix
factors are cointegrated and the idiosyncratic components may be nonstationary.
Under some mild conditions which allow the existence of weak factors, we derive
the convergence theory for the estimated factor loading matrices and
nonstationary factor matrices. In particular, the developed methodology and
theory are applicable to the general case of heterogeneous strengths over weak
factors. An easy-to-implement ratio criterion is adopted to consistently
estimate the size of latent factor matrix. Both simulation and empirical
studies are conducted to examine the numerical performance of the developed
model and methodology in finite samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究二元选择Logit模型在面板和网络数据中的固定效应问题，解决伴随参数问题对估计的影响。

Result: 总结了文献中的关键发现，并提供了新示例和新结果，展示了这些方法的适用性。

Conclusion: 研究为二元选择Logit模型的固定效应问题提供了系统解决方案，扩展了现有文献的应用范围。

Abstract: This paper systematically analyzes and reviews identification strategies for
binary choice logit models with fixed effects in panel and network data
settings. We examine both static and dynamic models with general fixed-effect
structures, including individual effects, time trends, and two-way or dyadic
effects. A key challenge is the incidental parameter problem, which arises from
the increasing number of fixed effects as the sample size grows. We explore two
main strategies for eliminating nuisance parameters: conditional likelihood
methods, which remove fixed effects by conditioning on sufficient statistics,
and moment-based methods, which derive fixed-effect-free moment conditions. We
demonstrate how these approaches apply to a variety of models, summarizing key
findings from the literature while also presenting new examples and new
results.

*Parker Whitfill*

TL;DR: Ho等人（2024）通过观察语言模型的损失和计算时间数据，提出算法效率随时间提升的观点，但可能存在方法学偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型算法效率随时间的变化趋势。

Method: 收集语言模型的损失和计算时间数据，分析算法效率。

Result: 发现语言模型的算法效率随时间提升。

Conclusion: 研究可能因算法质量的潜在性和计算选择的内生性导致估计偏差。

Abstract: Ho et. al (2024) is an interesting paper that attempts to estimate the degree
of algorithmic progress from language models. They collect observational data
on language models' loss and compute over time, and argue that as time has
passed, language models' algorithmic efficiency has been rising. That is, the
loss achieved for fixed compute has been dropping over time. In this note, I
want to raise one potential methodological problem with the estimation
strategy. Intuitively, if part of algorithmic quality is latent, and compute
choices are endogenous to algorithmic quality, then resulting estimates of
algorithmic quality will be biased.

*Jingsheng Yu,Jun Zhang*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文探讨了住房市场模型的广义化，其中代理人拥有部分禀赋并保持序数偏好。研究发现强核可能为空，而弱核非空，且弱核满足平等对待条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在代理人拥有部分禀赋的情况下，如何定义和解决分配问题，特别是关注个体和联盟对分配的阻碍行为。

Method: 采用个体和联盟分别基于一阶随机占优条件阻碍分配的定义，分析强核和弱核的存在性。

Result: 发现强核可能为空，而弱核非空，且弱核满足平等对待条件，但不一定满足平等禀赋无嫉妒条件。

Conclusion: 广义化模型下，弱核是更可行的解决方案，但其公平性仍需进一步探讨。

Abstract: We explore the core concept in a generalization of the housing market model
where agents own fractional endowments while maintaining ordinal preferences.
Recognizing that individuals are easier than coalitions to block an allocation,
we adopt a definition in which individuals block an allocation if their
received assignments do not first-order stochastically dominate their
endowment, while a non-singleton coalition blocks an allocation if they can
reallocate their endowments to obtain new assignments that first-order
stochastically dominate their original assignments. Our findings show that,
unlike the original model, the strong core may be empty, while the weak core is
nonempty. The weak core always contains elements that satisfy equal treatment
of equals, but it may not contain elements satisfying equal-endowment no envy.

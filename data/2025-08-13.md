### [1] [Topos Theory for Generative AI and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08293)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于拓扑理论的新型生成式AI架构（GAIAs），利用范畴论中的通用构造设计了新型LLM架构，并验证了LLM范畴的完备性和拓扑性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM研究多关注线性架构或专家混合模型，缺乏对范畴论中通用构造的利用。本文旨在通过拓扑理论探索LLM的新型组合结构。

Method: 利用范畴论中的通用构造（如拉回、推出、指数对象等）设计新型LLM架构，并通过验证LLM范畴的完备性和拓扑性质来支持理论。

Result: 证明了LLM范畴是完备的且构成一个拓扑，为新型架构设计提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 通过范畴论工具，论文为LLM架构设计提供了新的理论框架和实现可能性。

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

### [2] [Topos Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08295)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的因果模型类别——拓扑因果模型（TCMs），利用拓扑范畴的关键性质（如完备性、子对象分类器和指数对象）来解决因果推断中的复杂问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在展示拓扑范畴的性质（如完备性和子对象分类器）在因果推断中的核心作用，例如通过子对象分类器实现因果干预的范畴化表述。

Method: 通过定义局部自治的因果机制集合，构建全局函数，并证明TCMs范畴的完备性，从而为任意因果图提供（共）极限形式的解。

Result: 证明了TCMs的完备性，展示了如何通过子对象分类器建模因果干预，以及如何利用指数对象推理因果等价类。

Conclusion: TCMs作为一种拓扑范畴，不仅为复杂因果模型提供了统一的数学框架，还支持内部逻辑推理，扩展了因果推断的理论基础。

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

### [3] [An Efficient Application of Goal Programming to Tackle Multiobjective Problems with Recurring Fitness Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08297)
*Rodrigo Lankaites Pinheiro,Dario Landa-Silva,Wasakorn Laesanklang,Ademir Aparecido Constantino*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，通过多目标算法解决一个问题实例，再利用目标规划和高效单目标算法解决其他相似问题实例，以快速获得高质量解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多目标问题中高度约束的实例时，现代算法仍难以获得好的近似解集。利用问题实例间相似性提高效率。

Method: 先使用计算密集型多目标算法解决一个实例，再用目标规划和高效单目标算法解决其他相似实例。

Result: 在多目标车辆路径问题基准实例中，该方法在短时间内产生良好结果。

Conclusion: 结合多目标算法的效果和目标规划的高效性，适用于具有相似适应度景观的问题场景。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

### [4] [LLM-BI: Towards Fully Automated Bayesian Inference with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08300)
*Yongchao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）自动化贝叶斯推断中先验分布和似然函数设定的可行性，提出了LLM-BI流程，并通过实验验证了其潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯推断的广泛应用受限于先验分布和似然函数的设定需要专业知识，本文旨在探索LLM能否自动化这一过程。

Method: 提出了LLM-BI流程，并通过两个实验（贝叶斯线性回归）验证：实验I测试LLM从自然语言中提取先验分布的能力；实验II测试LLM从问题描述中设定完整模型结构的能力。

Result: 实验表明LLM能够成功提取先验分布并设定完整模型结构，验证了其自动化贝叶斯建模关键步骤的潜力。

Conclusion: LLM有望实现贝叶斯推断的自动化流程，为概率编程提供新可能。

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

### [5] [First Ask Then Answer: A Framework Design for AI Dialogue Based on Supplementary Questioning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08308)
*Chuanruo Fu,Yuncheng Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FATA的新交互范式，通过引导LLMs主动生成多维补充问题，显著提升了回答质量和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在用户提供信息不完整或模糊时回答不准确的问题。

Method: 采用FATA范式，通过提示词引导LLMs生成补充问题，整合用户反馈后生成回答。

Result: FATA在综合指标上比基线提示提升40%，且稳定性优于上下文增强提示。

Conclusion: FATA通过用户参与和单轮策略，显著提升了LLMs的回答质量和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

### [6] [What Breaks Knowledge Graph based RAG? Empirical Insights into Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08344)
*Dongzhuoran Zhou,Yuqicheng Zhu,Xiaxia Wang,Hongkuan Zhou,Yuan He,Jiaoyan Chen,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估KG-RAG方法的新方法，发现现有方法在知识缺失时推理能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KG-RAG评估方法存在不足，无法区分模型是通过推理还是直接检索回答问题。

Method: 提出了一种构建基准和评估协议的方法，系统评估KG-RAG在知识不完整时的表现。

Result: 实验表明当前KG-RAG方法在知识缺失时推理能力有限，依赖内部记忆，且泛化能力因设计而异。

Conclusion: 需要改进KG-RAG方法以增强其在知识缺失时的推理能力。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

### [7] [UrzaGPT: LoRA-Tuned Large Language Models for Card Selection in Collectible Card Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08382)
*Timo Bertram*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UrzaGPT是一个基于大型语言模型的AI，用于在《万智牌》中实时推荐选牌决策，通过低秩适应微调提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集式卡牌游戏（CCG）因其部分可观测性、长期决策和卡牌集变化，对AI构成挑战，现有模型表现远逊于人类。

Method: 从开放权重LLM出发，使用低秩适应微调标注的选牌日志数据集，快速适应游戏不同扩展。

Result: UrzaGPT微调后的小型模型准确率达66.2%，优于零样本LLM（如GPT-4o的43%），但仍未达到领域专用模型水平。

Conclusion: 研究表明，仅用LLM实现选牌AI是可行的，未来LLM可支持高性能、通用且易于更新的选牌AI。

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

### [8] [Bilevel MCTS for Amortized O(1) Node Selection in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08385)
*Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的MCTS方法，通过双层修改和树折叠技术，显著降低了节点选择的时间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS在经典规划中因搜索深度大导致节点选择时间显著，而传统方法在游戏树搜索中效率较高。

Method: 采用双层修改的MCTS，结合预算分配和树折叠技术，优化节点选择和动作选择步骤。

Result: 实现了节点选择的O(1)时间复杂度，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MCTS在经典规划中的性能瓶颈，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

### [9] [Solver-Aided Expansion of Loops to Avoid Generate-and-Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08442)
*Niklas Dewally,Özgür Akgün*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种避免完全枚举的方法，通过求解器仅计算生成最终约束所需的组合，显著提高了编译效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在编译时展开循环并生成所有组合，效率低下，尤其是当归纳变量范围大且具有选择性前提时。

Method: 使用求解器计算仅需的组合，避免完全枚举，生成与传统展开相同的模型。

Result: 编译速度显著提升，尤其适用于归纳变量范围大且选择性前提的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法高效地优化了高级用户模型到求解器就绪形式的转换过程。

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

### [10] [OverFill: Two-Stage Models for Efficient Language Model Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08446)
*Woojeong Kim,Junxiong Wang,Jing Nathan Yan,Mohamed Abdelfattah,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OverFill通过解耦预填充和解码阶段优化LLM推理效率，提升生成质量且延迟开销小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理成本高，解码阶段延迟问题突出，现有模型未区分预填充和解码的计算特性。

Method: OverFill在预填充阶段使用完整模型并行处理输入，解码阶段切换为密集剪枝模型。

Result: 3B-to-1B配置优于1B剪枝模型83.2%，8B-to-3B配置优于3B剪枝模型79.2%。

Conclusion: OverFill在相同规模下性能媲美从头训练模型，且训练数据需求显著减少。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our
code is available at https://github.com/friendshipkim/overfill.

### [11] [A Fast GRASP Metaheuristic for the Trigger Arc TSP with MIP-Based Construction and Multi-Neighborhood Local Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08477)
*Joan Salvà Soler,Grégoire de Lambertye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GRASP的元启发式算法，用于解决动态弧成本的触发弧旅行商问题（TA-TSP），在MESS 2024竞赛中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TA-TSP扩展了经典TSP，引入了动态弧成本，适用于仓库操作等场景。需要高效算法解决实时路由问题。

Method: 结合多种构造启发式和多邻域局部搜索的GRASP方法，构造阶段使用MIP技术，改进阶段应用2-Opt、Swap和Relocate算子。

Result: 在MESS 2024竞赛中平均最优性差距为0.77%和0.40%，在小数据集上比Gurobi求解器优11.3%。

Conclusion: 算法在竞赛中表现优异，适用于具有状态依赖旅行成本的实时路由应用。

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic
that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local
search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques
to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second
limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced
solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.
The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its
suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel
costs.

### [12] [Beyond Ordinal Preferences: Why Alignment Needs Cardinal Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08486)
*Parker Whitfill,Stewy Slocum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出，基于序数比较的LLM对齐方法存在根本性限制，无法系统性地恢复最优模型。通过引入基数反馈（如支付意愿数据），可以更有效地优化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法依赖序数偏好数据，无法解决模型间的权衡问题，因此需要更高质量的基数反馈数据。

Method: 提出使用基数反馈（支付意愿数据）替代传统的序数偏好数据，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，引入基数反馈的模型在Arena-Hard等下游任务中优于仅依赖序数数据的方法。

Conclusion: 基数反馈是优化LLM对齐的关键，能够更有效地指导模型改进。

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

Motivation: 尽管POMO在组合问题中表现良好，但仍有改进空间，尤其是在车辆路径问题（VRP）中。

Method: 改进POMO，提出POMO+，利用初始节点更智能地寻找解决方案。

Result: 在CVRPLIB数据集上验证，POMO+收敛更快且结果更优，适用于最多100个客户的问题实例。

Conclusion: POMO+为组合问题提供了更优解，有望推动领域进一步发展。

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to
100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further
advancements in the field.

TL;DR: 探索使用大型语言模型（LLM）替代领域专家验证本体对齐中不确定的对应关系，并在OAEI任务中评估其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本体对齐在跨领域数据集成中至关重要，但高质量对应关系仍具挑战性，人工验证成本高。

Method: 利用LLM验证对齐系统中不确定的对应关系，并通过OAEI任务评估不同LLM的性能。

Result: 分析了多种LLM在不同本体驱动提示模板下的表现，并与模拟Oracle进行对比。

Conclusion: LLM在验证不确定对应关系方面具有潜力，可作为人工验证的替代方案。

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

*Yuchen Li,Cong Lin,Muhammad Umair Nasir,Philip Bontrager,Jialin Liu,Julian Togelius*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GVGAI-LLM是一个基于视频游戏的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理和问题解决能力，揭示了其在空间推理和基础规划方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试未能充分评估模型在多样化任务中的能力，GVGAI-LLM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用游戏描述语言快速生成新游戏和关卡，避免过拟合，并通过ASCII字符表示游戏场景。

Result: 零样本评估显示LLMs在空间推理和规划方面存在持续缺陷，结构化提示和空间接地技术仅带来部分改进。

Conclusion: GVGAI-LLM为语言模型能力研究提供了可复现的测试平台，重点关注代理行为和上下文推理。

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

TL;DR: SynLLM是一个模块化框架，利用20种开源LLM生成高质量合成医疗数据，通过结构化提示和全面评估确保数据质量与隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实医疗数据因隐私法规受限，合成数据成为替代方案，但现有方法缺乏系统提示策略和多维评估框架。

Method: 提出四种提示类型（如示例驱动和规则约束），结合模式、元数据和领域知识，无需微调模型。框架包含统计保真度、临床一致性和隐私保护的评估流程。

Result: 在三个医疗数据集上测试20种LLM，规则提示在隐私与质量间表现最佳。

Conclusion: LLM在良好提示和评估下可生成临床合理且隐私安全的合成数据，推动医疗研究数据共享。

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督且通用的网格移动网络（UGM2N），通过局部几何特征学习和物理约束损失函数，实现了高效的网格自适应，具有方程无关的泛化能力和几何独立性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网格移动方法计算复杂度高且几何灵活性不足，现有监督学习方法难以实现零样本泛化。UGM2N旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入无监督网格自适应，通过局部几何特征学习消除对预适应网格的依赖；开发物理约束损失函数M-Uniform loss，强制节点级网格均匀分布。

Result: 实验表明UGM2N在高效网格自适应中表现出方程无关的泛化能力和几何独立性，优于现有方法，适用于多种PDE和网格几何。

Conclusion: UGM2N是一种高效、通用的网格移动方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

TL;DR: AgriGPT是一个专为农业设计的LLM生态系统，通过多代理数据引擎构建高质量数据集Agri-342K，并采用Tri-RAG框架提升推理可靠性。实验表明其在农业领域显著优于通用LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业领域缺乏专业LLM、数据集和评估框架的问题。

Method: 设计多代理数据引擎构建Agri-342K数据集，采用Tri-RAG（密集检索、稀疏检索和多跳知识图谱推理）框架。

Result: AgriGPT在农业领域的适应性和推理能力显著优于通用LLM。

Conclusion: AgriGPT提供了一个模块化、可扩展的农业LLM框架，为其他科学和行业专用LLM开发提供了参考。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to
promote open, impactful research.

*HuanYu Yang,Fengming Zhu,YangFan Wu,Jianmin Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为“diminution”的方法，通过选择Herbrand universe的子集来减少ASP中的基础程序规模，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP常因基础程序规模过大而遇到性能瓶颈，现有方法多依赖临时启发式策略，缺乏通用性。

Method: 引入diminution概念，定义其形式化性质，并通过特定编码利用现有ASP求解器评估候选子集。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，应用diminution平均减少70%的基础时间，基础文件大小减少85%。

Conclusion: diminution是一种通用且有效的方法，可显著缓解ASP中的基础瓶颈。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对电子健康记录（EHR）数据的个性化、在线且成本感知的特征选择框架，旨在解决传统方法在处理稀疏和异构数据时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR数据的复杂性和多模态特性使得传统特征选择方法难以有效提取有意义的信息，尤其是在考虑患者个体差异和特征成本时。

Method: 开发了一种在线获取特征的方法，结合预算约束和特征可变性成本，为个体患者量身定制特征选择。

Result: 该框架能够有效管理稀疏和多模态数据，在多样化医疗场景中表现出稳健且可扩展的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法支持医生在患者筛查中逐步获取最有信息量的特征，提高诊断信心并优化资源利用。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域的模拟培训中，准确评估程序性通信合规性至关重要，反映操作能力。

Method: 使用Prompt-and-Check方法，基于上下文丰富的提示和转录的语音交换，评估协议中每个检查项的合规性。在海上领域进行案例研究，测试了多种LLMs模型。

Result: 研究发现提示推理能有效实现上下文感知推理，无需任务特定训练，展示了LLMs在培训环境中的实际应用价值。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于增强培训环境中的汇报、性能反馈和自动化评估。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

Result: 在标准CVRP基准测试中提升了解质量，并在大规模实例（达30,000节点）中验证了可扩展性。

Conclusion: 混合机制显著提升了基线算法的性能，适用于不同规模的问题实例。

Abstract: In this research, we propose an iterative learning hybrid optimization solver
developed to strengthen the performance of metaheuristic algorithms in solving
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The iterative hybrid mechanism
integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model
that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer
nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the
metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural
properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to
guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach
reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the
optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP
and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes.
The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline
metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality
for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale
instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of
improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions
under similar settings.

Abstract: We present Aryabhata 1.0, a compact 7B parameter math reasoning model
optimized for the Indian academic exam, the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).
Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), current models often
remain unsuitable for educational use. Aryabhata 1.0 is built by merging strong
open-weight reasoning models, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
curriculum learning on verified chain-of-thought (CoT) traces curated through
best-of-$n$ rejection sampling. To further boost performance, we apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) using A2C objective with
group-relative advantage estimation along with novel exploration strategies
such as Adaptive Group Resizing and Temperature Scaling. Evaluated on both
in-distribution (JEE Main 2025) and out-of-distribution (MATH, GSM8K)
benchmarks, Aryabhata outperforms existing models in accuracy and efficiency,
while offering pedagogically useful step-by-step reasoning. We release
Aryabhata as a foundation model to advance exam-centric, open-source small

TL;DR: STELAR-Vision框架通过拓扑感知推理和Frugal Learning技术，显著提升了视觉语言模型在复杂多模态任务中的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖链式推理（CoT），难以处理复杂任务且输出冗长，需要更灵活的拓扑结构和高效输出方法。

Method: 提出STELAR-Vision框架，包括TopoAug数据增强管道、监督微调、强化学习和Frugal Learning技术。

Result: 在MATH-V和VLM-S2H上，准确率提升9.7%；在OOD基准测试中，超越Phi-4和LLaMA-3.2模型。

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision通过拓扑感知推理和高效输出方法，显著提升了模型的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社交代理多为场景定制，缺乏通用框架，限制了其在不同社交环境中的泛化能力和行为一致性。

Method: 基于社会认知理论，提出包含动机、行动规划和学习三个模块的系统设计框架。

Result: 实验表明，该框架代理在复杂条件下能再现真实人类行为模式，偏差比传统基线低75%，消融研究证实各模块的贡献。

Conclusion: 理论驱动的框架显著提升了社交代理的行为真实性和一致性，为通用社交代理设计提供了系统方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于记忆增强的AR代理框架，旨在通过学习和适应用户长期经验，解决现有AR代理在复杂多步骤场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AR代理难以处理需要利用用户长期经验和偏好的复杂多步骤任务，因其无法捕捉和推理历史交互的时空上下文。

Method: 框架包含四个模块：感知模块、记忆模块、时空推理模块和执行模块，分别处理多模态传感器数据、存储时空经验、综合上下文和执行AR通信。

Result: 提出了实现路线图、未来评估策略和潜在应用案例，展示了框架的实用性。

Conclusion: 该工作旨在推动更智能的AR系统研究，将用户交互历史与自适应、上下文感知的任务辅助相结合。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识可能过时或不准确，而重新训练成本高昂，因此需要高效的知识编辑方法。现有综述多关注编辑机制，忽略了知识功能的作用。

Method: 引入基于功能的分类法，结合知识类型（如事实、时间、概念等）和编辑机制，全面分析现有方法。

Result: 通过双轴分类法梳理了知识编辑领域现状，总结了方法的优缺点，并提出了评估任务和数据集。

Conclusion: 知识编辑需结合功能和机制，未来研究方向包括解决开放挑战和优化编辑效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱通常不完整，链接预测方法用于预测缺失事实，但现有方法缺乏可解释性。目前缺乏标准化的评估协议和基准资源。

Method: 提出GRainsaCK，一个模块化、可扩展的软件资源，支持从模型训练到解释评估的全流程标准化。

Result: GRainsaCK实现了标准化评估，并提供了详细的文档和教程。

Conclusion: GRainsaCK填补了知识图谱解释方法评估的空白，促进了方法的可复用性和扩展性。

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

Conclusion: E-Agent通过创新设计和动态规划，显著提升了mRAG系统的效率和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

Motivation: 探索AI（尤其是MLLMs）在情感识别方面的能力，并与人类表现对比，以推动情感智能AI的发展。

Method: 使用RMET和MRMET测试MLLMs和人类的情感识别能力，比较个体和集体表现，并尝试人机协作。

Result: MLLMs在个体水平上优于人类，但人类集体智慧更强。人机协作表现最佳。

Conclusion: MLLMs在情感识别方面有潜力，但人类集体智慧和人机协作是未来发展的关键方向。

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

*Dayu Wang,Jiaye Yang,Weikang Li,Jiahui Liang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双代理混合框架，通过分离推理和代码生成任务，减少认知干扰，提升数学推理系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单代理数学推理系统在同时处理推理和代码生成时存在认知负载干扰，导致性能下降。

Method: 采用双代理框架：推理代理负责问题分解，代码代理处理代码生成与执行。训练结合模仿学习和强化学习。

Result: 双代理设计显著减少了认知干扰，提升了推理与代码生成的协调稳定性。

Conclusion: 分离推理与代码生成任务的双代理框架能有效提升数学推理系统的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

Motivation: 直接在大规模模型上进行强化学习实验成本高且风险大，因此需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用开源模型，通过专门设计的强化学习流程和30k可验证数学问题数据集进行训练。

Result: Compass-Thinker-7B在数学任务上表现优异，特别是在AIME2024评估中达到40%准确率。

Conclusion: 该模型为研究更大模型的强化学习方法提供了有效参考，同时展示了低资源条件下的推理潜力。

Abstract: Recent R1-Zero-like research further demonstrates that reasoning extension
has given large language models (LLMs) unprecedented reasoning capabilities,
and Reinforcement Learning is the core technology to elicit its complex
reasoning. However, conducting RL experiments directly on hyperscale models
involves high computational costs and resource demands, posing significant
risks. We propose the Compass-Thinker-7B model, which aims to explore the
potential of Reinforcement Learning with less computational resources and
costs, and provides insights for further research into RL recipes for larger
models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a
specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with different difficulty distributions
for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually released and the
training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show that
Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL
model.Especially in the challenging AIME2024 evaluation, Compass-Thinker-7B
achieves 40% accuracy.

Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型在多模态输入中因隐式推理缺陷引发的安全问题。

Method: 提出隐式推理安全概念，构建数据集SSUI，并通过上下文学习验证缓解效果。

Result: SSUI数据集成功展示了隐式推理风险，上下文学习显著降低了威胁。

Conclusion: 需改进跨模态隐式推理能力以应对多模态输入的安全挑战。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal
inputs. This paper introduces the concept of Implicit Reasoning Safety, a
vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the
urgent need to improve cross-modal implicit reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了前景理论（PT）是否适用于大型语言模型（LLMs），以及表达不确定性的认知标记如何影响其决策行为。通过三阶段实验和新的评估框架，发现PT对LLMs的建模并不总是可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前景理论（PT）用于人类不确定性决策，但尚未明确是否适用于LLMs，且认知标记（如“可能”）对LLMs决策的影响未被充分研究。

Method: 设计基于经济问卷的三阶段实验，提出通用评估框架，引入认知标记对应的概率值以建模LLMs的决策行为。

Result: 发现PT对LLMs的决策建模并不一致可靠，尤其是当不确定性以多样化语言形式表达时。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs决策行为提供了新视角，并开源了代码（https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT）。

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多代理LLM系统在复杂协作问题解决中表现出色，但受限于上下文窗口，导致记忆一致性、角色遵循和程序完整性等问题。

Method: 采用结构化代理特定记忆模板，保持角色对齐的任务相关信息，并在PDDL数据集上进行了基准测试。

Result: 在PDDL数据集上性能提升38.6%，并在复杂数据管道设计任务中表现出更高的质量。

Conclusion: 通过结构化内在记忆方法，可显著提升多代理LLM系统在结构化规划任务中的能力。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning
tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种端到端系统，利用机制可解释性技术直接在模型内部识别并减轻偏见，通过线性探针和转向向量实现实时干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在社会系统中的广泛应用，其可能放大有害偏见的风险成为关键安全问题。传统方法（如数据过滤或后处理）将模型视为黑箱，效果有限。

Method: 1. 训练线性探针检测模型内部激活中的偏见表征；2. 计算转向向量，通过对比偏见与中性语句的激活模式，在推理时实时调整生成内容。

Result: 实验证明，探针能近乎完美地识别偏见内容，且转向向量能有效将偏见生成导向中性替代。

Conclusion: 该系统为构建更安全、可解释的LLMs提供了直接且可复现的方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于特征交互的XGBoost模型（FiXGBoost），用于预测乘客在提交乘车请求前的等待时间，填补了现有研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注乘客提交请求后的等待时间预测，而忽略了请求前的预测。请求前预测对乘客行程规划和提升用户体验至关重要。

Method: 通过数据驱动分析需求与供应的动态关系，设计FiXGBoost模型，结合特征工程和重要性分析。

Result: 在大规模真实数据集（超过3000万条记录）上，FiXGBoost表现出色，具有高解释性。

Conclusion: FiXGBoost为预请求等待时间预测提供了有效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨道电路是铁路运营的关键信号子系统，其故障可能导致连锁中断。传统方法难以早期检测细微异常，需改进维护规划以减少停机时间和收入损失。

Method: 利用深度神经网络构建预测性维护框架，结合ISO-17359标准，通过共形预测提供不确定性估计。

Result: 在10个CVCM故障案例中验证，方法准确率达99.31%，并在异常出现1%内完成检测，置信度达99%。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展适用于全球部署的CVCM及其他轨道电路系统，提升运营可靠性。

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法可靠地追踪生成内容的来源，导致隐私泄露责任不明确。

Method: SMA通过半黑盒审计和零阶优化机制，结合跨模态归因技术，实现了对生成内容的细粒度来源追踪。

Result: SMA能够准确区分生成内容的来源，包括预训练数据、外部检索和用户输入，并在多模态系统中实现图像检索痕迹的成员推断。

Conclusion: SMA为复杂生成系统中的数据来源审计提供了新视角，将成员推断的重点从‘是否记忆数据’转向‘内容来源何处’。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

Result: OpenCUA-32B在OSWorld-Verified上达到34.8%的平均成功率，超越GPT-4o，成为开源模型的新SOTA。

Conclusion: OpenCUA为CUA研究提供了开放基础，其方法在跨领域泛化和计算扩展方面表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open
foundations for further CUA research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代理在信息搜索中难以平衡搜索广度和推理深度，导致覆盖范围受限和多步推理中断。

Method: BrowseMaster采用规划-执行代理对，规划器根据任务约束制定搜索策略，执行器进行高效检索并提供相关证据。

Result: 在英语和中文基准测试中，BrowseMaster表现优异，得分分别为30.0和46.5，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: BrowseMaster通过分离规划和执行任务，有效解决了信息搜索中的广度和深度问题，适用于复杂推理任务。

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

Conclusion: EndoAgent展示了强大的灵活性和推理能力，为内窥镜诊断AI系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general
and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: 金融论据质量评估在文献中研究不足，但对投资决策和公众信任至关重要。

Method: 使用FinArgQuality数据集，评估LLM标注的多次运行一致性及对抗性别偏见的攻击实验。

Result: LLM标注比人类标注一致性更高，但仍存在不同程度的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 研究为未来更可靠、经济高效且无偏见的标注方法提供了建议。

Abstract: Financial arguments play a critical role in shaping investment decisions and
public trust in financial institutions. Nevertheless, assessing their quality
remains poorly studied in the literature. In this paper, we examine the
capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in
annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the
FinArgQuality dataset. Our contributions are twofold. First, we evaluate the
consistency of LLM-generated annotations across multiple runs and benchmark
them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack
designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's
fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three
temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and
alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations
achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the
models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted
analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future
research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation
methodologies.

Motivation: 科学网络话语检测任务（CheckThat! 2025 Task 4a）需要高效识别推文中的科学相关内容，现有方法效果有限，因此提出基于LLM的辩论方法。

Method: 探索了三种辩论方法：单次辩论、团队辩论和议会辩论。议会辩论由多个专家模型共同讨论，并由主席模型协调，最终达成共识。

Result: 议会辩论在检测科学研究的引用方面排名第一，但在识别科学主张和科学实体提及方面表现较差（分别为第8和第9名）。

Conclusion: 议会辩论方法在特定任务（如检测科学研究的引用）中表现优异，但在其他任务中仍需改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

Result: LLMs在认知共情上优于人类，但在情感共情上表现较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在提供客观情感支持方面潜力巨大，但情感共情能力仍需提升。

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of
people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models
continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and
companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves
two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and
emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this
study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several
small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological
tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans -
including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite
their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed
significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These
findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate
cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual
companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high
cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional

*Tadej Škvorc,Nikola Ivačič,Sebastjan Hribar,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时新闻故事识别方法，结合文本表示、聚类和在线主题建模技术，用于将新闻文章动态分配到特定故事中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升新闻阅读体验，通过自动化系统实时组织新闻文章到相关故事中，区别于传统的文本聚类或主题建模。

Method: 结合文本表示技术、聚类算法和在线主题建模方法（如BERTopic、DBStream、TextClust），提取特定事件和命名实体以实现故事识别。

Result: 在斯洛文尼亚媒体一个月的新闻数据集上验证，人工评估表明该方法能产生合理的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的实时故事识别方法有效，适用于新闻监控系统，能动态分配新闻文章到相关故事。

Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical
collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for
implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that
automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them
in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a
specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text
clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on
particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as
in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We
present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in
real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the
proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering
algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text
representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary
for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling
approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story
discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media
covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces
sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

TL;DR: TT-XAI框架通过关键词蒸馏和LLM推理提升临床语言模型的分类性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床语言模型在处理长文本电子健康记录时预测和解释不可靠的问题。

Method: 1. 通过关键词蒸馏简化文本；2. 使用关键词引导的LLM生成临床解释。

Result: 关键词蒸馏显著提升分类性能和解释质量，并通过多种评估验证其优越性。

Conclusion: TT-XAI为临床决策支持提供了可扩展且可信赖的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward
trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型的自回归生成方式速度受限，研究者开始探索并行文本生成以提升推理效率，但缺乏全面分析。

Method: 将并行文本生成方法分为基于自回归和非自回归两类，详细分析其核心技术，评估速度、质量和效率的权衡。

Result: 总结了现有方法的特点和潜力，并探讨了与其他加速策略的结合可能性。

Conclusion: 提出了并行文本生成的最新进展、开放挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for
future research in parallel text generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种透明的方法（SCBM）用于自动识别仇恨和反仇恨言论，利用形容词作为可解释的瓶颈概念，结合大语言模型和轻量级分类器，在多个数据集上表现优异且具有高解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上仇恨言论的快速增长对社会产生了前所未有的影响，需要自动化的检测方法。现有黑盒模型缺乏透明度，因此提出了SCBM以提高解释性。

Method: 使用形容词作为瓶颈概念，结合大语言模型将文本映射到抽象表示，再通过轻量级分类器进行下游任务。

Result: 在五个多语言和平台的数据集上，SCBM平均宏F1得分为0.69，优于现有方法，且融合形容词表示后性能提升1.8%。

Conclusion: 形容词概念表示是紧凑、可解释且有效的编码方法，适用于仇恨和反仇恨言论识别，并可推广到其他NLP任务。

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统性的基准测试阻碍了多模态大语言模型在持续指令调优方面的进展，因此需要建立一个严谨的评估标准。

Method: 提出MLLM-CTBench，结合最终答案准确性和细粒度推理链质量评估，比较八种持续学习算法和两种训练范式，并组织16个数据集覆盖六个领域。

Result: 研究发现：1）通用能力强的模型在持续学习中更抗遗忘；2）推理链比最终答案退化更慢；3）算法效果依赖模型能力和任务顺序；4）KL散度约束在强化学习中能缓解遗忘。

Conclusion: MLLM-CTBench为持续指令调优提供了严谨的评估标准和实用指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.
MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning
of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

TL;DR: 研究通过神经科学对比定位器，在大语言模型（LLMs）和视觉语言模型（VLMs）中定位因果相关单元，用于心理理论（ToM）和数学推理任务。结果发现，低激活单元有时比高激活单元对性能影响更大，且数学定位器单元对ToM任务的损害更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索对比定位器在LLMs和VLMs中定位因果相关单元的有效性，并验证其对任务性能的实际影响。

Method: 使用对比刺激集定位高激活单元，并通过针对性消融评估其因果作用。比较功能选择单元、低激活单元和随机选择单元对ToM和数学任务性能的影响。

Result: 低激活单元有时比高激活单元对性能影响更大，数学定位器单元对ToM任务的损害更显著。

Conclusion: 对比定位器的因果相关性受到质疑，需更广泛的刺激集和更精确的任务相关单元定位方法。

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试依赖人工标注且多集中于Python，难以扩展和覆盖多语言高难度任务。

Method: AutoCodeGen通过LLMs生成测试输入，利用多语言沙箱获取输出，结合反向问题生成和多步过滤确保数据质量。

Result: AutoCodeBench包含3,920个问题，覆盖20种语言，测试显示先进LLMs仍难以应对其复杂性和多样性。

Conclusion: AutoCodeBench系列为多语言代码生成任务提供了有价值的基准，推动社区关注更具挑战性的实际场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While
numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation
abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they
often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to
scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,
most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual
benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To
address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for
generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual
annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases
by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a
multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order
problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we
introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising
3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is
specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical
multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary
LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The
results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,
diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce
AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their
few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will
serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more
challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

interpretation while ensuring alignment with real-world applications. This
method addresses the limitations of subjective evaluation methods, providing a
scalable solution for performance assessment in educational, scientific, and
other high-stakes domains.

Motivation: 旨在通过自然语言控制多智能体系统，提升LLMs在复杂环境中的任务执行能力和语法有效性。

Method: 结合行为树和形式语法，提供标准化接口，并采用两种数据集生成方法（A和B）优化LLMs。

Result: Method B将语法有效性提升至92.6%，任务性能平均提高33%，小模型受益最大。

Conclusion: MinionsLLM为资源受限场景提供了高效解决方案，框架开源以支持未来研究。

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility
and future research.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的幻觉问题影响可靠性，现有评估方法（如ROUGE）与人类判断不一致。

Method: 通过人类研究和LLM-as-Judge等对齐指标，分析现有检测方法的性能。

Result: ROUGE召回率高但精度极低，导致性能估计误导；简单启发式方法可与复杂技术媲美。

Conclusion: 需采用语义感知的评估框架，以准确衡量幻觉检测性能，确保LLM输出的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在多个领域中被广泛用于回答问题，但其在宗教领域（尤其是伊斯兰教法）的可靠性和准确性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 研究通过零样本和避免回答实验，评估LLM在不同语言（阿拉伯语和英语）和法学学派中的表现，并首次引入FiqhQA基准。

Result: GPT-4o在准确性上表现最佳，但所有模型在阿拉伯语中的表现均下降。Gemini和Fanar在避免错误回答方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在宗教应用中任务特定评估和谨慎部署LLM的必要性，并首次为伊斯兰法学细粒度裁决生成提供了基准。

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

Motivation: 现有数学推理基准因训练数据污染和模型记忆问题而接近饱和，需要动态、抗污染的评估方法。

Method: 从Putnam数学竞赛中选取题目，并通过程序化扰动生成变体，提出Teacher-Forced Accuracy（TFA）指标直接评分推理过程。

Result: 最强模型在原始题目上准确率为41.9%，但在变体上下降19.6%，其他模型也表现类似趋势。

Conclusion: Putnam-AXIOM提供了一个抗污染、动态的评估框架，强调模型推理能力而非记忆。

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在教育场景中表现不佳，如过早揭示答案、缺乏适应性响应和易受情绪操控。

Method: 收集真实学生与ChatGPT的对话，通过CoT提示增强数据，并设计针对性案例优化模型。

Result: 经CoDAE优化的LLMs在教学指导、推理支持和抗干扰方面表现更优。

Conclusion: CoDAE显著提升了LLMs在教育场景中的适用性和效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to
their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However,
off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently
reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student
uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for
educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect
real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them
using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned
guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate
three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat
vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the
augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using
both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that
models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance,
better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer
disclosure.

Result: Mol-R1在文本分子生成任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Mol-R1通过新颖的数据集和训练策略，显著提升了长链思维推理模型在分子发现领域的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning
capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and
mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models
are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in
knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field
requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular
structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent
complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert
annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework
designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like
Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our
approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior
Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation
strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior
regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative
Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with Reinforced Policy Optimization (RPO),
tailored to boost the reasoning performance of R1-like reasoning models for
molecule discovery. Finally, we examine the performance of Mol-R1 in the
text-based molecule reasoning generation task, showing superior performance
against existing baselines.

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,

select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种轻量级DPO变体（Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero），通过引入基于边界的优化目标和选择性更新机制，解决了小型LLM在性能差距大时难以对齐人类偏好的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型LLM在性能差距大的情况下难以对齐人类偏好，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 提出了Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero两种方法，结合边界目标和选择性更新机制。

Result: APO-hinge-zero在AlpacaEval中提升了2.0%的胜率和1.4%的长度控制胜率，在MT-Bench中表现优异，尤其在STEM和人文任务中。

Conclusion: 简单的偏好目标修改能显著提升小型LLM的对齐效果，为资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output
to human preferences, particularly when operating under severe performance
gaps. In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive
Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance
scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update
mechanisms.
  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining
with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In
AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the
length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In
MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,
particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based
objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource
constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

*Lorenzo Tomaz,Judd Rosenblatt,Thomas Berry Jones,Diogo Schwerz de Lucena*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过物理学方法研究大语言模型在推理过程中隐藏状态的变化，发现一种类似能量的量在模型间几乎恒定，并提出了一种控制方法（Jacobian steering）以优化输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型隐藏状态的变化规律，为模型的解释性、异常检测和低风险控制提供理论基础。

Method: 分析了20个开源Transformer模型，提出了一种结合隐藏状态变化率和模型确定性的“能量”概念，并基于此开发了Jacobian steering控制方法。

Result: 随机权重模型比预训练模型更严格地保持“能量”恒定，训练使模型进入更快、更果断的状态。Jacobian steering在测试模型中保持了能量恒定，并生成了语义质量更高的输出。

Conclusion: 通过物理学视角分析Transformer模型，为模型的可解释性、异常检测和控制提供了新方法，有助于提升模型的预测性和与人类意图的一致性。

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于少样本比较回归的可引导多元化模型，旨在捕捉多样化的用户偏好，超越传统的标量奖励方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大语言模型（LLMs）对齐方法（如RLHF）仅能反映平均用户偏好，无法捕捉多样化的用户需求。

Method: 采用少样本比较回归方法，结合上下文学习和细粒度属性，比较响应选项并做出对齐选择。

Result: 提出的方法在可引导多元化基准测试中表现优于基线方法和现有技术，适用于价值对齐决策和奖励建模。

Conclusion: 该研究为多元化对齐提供了新见解，推动了伦理AI的发展，使LLMs的使用更公平和具代表性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

TL;DR: DeCAL是一种新的基于编码器-解码器语言模型的令牌压缩方法，通过去噪预训练学习高质量压缩表示，在多种任务中表现接近未压缩模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种高效的令牌压缩方法，以减少计算和存储需求，同时保持下游任务性能。

Method: 使用预训练的编码器-解码器语言模型，通过去噪训练学习压缩表示，并对编码器进行小规模修改以优化压缩质量。

Result: 在2倍压缩下，DeCAL性能接近未压缩模型，8倍压缩时性能下降较小，适用于问答、摘要和多向量检索任务。

Conclusion: DeCAL在预计算密集表示场景中节省显著，未来可进一步扩展其适用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to
produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the
encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on
maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that
DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with
usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among
question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL
offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症预测缺乏高质量数据集，阻碍了LLM的应用。

Method: 使用3,699篇自传体叙事训练DepressLLM，引入SToPS模块提高分类性能。

Result: AUC达0.789，高置信度样本AUC升至0.904，验证了在异构数据中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 可解释AI有望实现抑郁症早期诊断，但需进一步优化模型和数据。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统在低资源语言（如粤语）中生成地道表达的挑战，包括数据稀缺和语言变异性问题。

Method: 评估LoRA在RAG框架中的集成，对比PEFT方法，分析合成数据生成、用户反馈和自适应参数分配等技术。

Result: 动态和集成LoRA方法显著减少可训练参数且不损失性能，但在保留语言细节和实时反馈整合上仍有不足。

Conclusion: PEFT增强的RAG系统在领域语言任务中具有潜力，未来需关注方言真实性、动态适应和可扩展性。

Abstract: This review examines recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT), with a focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi.
These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic
Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic
variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG
frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy,
identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares
fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce
conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA
variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive
parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational
efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.
Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce
trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation
quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving
fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like
Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data
remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While
selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better
trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains
an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG
systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting
dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

Motivation: 现有强化学习研究多集中于特定领域推理任务，而现实场景需要处理多样化复杂环境。为此，论文提出构建一个广泛覆盖的任务框架，以弥补这一差距。

Method: 开发InternBootcamp框架，包含1000+多样化任务环境，支持自动化生成训练/测试案例和集成验证模块。通过自动化代理工作流加速开发。

Result: 前沿模型在多项推理任务中表现不佳，但通过InternBootcamp训练可显著提升性能。32B模型在Bootcamp-EVAL和其他基准测试中达到最优。

Conclusion: 任务扩展（task scaling）是提升推理能力的关键，InternBootcamp为开发通用推理模型提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by
enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning
tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios
often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that
narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present
InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task
environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase
offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited
training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated
verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make
InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,
synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing
such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we
accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow
supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to
expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an
automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.
Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning
tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to
significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves
state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established
benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come
from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two
orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning
generalist.

Motivation: 现有移动代理方法仅关注显式意图流（如步骤序列），忽视隐式意图流（如个人偏好），难以构建个性化代理。

Method: 提出IFRAgent框架，结合显式意图流构建标准操作程序库，分析隐式意图流构建用户习惯库，并通过检索增强生成和查询重写生成个性化查询。

Conclusion: IFRAgent有效提升移动代理与人类意图的对齐能力，为个性化代理提供了新思路。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile
tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents
that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance
mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve
mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus
solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while
neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes
it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to
evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between
mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset
containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables
a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then
we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention
\textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes
explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level
vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit
intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages
a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query
rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,
enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.
Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an
average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment
rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\%
relative improvement). The codes are available at

However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to

enhance performance through machine translation for both subtasks and trigger
word switching for the second subtask. The system achieves excellent

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task,
requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with
handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure,
managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes
an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages
novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key
strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided
sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We
show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the
problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table.
Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with
iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the
trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods
achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table
generation datasets available in the public domain.

Result: TopXGen显著提升了LLMs在微调和上下文学习中的翻译性能。

Conclusion: TopXGen为低资源语言翻译提供了一种有效的数据生成方法，显著提升了LLMs的性能。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use
of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into
high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into
low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and
supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by
the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common
technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most
frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are
automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the
existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily
available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an
LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in
multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse
parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs
struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and
their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding
target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source
language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance
during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts,
with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates
state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who
interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We
benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch
spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results
show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which
suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic
datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing
architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we
also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Magical的非对称LoRA架构，用于解决多源异构医学通俗语言生成（MLLG）任务中语义保真和多样化生成的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA方法在多源异构MLLG数据集中表现不佳，无法满足语义保真和多样化生成的需求。

Method: Magical采用共享矩阵$A$进行抽象摘要，多个独立矩阵$B$用于多样化生成，并引入语义不变约束和推荐引导切换机制。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，Magical优于基于提示的方法、标准LoRA及其变体，同时减少了31.66%的可训练参数。

Conclusion: Magical为异构数据场景下的MLLG任务提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the
accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent
literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such
as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using
paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the
challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically,
through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail
to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation
in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric
LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical
employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple
isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic
fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a
Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix
$A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical
incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to
prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results
on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical
consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent
variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

Motivation: 科学文献问答对科学发现至关重要，但现有两阶段RAG-LLM模型的重排器潜力与局限性尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发了三种问题-上下文-答案（Q-C-A）对（噪声上下文、语义相似但逻辑无关上下文、反事实上下文），并在五个科学领域评估了13种重排器。

Result: 系统评估揭示了不同重排器在噪声鲁棒性、相关性区分和事实一致性方面的表现差异。

Conclusion: SciRerankBench是首个专门评估RAG-LLM重排器的基准，为未来研究提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured
artifacts required for Information Technology (IT) project governance is a
critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core
administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary
synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark
of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually
annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this
challenging problem domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在幻觉和知识不完整问题，RAG通过整合外部知识（如KGs）来解决，但私有KGs的使用带来隐私风险。本文首次研究隐私保护的RAG场景。

Method: 提出ARoG框架，包含关系中心抽象和结构导向抽象策略，将匿名实体转换为可检索信息，并将问题转化为结构化路径。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，ARoG在性能和隐私鲁棒性上表现优异。

Conclusion: ARoG有效解决了隐私保护下的RAG问题，同时提升了检索性能。

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.
RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like
that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses
significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential
insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking
transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected
RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,
thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of
semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant
knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of
anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two
key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted
into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous
entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric
abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),
the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically
capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful
semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),
the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into
structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned
with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.
To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies
strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and
privacy-robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏专门为工具使用设计的高效强化学习框架，限制了大型语言模型在工具使用方面的进展。

Method: 设计了自动化环境构建管道（包括场景分解、文档生成、功能集成、复杂度调整和本地化部署）和可验证奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型的工具使用性能，且不影响其通用能力。

Conclusion: 通过改进上下文理解和推理能力，模型在工具使用方面取得了显著进步。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种时间感知的混合语言专家模型（TiMoE），通过分时段预训练和因果路由解决大语言模型（LLM）知识过时和时间泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM因训练数据固定导致的知识过时和时间泄漏问题，确保模型预测的严格因果有效性。

Method: 预训练一组GPT风格的专家模型，每个模型基于2013-2024年数据的不同两年片段，并通过TiMoE结合这些专家，推理时屏蔽与查询时间不符的专家。

Result: TiMoE在八个标准NLP任务和TSQA基准测试中表现优异，减少未来知识错误达15%，同时保持或超越单时段专家性能。

Conclusion: 分时段预训练与因果路由结合是保持LLM时间有效性且不牺牲性能的简单有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the
web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk
temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a
query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style
experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them
through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,
TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp
and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing
strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.
We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are
explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained
measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks
plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best
single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results
demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal
routing is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically
grounded without sacrificing general performance much. We open source our code
at TiMoE (Github): https://github.com/epfml/TiMoE

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法全面评估LLMs的数学推理能力，需通过非数学扰动测试其鲁棒性。

Method: 使用数学等价但语言和参数变化的题目构建PutnamGAP数据集，评估多种LLMs的鲁棒性。

Result: 18个商业和开源模型在变体题目上表现显著下降，如OpenAI的O3模型在核心变体上下降10.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 新评估方法有效揭示了LLMs的鲁棒性问题，为提升其数学推理能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型应用广泛，但其编码和复制意识形态偏见的倾向引发担忧，尤其是在政治和经济维度。

Method: 基于政治罗盘测试（PCT），使用对比对提取和比较模型（如Mistral和DeepSeek）的隐藏层激活，并引入分层分析管道。

Result: 研究发现解码器型LLM在层级间系统性编码表征偏见，可通过导向向量有效减轻。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLM中政治偏见的编码方式，并提供了一种超越表层干预的去偏见方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their
widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain
about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly
along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework
for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis
of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test
(PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer
activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive
activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple
ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing.
Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias
across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based
mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded
in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level
output interventions.

Conclusion: BiasGym在减少现实刻板印象和探索虚构关联方面表现出色，适用于安全干预和可解释性研究。

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

Motivation: 当前放射学报告的质量评估依赖资深医生手动评分，成本高且易受主观因素影响，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: Sqator通过分析初级报告与资深报告之间的修订文本片段（span），计算修订的重要性得分，并合并得出最终质量评分。

Result: 在12,013份放射学报告上的实验表明，Sqator能生成与资深医生判断一致的评分，且修订片段的重要性得分具有一致性。

Conclusion: Sqator提供了一种高效、自动化的放射学报告质量评估方法，减少了人工依赖并提高了评分的客观性。

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the
junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one
junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and
junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors.
Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias,
the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a
Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores
automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we
try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text
spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to
analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans.
Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised
spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by
merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of
12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve
competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be
also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Result: 实验发现LLMs内部存在西方主导偏见和文化扁平化，低资源文化因训练数据有限偏见较少。

Conclusion: 为未来减少文化偏见和提升LLMs文化理解奠定基础，代码和数据公开。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

Conclusion: ASPD为高效LLM并行推理设定了新基准，适用于延迟敏感场景。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

Result: 在多方言阿拉伯语ASR挑战中取得最佳成绩，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 弱监督与微调结合能有效克服数据稀缺，为低资源、多方言语言提供高质量ASR解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural
human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning
context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models
struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by
exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting
different trends across models and languages.

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法在相同最终预算下优于固定预算基线，提高了准确性和令牌效率。

Conclusion: 渐进约束是一种有效的归纳偏差，可训练高效的推理模型。

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining
computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely
on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural
progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we
propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous
token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to
first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more
concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances
three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and
formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,
SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training
consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,
achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We
further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,
showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for
training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoDIT是一种通过利用特定标记logits在生成过程中联合生成并忠实归因答案的方法，显著提升了RAG中的信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）的幻觉问题，提升其可信度，尤其是在生成答案时的忠实归因。

Method: LoDIT通过两步实现：(1) 用特定标记标识文档并利用其logits估计文档对答案的贡献；(2) 将这些贡献聚合为文档归因。

Result: 在Trust-Align基准测试中，LoDIT在多个指标上显著优于现有最先进模型，且在延迟和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: LoDIT是一种高效且鲁棒的方法，能够显著提升生成答案的忠实性和可信度。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RetroAttention是一种新的KV缓存更新技术，通过修正累积的注意力错误，提升长序列解码的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长序列解码中KV缓存的内存占用和累积注意力错误问题。

Method: 引入RetroAttention技术，通过轻量级输出缓存修正过去的注意力输出。

Result: 在长生成任务中，RetroAttention比现有方法提升1.6倍KV暴露和21.9%准确率。

Conclusion: RetroAttention有效解决了长序列解码中的性能瓶颈，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.

Result: 在测试阶段排名33/53，验证了零样本代码生成的可行性。

Conclusion: 零样本代码生成是表格问答的有效方法，未来可通过优化进一步提升性能。

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on
Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an
Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the
relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach
consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is
supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and
analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the
generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,
incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance
robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach
for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of
task-specific fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法依赖资源密集的微调（FT），可能导致知识退化且适应性受限，而TF方法提供了一种更灵活的对齐方案。

Method: 通过预解码、解码中和解码后三个阶段分类TF对齐方法，并从LLMs和多模态LLMs（MLLMs）的角度详细分析其机制。

Result: 总结了TF对齐方法的优缺点，并指出其在开源和闭源环境中的适应性优势。

Conclusion: 本文为实践者提供了指导，并推动了更安全可靠的大语言模型的发展。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs
adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional
alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may
suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the
model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast,
training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning,
decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising
alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them
adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper
presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them
by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we
provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we
identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more
inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing
the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for
practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）作为监督者训练真实治疗师的新方法，通过识别常见治疗错误并提供针对性反馈，解决了直接应用LLM于患者时的伦理和安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用LLM于心理治疗患者存在伦理和安全风险，因此转向开发LLM作为监督者训练治疗师。同时，治疗行为缺乏绝对标准，但常见错误可识别，适合作为反馈依据。

Method: 1. 制定错误行为指南和纠正策略；2. 构建人机对话反馈数据集，模拟错误行为并由监督模型识别和反馈；3. 微调后用于真实治疗师训练。

Result: 实验表明，基于MATE数据集微调的模型能根据临床指南提供高质量反馈，适用于治疗师培训。

Conclusion: 该方法为治疗师培训提供了一种有效且安全的LLM应用途径，展示了显著潜力。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises
ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an
LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of
clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the
training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to
ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard"
for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common
therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective
triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by
this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for
mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as
standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then
constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes
during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies
mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,
the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The
detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide
high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant
potential for the therapist training scenario.

Motivation: 现有评估基准未能充分反映用户多样化和复杂的需求，通过用户问卷确定了五类任务，以填补这一差距。

Method: 提出MVISU-Bench基准测试和Aider模块，后者作为动态提示器，用于澄清用户意图和降低风险。

Result: Aider模块将整体任务成功率提升19.55%，在非伦理和交互式任务中分别提升53.52%和29.41%。

Conclusion: 实验和分析揭示了现有移动代理与用户真实需求之间的差距，MVISU-Bench和Aider为解决这一问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Given the significant advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in
reasoning and visual understanding, mobile agents are rapidly emerging to meet
users' automation needs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are
disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and
complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user
questionnaire, we identified five tasks: Multi-App, Vague, Interactive,
Single-App, and Unethical Instructions. Around these tasks, we present
\textbf{MVISU-Bench}, a bilingual benchmark that includes 404 tasks across 137
mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose Aider, a plug-and-play module that
acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for
mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has
successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate
improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions,
respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap
between existing mobile agents and real-world user expectations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的推理过程因其自回归特性难以加速，影响高效部署。现有方法多依赖额外训练，READER旨在通过创新方法解决这一问题。

Method: READER结合自重复文本和统计搜索扩展推测解码树，优化大批量下的键值缓存（KV cache），无需额外训练即可重用预训练模型。

Result: READER在推测解码方法中表现最优，速度提升超过40%，在检索增强生成等任务中实现10倍以上加速。

Conclusion: READER为LLM推理提供了一种高效、无需训练的无损加速方法，特别适合工业应用中的大批量场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each
token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the
inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant
challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been
proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often
involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce
READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel
lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by
leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative
decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work
focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for
industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during
speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for
large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding
methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse
pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method
demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as
retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模方法在主观任务中面临评价标准模糊和奖励信号不稳定的问题。

Method: 提出CPO方法，从样本评分转向比较组评分；引入CharacterArena框架，包含多轮角色扮演模拟和轨迹级比较评估。

Result: 实验证明CPO能有效减少奖励模糊性，显著提升对话质量。

Conclusion: CPO和CharacterArena为强化学习在主观任务中的应用提供了更稳健和公平的评估方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) has achieved notable success in
tasks with objectively verifiable answers (e.g., code generation, mathematical
reasoning), yet struggles with open-ended subjective tasks like role-playing
dialogue. Traditional reward modeling approaches, which rely on independent
sample-wise scoring, face dual challenges: subjective evaluation criteria and
unstable reward signals.Motivated by the insight that human evaluation
inherently combines explicit criteria with implicit comparative judgments, we
propose Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO). CPO redefines the reward
evaluation paradigm by shifting from sample-wise scoring to comparative
group-wise scoring.Building on the same principle, we introduce the
CharacterArena evaluation framework, which comprises two stages:(1)
Contextualized Multi-turn Role-playing Simulation, and (2) Trajectory-level
Comparative Evaluation. By operationalizing subjective scoring via objective
trajectory comparisons, CharacterArena minimizes contextual bias and enables
more robust and fair performance evaluation. Empirical results on
CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena confirm that CPO effectively
mitigates reward ambiguity and leads to substantial improvements in dialogue
quality.

TL;DR: 提出一种融合所有中间层的架构，通过全局和Transformer Softmax加权策略，提升低资源语言性能，仅用英语数据训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在低资源语言上性能下降的问题，避免依赖多语言数据。

Method: 融合所有中间层，采用全局和Transformer Softmax加权策略，映射到LLM嵌入空间。

Result: 在XNLI等任务上显著优于基线，低资源语言性能提升明显。

Conclusion: 提供了一种高效、可扩展的多语言LLM改进方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades
significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training.
While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the
Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically
use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses
all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the
LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for
overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns
token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's
embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is
trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.
Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,
our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge
baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala
classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements
across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific
gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to
71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more
capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

Motivation: 流程工业中的知识管理（KM）面临事件日志碎片化的挑战，导致相关记录无法有效关联，阻碍了解决方案的推荐。

Method: 将记录链接问题建模为CDCR任务，结合NLI和STS，并引入因果推理（CI），开发了一种适用于流程工业的RL模型。

Result: RL模型在性能上优于NLI和STS基线方法，分别提升了28%和27%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过领域适配和增强推理能力，CDCR模型可以有效应用于流程工业，提升数据质量和日志记录的连通性。

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and
27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation
of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and
connectivity in shift logs.

Conclusion: SinLlama是首个明确支持僧伽罗语的开源解码器LLM，为低资源语言提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as Sinhala are often overlooked by open-source
Large Language Models (LLMs). In this research, we extend an existing
multilingual LLM (Llama-3-8B) to better serve Sinhala. We enhance the LLM
tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training
on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This
is the very first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support.
When SinLlama was instruction fine-tuned for three text classification tasks,
it outperformed base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B by a significant
margin.

Result: OdysseyBench能有效挑战现有LLM代理，提供更准确的评估。

Conclusion: OdysseyBench是推动LLM代理在现实生产力场景中发展的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are
self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual
dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse
office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our
benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks
derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly
synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential
information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step
reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,
we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation
of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,
task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates
that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing
more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts
compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will
serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of
LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release
OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

Motivation: 随着任务复杂化，自然语言指令中的逻辑结构日益复杂，但LLMs在此类逻辑丰富指令上的表现尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出LogicIFGen框架，从代码函数生成可验证指令，并构建LogicIFEval基准测试（包含426条逻辑丰富指令）。

Result: 实验表明，当前最先进的LLMs在LogicIFEval上表现不佳，仅能正确遵循不到60%的指令。

Conclusion: LLMs在逻辑丰富指令的遵循能力上存在显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities
such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the
logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly
intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions
remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a
scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code
functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,
nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of
complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark
comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate
that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the
instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the
instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following
ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

TL;DR: 论文揭示了扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）在解码过程中存在的时间振荡现象，并提出两种利用时间一致性的方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>

Motivation: 当前解码策略丢弃了中间预测信息，而研究发现正确结果往往出现在中间步骤，但被后续去噪步骤覆盖。

Method: 1) 时间自一致性投票：训练无关的解码策略，聚合去噪步骤的预测；2) 时间一致性强化：使用时间语义熵（TSE）作为奖励信号，鼓励稳定生成。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用负TSE奖励时，Countdown数据集上平均提升24.7%；结合准确性奖励，GSM8K、MATH500、SVAMP和Countdown分别提升2.0%、4.3%、6.6%和25.3%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了dLLMs中时间动态的潜力，并提供了两种简单有效的工具来利用这一潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate
predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical
phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the
middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this
issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal
consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time
decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select
the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal
Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a
measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward
signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative
TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the
Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we
achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and
25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped
potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective
tools to harness them.

Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDDI框架通过结合分子图像信息和功能基序序列，提升了药物-药物相互作用（DDI）预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在功能基序表示学习上存在瓶颈，而DDI主要由基序相互作用引起，因此需要一种更全面的表示方法。

Method: ImageDDI将分子分解为功能基序，结合全局分子图像信息，使用基于Transformer的编码器和自适应特征融合技术。

Result: 实验表明ImageDDI在多个数据集上优于现有方法，并在2D和3D图像增强场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: ImageDDI通过整合局部和全局结构信息，显著提升了DDI预测性能。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务无关且硬件无关的流程，通过Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation（NTKD）提升混合光学神经网络（ONN）的性能，解决了训练精度差距和仿真与实现差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合光学神经网络（ONN）在实时、功耗受限系统中具有能效优势，但其应用受限于训练精度差距和仿真与实现差异。现有方法缺乏通用性。

Method: 提出任务无关和硬件无关的流程，包括预训练阶段的模型精度估计和训练阶段的NTKD方法，用于对齐光学模型与电子教师网络，并在实现后微调数字后端。

Result: 在多个数据集和硬件配置上实验表明，该流程显著提升了ONN性能，支持仿真和实际部署。

Conclusion: 该流程有效解决了ONN的通用性和性能问题，为其实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAViS是一个多智能体协作框架，用于生成长序列视频，通过分阶段协作和3E原则提升视频质量、辅助能力和表现力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长序列视频生成框架存在辅助能力差、视觉质量不佳和表现力有限的问题，MAViS旨在解决这些限制。

Method: MAViS采用多智能体协作框架，分阶段处理脚本编写、镜头设计、角色建模等，并遵循3E原则（探索、检查、增强）。

Result: 实验表明，MAViS在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力上达到最优，支持多模态输出（视频、叙事和背景音乐）。

Conclusion: MAViS是首个支持多模态设计的框架，能通过简短用户提示生成高质量长序列视频，提升用户创意。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON是一个统一的多服装扩散框架，通过联合建模上下服装和人物身份，解决了现有虚拟试衣方法在保留身份和服装保真度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试衣方法通常分开处理上下服装，依赖繁重的预处理，且难以保留人物特定特征（如纹身、配饰和体型），导致真实感和灵活性受限。

Method: 提出三个关键模块：服装表示模块（GRM）捕捉服装语义，人物表示模块（PRM）编码身份和姿态线索，A-DiT融合模块通过扩散变压器整合服装、人物和文本提示特征。

Result: 在VITON-HD和DressCode基准测试中，MuGa-VTON在定性和定量评估上均优于现有方法，生成高保真且保留身份的结果。

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON为实际虚拟试衣应用提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，支持基于提示的细粒度服装修改。

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CObL的扩散模型，用于从图像中推断出遮挡有序的对象层堆叠表示，无需用户提示或预先知道对象数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务需要将像素分组为对象并理解其空间关系，包括遮挡和深度信息。

Method: 使用基于扩散的架构CObL，结合Stable Diffusion作为自然对象的先验，并通过推理时指导确保推断的层能复合回输入图像。

Result: CObL在合成图像上训练后，能零样本泛化到真实世界照片，且无需用户提示或预先知道对象数量。

Conclusion: CObL在无监督对象中心表示学习中表现出色，且不受训练场景的限制。

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

TL;DR: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在序列视觉叙事处理中存在表面识别与深层叙事推理的显著差距。研究发现，尽管大型多模态模型擅长单面板解读，但在时间因果性和跨面板连贯性方面表现不佳。论文提出了一种新的评估框架，结合多模态标注和跨模态嵌入分析，揭示了VLMs的局限性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前VLMs在长叙事理解中的不足，特别是在时间因果性和跨面板连贯性方面的缺陷，为提升叙事智能提供基础。

Method: 提出综合评估框架，包括多模态标注、跨模态嵌入分析和检索增强评估，应用于《Re:Zero》漫画的308个标注面板。

Result: 当前模型缺乏真正的故事级智能，尤其在非线性叙事、角色一致性和长序列因果推理方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 为评估叙事智能提供了基础和方法论，同时揭示了VLMs在深层序列理解中的局限性。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

*Mansi Phute,Ravikumar Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR是一种通过优化视觉输入实现行为控制的新方法，无需侵入模型内部，适用于各种VLM服务模式，且效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM行为控制方法（如系统提示）易检测且效果有限，而基于激活的转向向量需要侵入模型内部，不适用于API服务和闭源部署。VISOR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: VISOR通过设计通用的转向图像，诱导目标激活模式，实现行为控制。验证了其在LLaVA-1.5-7B模型上的有效性。

Result: VISOR在三种对齐任务中表现优异，单张150KB图像即可实现1-2%的性能匹配，负面转向效果更显著（高达25%）。同时不影响其他任务性能（99.9%）。

Conclusion: VISOR为多模态模型控制提供了新思路，同时揭示了视觉转向攻击的安全漏洞，亟需防御措施。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

TL;DR: 该研究通过利用平行文本行图像（近代日本文本与现代日文字体的配对）来扩充训练数据集，解决了近代日本文献转录中数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近代日本文献具有重要的历史价值，但转录工作耗时且数据稀缺，限制了OCR系统的训练效果。

Method: 提出了一种基于距离的目标函数，最小化平行图像对的自注意力特征差距，探索了欧几里得距离和最大均值差异（MMD）作为域适应度量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在使用欧几里得距离和MMD时，分别将字符错误率（CER）降低了2.23%和3.94%。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了自注意力表示的质量，从而提升了历史文献OCR的性能。

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了Calibration Attention (CalAttn)，一种基于ViT的CLS令牌学习自适应实例温度的模块，显著降低校准误差，且几乎不增加参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险敏感应用中，Vision Transformers的概率校准至关重要，而现有方法（如温度缩放）依赖全局标量且需要验证集。

Method: 引入CalAttn模块，直接从ViT的CLS令牌学习每个实例的自适应温度，无需额外验证集。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CalAttn将校准误差降低至多4倍，且仅增加0.1%的参数，学习到的温度值集中在1.0附近。

Conclusion: CalAttn简单高效，适用于多种架构，提供更可信的概率而不牺牲准确性。

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中标注数据有限和领域偏移是常见挑战，现有方法通常针对单一任务，性能受限。本文旨在开发一个通用框架，解决半监督学习、领域泛化和无监督领域适应问题。

Method: 采用DTLP-Net框架，包含一个学生模型和两个多样化教师模型，通过解耦训练和动量更新生成可靠伪标签，并结合数据增强和标签传播技术提升模型性能。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，DTLP-Net在SSMIS、UMDA和Semi-MDG任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DTLP-Net框架能够有效解决医学图像分割中的多种挑战，为更复杂的半监督学习场景提供了潜力。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

TL;DR: FLIPNET通过切换恢复和退化模式，解决了盲脸恢复中扩散先验的适应性问题，提升了真实性和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散先验模型在盲脸恢复中存在适应性问题，主要源于高质量与低质量图像以及合成与真实图像之间的差距。

Method: FLIPNET采用统一网络，切换恢复和退化模式，分别处理图像恢复和真实退化模拟。

Result: FLIPNET在真实性和保真度上优于现有方法，并能更好地模拟真实退化。

Conclusion: FLIPNET通过双模式设计有效解决了盲脸恢复中的适应性问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

Conclusion: AutoSAME通过结合分割和关键点定位，实现了与临床指南一致的LV指标测量，为心血管疾病诊断提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Motivation: 现有方法难以独立控制视频的四个关键元素（前景主体、背景视频、人体轨迹和动作模式），限制了生成的灵活性和可控性。

Method: 构建地面感知的3D世界坐标系，在3D空间中进行运动编辑；通过2D轨迹反投影、速度对齐和方向调整实现轨迹控制；动作由运动库或文本生成；基于扩散变换模型，注入主体、背景和运动控制信号。

Result: 在基准数据集和实际案例中，方法在元素可控性和视频质量上达到最优。

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成高度可控且逼真的人体视频，为灵活的视频合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档理解中表现出色，但其推理过程缺乏透明性，难以在高风险领域（如法律、金融和医疗）中确保可靠性和可信度。现有方法存在灾难性遗忘、适应性差和跨领域任务泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: DocThinker采用基于规则的强化学习框架，通过策略学习动态优化推理策略，生成可解释的中间结果（如结构化推理过程、重述问题、支持答案的兴趣区域和最终答案），并结合多目标规则奖励和KL约束优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DocThinker显著提高了泛化能力，同时生成更可解释和易于理解的推理步骤。

Conclusion: 强化学习是提升多模态大语言模型在文档理解中可解释性和适应性的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

Motivation: 现有DETR方法中随机初始化的查询缺乏明确语义，导致检测性能不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出QueryCraft框架，包含ACTOR（跨模态Transformer）和PDQD（感知蒸馏查询解码器），通过语言引导和对象类别感知生成语义化查询。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中取得最优性能，并展示强泛化能力。

Conclusion: QueryCraft通过语义化查询初始化显著提升HOI检测性能，为未来研究提供新思路。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适配方法因模型特定设计和计算需求高而迁移性有限，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出TransMiter，以无监督方式捕捉预训练与微调模型间的知识差距，并通过少量层实现跨模型迁移。

Result: 实验表明TransMiter能高效迁移知识，保持泛化能力，且性能常超越微调模型。

Conclusion: TransMiter为视觉语言模型提供了一种高效、通用的适配方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督和自增强策略有效提升了手持视频去模糊的性能，适用于真实场景。

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Method: 设计了帧级和视频级的任务特定提示，结合正交梯度校正（OGC）模块和视频上下文解码器。

Result: HVPL模型在避免灾难性遗忘方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HVPL通过分层提示学习有效解决了视频实例分割中的类别遗忘问题。

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Conclusion: AME是一种即插即用的模块，适用于多种视觉-语言蒸馏框架，并能提供更紧的泛化误差界。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

Result: 实验表明，HiWL在水印提取准确率上比现有方法高7.6%，且处理速度极快（8秒处理10万张图像）。

Conclusion: HiWL是一种高效且通用的深度图像水印方法，显著提升了水印技术的性能。

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

Conclusion: MMIF-AMIN在多模态医学图像融合任务中表现出色，并可扩展至其他图像融合任务。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

Conclusion: PADReg通过物理约束实现了更准确的解剖对齐，优于仅依赖图像相似性的方法。

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种仅使用RGB图像的越野自由空间检测方法ROD，避免了LiDAR数据的高计算需求，实现了50 FPS的高推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越野场景中自由空间检测因边界模糊而更具挑战性，现有方法依赖LiDAR数据导致推理速度慢，不适合实时应用。

Method: 利用预训练的Vision Transformer（ViT）提取RGB图像特征，并设计轻量高效的解码器。

Result: 在ORFD和RELLIS-3D数据集上达到新的SOTA，推理速度达50 FPS。

Conclusion: ROD方法在精度和速度上均显著优于现有模型，适用于实时越野自由空间检测。

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的无参考视频质量评估方法CBAND，用于检测和量化视频压缩中的带状伪影，并发布了一个新的开放视频数据集LIVE-YT-Banding。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高清晰度视频压缩中的带状伪影严重影响了视频质量，现有数据集仅针对静态图像，无法捕捉时间动态，因此需要系统性研究和新的数据集。

Method: 创建了LIVE-YT-Banding数据集，包含160个AV1编码视频，收集了7,200条主观评价；提出CBAND模型，利用深度神经网络嵌入的自然图像统计特性。

Result: CBAND在带状伪影预测性能上显著优于现有模型，且速度更快；还可作为可微损失函数优化视频去带状伪影模型。

Conclusion: CBAND和LIVE-YT-Banding数据集为视频质量评估和去带状伪影研究提供了有效工具，推动了该领域的进展。

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

Motivation: 现有方法在修复视觉识别模型的系统性错误时，常因分布偏移和语义错误而效果不佳，需要一种更有效的修复策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了模型在罕见情况下的错误，提升了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的修复策略有效且不会引入新错误，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应置信度损失（ACW）和边界预期校准误差（BECE）指标，用于提升眼内透镜结构分割的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度分割网络对所有像素平等加权，忽略了透镜结构子区域的不均匀性和边界区域的分割校准问题。

Method: 通过置信度阈值将透镜结构子区域分组，应用区域加权损失，并设计自适应置信度阈值优化算法。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，如IoU提升6.13%，DSC增加4.33%，BECE降低4.79%。

Conclusion: ACW和BECE有效提升了透镜结构分割的精度和校准性能。

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种模拟社交网络视频共享管道的框架，用于生成压缩视频数据，以提升深度伪造检测器在真实场景中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交网络平台对视频的专有压缩导致深度伪造检测器在真实场景中表现不佳，而直接模拟这些压缩过程存在技术限制。

Method: 通过从少量上传视频中估计压缩和调整参数，构建本地模拟器，生成平台特定的压缩视频数据。

Result: 实验表明，模拟数据与真实上传视频的退化模式高度匹配，且基于模拟数据微调的检测器性能接近真实数据训练的检测器。

Conclusion: 该框架为缩小实验室训练与真实部署间的差距提供了可扩展的解决方案，尤其在压缩视频领域具有重要意义。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

TL;DR: ROOMELSA是一个新的基准测试，用于评估系统在复杂场景中根据自然语言描述检索3D模型的能力，包含大量场景和查询数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D检索系统在简单场景中表现良好，但在复杂、模糊的现实场景中表现不足，需要更强大的视觉与语言理解能力。

Method: ROOMELSA通过全景房间图像中的特定区域和自然语言查询，从大型数据库中检索对应的3D模型。

Result: 实验表明，粗粒度检索已基本解决，但细粒度检索仍具挑战性；轻量级CLIP模型表现良好，但在材料、结构和上下文细节上仍有不足。

Conclusion: ROOMELSA为推进现实世界3D识别系统提供了新基准，强调了视觉与语言理解的紧密结合的重要性。

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物姿态估计在生态监测、行为分析和智能畜牧管理中具有重要意义，但由于物种形态多样性和标注数据有限，传统方法面临挑战。

Method: 提出DiffPose-Animal，将姿态估计重新定义为扩散模型的去噪过程，并利用大语言模型提取全局解剖先验和局部关键点语义，通过交叉注意力模块融合图像特征。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在物种多样性、复杂背景和关键点缺失等挑战性场景下表现出色。

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal通过结合生成模型和语义先验，显著提升了动物姿态估计的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均匀锐化强度忽略了纹理变化，导致视频质量下降，且增加的比特率缺乏优化分配方法。

Method: 使用编码树单元（CTU）分区掩模作为先验信息，指导并约束增加的比特分配。

Result: 实验证明，该模型在定性和定量上均有效。

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp在提升视频感知质量的同时，优化了比特率分配。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂姿态变化和单目设置下的遮挡恢复方面表现不佳，导致边界过渡不自然和遮挡区域重建不准确。

Method: 构建双向变形模型结合刚性和非刚性变换，引入部分姿态嵌入机制和关键帧姿态检索插值，结合注意力机制建模动态纹理变化。

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF通过创新的变形和姿态建模方法，有效提升了动态人体渲染的质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

Result: 生成了一个公开数据集，可用于跨年龄人脸识别和合成图像检测的基准测试。

Conclusion: 该方法简单实用，能有效生成年龄变化的人脸图像并保留身份，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are
available at the project page https://www.idiap.ch/paper/agesynth/

Motivation: 现有轻量级语义分割方法在实时推理中存在类别表示与图像特征不对齐的局限性，导致像素级分类假设在高效场景中难以成立。

Method: 提出耦合双分支偏移学习范式，显式学习特征和类别偏移，动态优化类别表示和图像特征，并构建了高效网络OffSeg。

Result: 在四个数据集（ADE20K、Cityscapes等）上实验表明，该方法显著提升了性能（如ADE20K上SegFormer-B0提升2.7% mIoU），且仅需少量额外参数。

Conclusion: 偏移学习范式能有效解决类别与特征不对齐问题，且无需额外架构改动即可应用于现有方法。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M
additional parameters required.

Result: TARA实现了无需训练的多概念组合，并有效保留各概念的视觉身份。

Conclusion: TARA通过避免模块间干扰，提升了多概念生成的效率和效果。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

Result: 在LIVE数据集上，ATR指标与人类感知的Spearman相关性达-0.93（模糊）和-0.95（噪声），分类准确率超97%，整体系统预测R2为0.892，RMSE为5.17 DMOS。

Conclusion: 该框架为图像退化的分类和量化提供了高效的双重工具，具有高预测精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

Motivation: 高频分量对视频清晰度和真实感至关重要，但会增加编码比特率，导致带宽和存储成本上升。

Method: 使用FFPN预测最优高频预处理策略，并通过伪标签训练FFPN，比较不同预处理类型和强度的率失真性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上的评估显示，该框架能显著提升视觉质量并节省比特率。

Conclusion: 该框架在视频编码中实现了比特率和主观质量的最优权衡。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released
at:https://github.com/Amazingren/maskclu.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Conclusion: 通过几何化建模和流形学习，新方法能够更准确地描述数据分布和类间依赖关系，为LiDAR地点识别提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Motivation: 面部变形攻击（MAD）是面部识别安全中的关键挑战，现有方法多依赖微调，忽视了基础模型（如CLIP）的直接通用部署潜力。

Method: 通过聚合多样化的文本提示嵌入，更好地将模型内部表示与MAD任务对齐，捕捉更丰富的攻击或真实样本线索。

Result: 结果显示，提示聚合显著提升了零样本检测性能，验证了通过高效提示工程利用基础模型内置多模态知识的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，无需额外训练的基础模型可通过提示工程直接应用于MAD任务，为安全领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Conclusion: 布局条件能有效提升故事生成任务的细粒度控制和一致性，Lay2Story框架和数据集为未来研究提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

Result: 实验表明TCSSM优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TCSSM有效解决了CDVQA中的领域偏移问题，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

*Ding Xia,Naoto Inoue,Qianru Qiu,Kotaro Kikuchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在颜色推荐任务中的应用，提出了一种名为ColorGPT的管道，通过系统测试颜色表示和提示工程技术，验证了LLMs在颜色调色板完成和生成任务中的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统颜色推荐方法因设计复杂性和数据限制表现不佳，研究旨在验证预训练LLMs是否能成为更优的设计工具。

Method: 开发了ColorGPT管道，系统测试多种颜色表示并应用提示工程技术，专注于颜色调色板完成和生成任务。

Result: 实验表明，ColorGPT在颜色建议准确性和调色板分布上优于现有方法，同时在颜色多样性和相似性方面也有所提升。

Conclusion: 预训练LLMs在颜色推荐任务中表现出色，ColorGPT为设计领域提供了新的高效工具。

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

TL;DR: KFFocus提出了一种高效压缩视频令牌并突出关键帧信息的方法，通过非均匀采样和动态压缩比，显著提升了视频LLMs的计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频LLMs在压缩视频时采用均匀采样和固定压缩比，忽略了关键帧的不均匀分布，导致重要信息丢失。

Method: KFFocus采用经典视频压缩原则识别关键帧，动态分配压缩比，并引入时空建模模块编码时空关系。

Result: 在长视频场景的实验中，KFFocus显著优于现有方法，提高了计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: KFFocus通过优化视频令牌压缩和时空建模，为视频LLMs提供了更高效和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动表示无法从多尺度捕捉运动且缺乏组合灵活性，限制了复杂模式建模和多样化生成任务的能力。

Method: 引入MSQ方法，通过多尺度离散化空间和时间维度的运动序列，使用不同编码器捕捉空间粒度和时间插值，并建立生成掩码建模模型。

Result: MSQ实现了无需专门设计或重新训练的运动标记无缝组合，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSQ为运动生成提供了更灵活和高效的多尺度表示，显著提升了复杂运动建模和多样化任务的能力。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: 通过组合小核扩展ERF并保持AGD是一种更高效的方法，UniConvNet在多种任务中表现出色，具有通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are

Result: 在三个低光基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在质量和定量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 减少ICR能显著提升低光图像增强效果，IRetinex模型为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

Motivation: 现有半监督方法依赖学生模型且忽视认知偏差，生成高置信度伪标签困难。

Method: UC-Seg框架包含双子网，采用交叉子网一致性保持（CCP）策略和不确定性感知伪标签生成（UPG）组件。

Result: 在多种医学图像分割任务中表现优于现有方法，具有更高的分割精度和泛化性能。

Conclusion: UC-Seg有效解决了半监督医学图像分割中的认知偏差和伪标签生成问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容越来越逼真，人工标注变得耗时且不可靠，亟需一种能有效利用大规模无标签数据的方法。

Method: DPGNet包含文本引导的跨域对齐和课程驱动的伪标签生成模块，并通过跨域知识蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在11个数据集上，DPGNet比现有方法性能提升6.3%。

Conclusion: DPGNet通过结合文本引导和伪标签生成，成功解决了深度伪造检测中的标注挑战。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Motivation: 现有研究独立增强空间或时间理解，但缺乏两者的整合。

Method: 通过将观测中的关键点视觉轨迹投影到深度图上，同时捕获空间和时间信息。

Result: 在SimplerEnv中，任务解决率比SpatialVLA提高4%，比TraceVLA提高19%。

Conclusion: 该方法在少量训练数据下表现优异，适合数据收集困难的现实应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

Conclusion: 该方法通过特定于提示和噪声种子的个性化步骤，显著提升了文本到图像个性化的效果。

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

Result: 实验显示，该方法在模拟真实场景中EBI达到68.91，显著提升了实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了视频异常检测在动态环境中的适用性和准确性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，VLM-3D的感知精度提升了12.8%。

Conclusion: VLM-3D通过端到端设计和联合损失，有效提升了自动驾驶场景中的3D感知能力。

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提升了认证系统的安全性，还为理解欺骗攻击的行为模式提供了新视角。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed
to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics
employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED首次实现移动设备上的实时720p视频VAE解码，适用于大多数视频VAE，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

Conclusion: HumanOLAT将推动未来研究，支持重光照和渲染技术的严格基准测试与进步。

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

TL;DR: 论文提出Fier方法，通过细粒度KV缓存检索提升长上下文LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存读取延迟随上下文长度增加显著，影响长上下文LLM推理效率，现有方法因稀疏性导致检索不准确。

Method: 使用1-bit量化键估计每个token的重要性，实现高效精确的KV缓存检索。

Result: Fier仅用11%缓存预算即匹配全KV性能，解码延迟降低1.2×至1.5×。

Conclusion: Fier通过细粒度检索显著提升长上下文LLM推理效率。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache reading latency increases significantly with context
lengths, hindering the efficiency of long-context LLM inference. To address
this, previous works propose retaining a small fraction of KV cache based on
token importance. For example, KV eviction uses static heuristics to retain
tokens, while KV retrieval dynamically selects query-relevant tokens for more
adaptive cache management. However, we observe that important tokens are often
sparsely distributed across the long context. This sparsity makes existing
page-level KV retrieval inaccurate, as each page may include irrelevant tokens
and miss critical ones. In this work, we propose Fier, a
\underline{Fi}ne-Grained and \underline{E}fficient KV cache
\underline{R}etrieval method. Fier uses 1-bit quantized keys to estimate the
importance of each token, resulting in efficient and precise retrieval.
Experiments show that Fier matches full KV performance using only 11\% of the
cache budget across various long-context tasks, reducing decoding latency by
1.2$\times$ to 1.5$\times$.

TL;DR: SRP是一个统一预测建模框架，通过捕获关系数据库中的一元和复合依赖关系，提升表格数据预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关系数据库（RDBs）广泛使用，但其结构限制了深度学习方法的利用。现有研究主要关注主键-外键关系的一元依赖，忽略了复合依赖关系。

Method: SRP框架通过特征合成、信息检索和图消息传播，捕获一元和复合依赖关系，并学习相邻模式进行预测。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上的实验证明SRP的有效性，并展示了其在工业场景中的潜在应用价值。

Conclusion: SRP通过引入新的检索机制，显著提升了关系数据库的预测能力，为未来应用提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) have become the industry standard for storing
massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model
behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive
experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP
and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released
at https://github.com/NingLi670/SRP.

<details>

Motivation: 现代AI系统复杂性增加，硬件效率提升受限，需跨栈优化以提高效率。

Method: 采用跨栈方法，包括PipeRAG（算法）、RAGO（系统）、Chameleon（硬件）优化RAG；FANNS和Falcon优化向量搜索；MicroRec和FleetRec优化推荐系统。

Result: 提出了针对RAG、向量搜索和推荐系统的多层面优化方案，显著提升效率。

Conclusion: 跨栈优化是提升ML系统效率的有效途径，未来需进一步探索算法与硬件的协同设计。

Abstract: Today, two major trends are shaping the evolution of ML systems. First,
modern AI systems are becoming increasingly complex, often integrating
components beyond the model itself. A notable example is Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), which incorporates not only multiple models but also vector
databases, leading to heterogeneity in both system components and underlying
hardware. Second, with the end of Moore's Law, achieving high system efficiency
is no longer feasible without accounting for the rapid evolution of the
hardware landscape.
  Building on the observations above, this thesis adopts a cross-stack approach
to improving ML system efficiency, presenting solutions that span algorithms,
systems, and hardware. First, it introduces several pioneering works about RAG
serving efficiency across the computing stack. PipeRAG focuses on
algorithm-level improvements, RAGO introduces system-level optimizations, and
Chameleon explores heterogeneous accelerator systems for RAG. Second, this
thesis investigates algorithm-hardware co-design for vector search.
Specifically, FANNS and Falcon optimize quantization-based and graph-based
vector search, the two most popular paradigms of retrieval algorithms. Third,
this thesis addresses the serving efficiency of recommender systems, another
example of vector-centric ML systems, where the memory-intensive lookup
operations on embedding vector tables often represent a major performance
bottleneck. MicroRec and FleetRec propose solutions at the hardware and system
levels, respectively, optimizing both data movement and computation to enhance
the efficiency of large-scale recommender models.

Motivation: 高维向量空间中的近似最近邻搜索（ANNS）在现实中有广泛应用，但图索引的开销随着数据量增长和动态调整需求增加而显著上升，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 提出GNN-Descent算法加速k-NN图初始化，设计通用计算过程CFS支持多种修剪策略，并开发异步GPU-CPU-磁盘索引框架处理超大规模数据。

Result: 在7个真实数据集上的实验表明，Tagore实现了1.32x-112.79x的加速，同时保持索引质量。

Conclusion: Tagore通过GPU加速和优化算法，显著提升了图索引的构建效率，适用于大规模动态ANNS场景。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional vector spaces
has a wide range of real-world applications. Numerous methods have been
proposed to handle ANNS efficiently, while graph-based indexes have gained
prominence due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, the indexing
overhead of graph-based indexes remains substantial. With exponential growth in
data volume and increasing demands for dynamic index adjustments, this overhead
continues to escalate, posing a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce
Tagore, a fast library accelerated by GPUs for graph indexing, which has
powerful capabilities of constructing refinement-based graph indexes such as
NSG and Vamana. We first introduce GNN-Descent, a GPU-specific algorithm for
efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph initialization. GNN-Descent speeds up
the similarity comparison by a two-phase descent procedure and enables highly
parallelized neighbor updates. Next, aiming to support various k-NN graph
pruning strategies, we formulate a universal computing procedure termed CFS and
devise two generalized GPU kernels for parallel processing complex dependencies
in neighbor relationships. For large-scale datasets exceeding GPU memory
capacity, we propose an asynchronous GPU-CPU-disk indexing framework with a
cluster-aware caching mechanism to minimize the I/O pressure on the disk.
Extensive experiments on 7 real-world datasets exhibit that Tagore achieves
1.32x-112.79x speedup while maintaining the index quality.

Conclusion: 语义单元框架为生态知识合成、证据注释和跨领域整合提供了基础，支持可重复的工作流程和AI-ready研究。

Abstract: Ecological research increasingly relies on integrating heterogeneous datasets
and knowledge to explain and predict complex phenomena. Yet, differences in
data types, terminology, and documentation often hinder interoperability,
reuse, and causal understanding. We present the Semantic Units Framework, a
novel, domain-agnostic semantic modelling approach applied here to ecological
data and knowledge in compliance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) and CLEAR (Cognitively interoperable, semantically
Linked, contextually Explorable, easily Accessible, human-Readable and
-interpretable) Principles. The framework models data and knowledge as modular,
logic-aware semantic units: single propositions (statement units) or coherent
groups of propositions (compound units). Statement units can model
measurements, observations, or universal relationships, including causal ones,
and link to methods and evidence. Compound units group related statement units
into reusable, semantically coherent knowledge objects. Implemented using RDF,
OWL, and knowledge graphs, semantic units can be serialized as FAIR Digital
Objects with persistent identifiers, provenance, and semantic interoperability.
We show how universal statement units build ecological causal networks, which
can be composed into causal maps and perspective-specific subnetworks. These
support causal reasoning, confounder detection (back-door), effect
identification with unobserved confounders (front-door), application of
do-calculus, and alignment with Bayesian networks, structural equation models,
and structural causal models. By linking fine-grained empirical data to
high-level causal reasoning, the Semantic Units Framework provides a foundation
for ecological knowledge synthesis, evidence annotation, cross-domain
integration, reproducible workflows, and AI-ready ecological research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的SQL查询重写方法难以处理复杂查询和新模式，且无法完全捕捉有效的重写策略。

Method: E3-Rewrite框架结合上下文构造模块和强化学习框架，通过执行计划和演示构建提示，并设计奖励函数优化可执行性、等价性和效率。

Result: 实验表明，E3-Rewrite在多个SQL基准测试中，查询执行时间减少25.6%，成功重写率提高24.4%。

Conclusion: E3-Rewrite显著提升了SQL查询重写的性能和覆盖范围，尤其适用于复杂查询。

Abstract: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form
while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite
rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)
fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with
complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be
fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using
large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex
strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this
potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent
rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To
address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting
framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It
integrates two core components: a context construction module and a
reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution
plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide
inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting
executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,
equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable
multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes
executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.
Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in
query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL
benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites,
expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

Method: 通过分析GPU利用率、内存使用、SM利用率和张量核心使用等高低级指标，结合多工具追踪，评估NVIDIA Jetson设备在并发视觉推理任务中的性能。

Result: 研究发现，尽管GPU利用率可达100%，但SM和张量核心利用率仅为15%-30%，且CPU端事件常成为瓶颈。

Conclusion: 论文为NVIDIA边缘设备的视觉推理任务提供了关键优化建议。

Abstract: The proliferation of IoT devices and advancements in network technologies
have intensified the demand for real-time data processing at the network edge.
To address these demands, low-power AI accelerators, particularly GPUs, are
increasingly deployed for inference tasks, enabling efficient computation while
mitigating cloud-based systems' latency and bandwidth limitations. Despite
their growing deployment, GPUs remain underutilised even in computationally
intensive workloads. This underutilisation stems from the limited understanding
of GPU resource sharing, particularly in edge computing scenarios. In this
work, we conduct a detailed analysis of both high- and low-level metrics,
including GPU utilisation, memory usage, streaming multiprocessor (SM)
utilisation, and tensor core usage, to identify bottlenecks and guide
hardware-aware optimisations. By integrating traces from multiple profiling
tools, we provide a comprehensive view of resource behaviour on NVIDIA Jetson
edge devices under concurrent vision inference workloads. Our findings indicate
that while GPU utilisation can reach $100\%$ under specific optimisations,
critical low-level resources, such as SMs and tensor cores, often operate only
at $15\%$ to $30\%$ utilisation. Moreover, we observe that certain CPU-side
events, such as thread scheduling, context switching, etc., frequently emerge
as bottlenecks, further constraining overall GPU performance. We provide
several key observations for users of vision inference workloads on NVIDIA edge
devices.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖集中式训练和均匀数据，难以适应异构移动环境中的非IID数据分布，因此需要探索联邦学习在吞吐量预测中的潜力。

Method: 评估了FedAvg、FedProx和FedBN三种聚合算法，以及LSTM、CNN、CNN+LSTM和Transformer四种时间序列架构，使用五种真实数据集分析性能。

Result: FedBN在非IID条件下表现稳健；LSTM和Transformer模型在R2分数上优于CNN基线80%；Transformer收敛更快但需要更长历史窗口。

Conclusion: FedBN结合LSTM或Transformer模型在吞吐量预测中表现出色，为下一代无线网络提供了可扩展且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and adaptive network throughput prediction is essential for
latency-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive applications in 5G and emerging 6G
networks. However, most existing methods rely on centralized training with
uniformly collected data, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous mobile
environments with non-IID data distributions. This paper presents the first
comprehensive benchmarking of federated learning (FL) strategies for throughput
prediction in realistic 5G edge scenarios. We evaluate three aggregation
algorithms - FedAvg, FedProx, and FedBN - across four time-series
architectures: LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and Transformer, using five diverse
real-world datasets. We systematically analyze the effects of client
heterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length on prediction
performance. Our results reveal key trade-offs among model complexities,
convergence rates, and generalization. It is found that FedBN consistently
delivers robust performance under non-IID conditions. On the other hand, LSTM
and Transformer models outperform CNN-based baselines by up to 80% in R2
scores. Moreover, although Transformers converge in half the rounds of LSTM,
they require longer history windows to achieve a high R2, indicating higher
context dependence. LSTM is, therefore, found to achieve a favorable balance
between accuracy, rounds, and temporal footprint. To validate the end-to-end
applicability of the framework, we have integrated our FL-based predictors into
a live adaptive streaming pipeline. It is seen that FedBN-based LSTM and
Transformer models improve mean QoE scores by 11.7% and 11.4%, respectively,
over FedAvg, while also reducing the variance. These findings offer actionable
insights for building scalable, privacy-preserving, and edge-aware throughput
prediction systems in next-generation wireless networks.

Conclusion: 该调度框架在策略设计、动态资源建模和多租户服务保障方面具有实用和工程价值，有效提升了复杂条件下分布式系统的调度效率和资源管理。

Abstract: This paper addresses key challenges in task scheduling for multi-tenant
distributed systems, including dynamic resource variation, heterogeneous tenant
demands, and fairness assurance. An adaptive scheduling method based on
reinforcement learning is proposed. By modeling the scheduling process as a
Markov decision process, the study defines the state space, action space, and
reward function. A scheduling policy learning framework is designed using
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the core algorithm. This enables dynamic
perception of complex system states and real-time decision-making. Under a
multi-objective reward mechanism, the scheduler jointly optimizes task latency,
resource utilization, and tenant fairness. The coordination between the policy
network and the value network continuously refines the scheduling strategy.
This enhances overall system performance. To validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method, a series of experiments were conducted in multi-scenario
environments built using a real-world public dataset. The experiments evaluated
task latency control, resource efficiency, policy stability, and fairness. The
results show that the proposed method outperforms existing scheduling
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics. It demonstrates strong stability
and generalization ability. The proposed scheduling framework provides
practical and engineering value in policy design, dynamic resource modeling,
and multi-tenant service assurance. It effectively improves scheduling
efficiency and resource management in distributed systems under complex
conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将大型语言模型分离部署在云端和设备上的方法（P/D-Device），以解决云端资源占用和设备计算能力有限的问题，显著降低了首次响应时间（TTFT）并提升了云端吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业实践中，大型语言模型的解耦部署虽提升了性能，但解码阶段生成过多令牌会长期占用云端资源，降低吞吐量；同时，设备资源有限导致预填充阶段延迟（TTFT）随提示长度增加而显著上升。

Method: 通过将模型分离部署在云端和设备上，云端仅协助设备预填充阶段。设备在收到云端首个令牌后立即响应用户以降低TTFT，随后通过速度控制器平滑输出令牌时间（TPOT），同时设备逐步完成预填充。云端预填充阶段还可优化提示以加速设备推理。

Result: 实验显示，TTFT降低至少60%，最大TPOT约为几十毫秒，云端吞吐量提升高达15倍。

Conclusion: P/D-Device方案有效解决了云端资源占用和设备计算能力限制的问题，显著优化了性能指标。

Abstract: Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in
industrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens
generated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,
essentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due
to limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the
latency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt
length. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long
occupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to
separate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud
helps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.
Specifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with
its own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.
Then, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for
smoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the
progress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the
resource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the
prompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to
further speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,
and confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an
algorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT
decreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud
throughput increases by up to 15x.

Result: 实验成功实现了可证明安全的隐蔽射频通信，验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 研究为隐蔽通信系统的实际应用提供了基础，并提出了进一步的研究问题。

Abstract: The fundamental information-theoretic limits of covert, or low probability of
detection/intercept (LPD/LPI), communication have been extensively studied for
over a decade, resulting in the square root law (SRL): only $L\sqrt{n}$ covert
bits can be reliably transmitted over time-bandwidth product $n$, for constant
$L>0$. Transmitting more either results in detection or decoding errors. The
SRL imposes significant constraints on hardware realization of
mathematically-guaranteed covert communication. Indeed, they preclude using
standard link maintenance operations that are taken for granted in non-covert
communication. Thus, experimental validation of covert communication is
underexplored: to date, only two experimental studies of SRL-based covert
communication are available, both focusing on optical channels. Here, we report
a demonstration of provably-secure covert radio-frequency (RF) communication
using software-defined radios (SDRs). This validates theoretical predictions,
opens practical avenues for implementing covert communication systems, and
raises further research questions.

Abstract: Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) enable continuous monitoring of
physiological signals for applications ranging from chronic disease management
to emergency response. Recent advances in 6G communications, post-quantum
cryptography, and energy harvesting have the potential to enhance WBAN
performance. However, integrating these technologies into a unified, adaptive
system remains a challenge. This paper surveys some of the most well-known
Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) architectures, routing strategies, and
security mechanisms, identifying key gaps in adaptability, energy efficiency,
and quantum-resistant security. We propose a novel Large Language Model-driven
adaptive WBAN framework in which a Large Language Model acts as a cognitive
control plane, coordinating routing, physical layer selection, micro-energy
harvesting, and post-quantum security in real time. Our review highlights the
limitations of current heuristic-based designs and outlines a research agenda
for resource-constrained, 6G-ready medical systems. This approach aims to
enable ultra-reliable, secure, and self-optimizing WBANs for next-generation
mobile health applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度多智能体强化学习的流量负载感知资源管理策略（TARM），用于优化水下无线传感器网络（UWSNs）的通信效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下无线传感器网络面临恶劣通信环境、有限能量和信号传输限制等挑战，需要高效可靠的通信解决方案。

Method: 将问题建模为分散式部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（Dec-POMDP），并提出TARM策略，结合流量负载感知机制和解决方案空间优化算法。

Result: 仿真结果表明TARM在不同传输需求和碰撞概率场景下具有适应性，并能有效支持资源有限的水下网络通信。

Conclusion: TARM策略通过优化通信链路调度和传输参数，显著提升了水下网络的通信效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) represent a promising technology
that enables diverse underwater applications through acoustic communication.
However, it encounters significant challenges including harsh communication
environments, limited energy supply, and restricted signal transmission. This
paper aims to provide efficient and reliable communication in underwater
networks with limited energy and communication resources by optimizing the
scheduling of communication links and adjusting transmission parameters (e.g.,
transmit power and transmission rate). The efficient and reliable communication
multi-objective optimization problem (ERCMOP) is formulated as a decentralized
partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). A Traffic Load-Aware
Resource Management (TARM) strategy based on deep multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) is presented to address this problem. Specifically, a traffic
load-aware mechanism that leverages the overhear information from neighboring
nodes is designed to mitigate the disparity between partial observations and
global states. Moreover, by incorporating a solution space optimization
algorithm, the number of candidate solutions for the deep MARL-based
decision-making model can be effectively reduced, thereby optimizing the
computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the adaptability of
TARM in various scenarios with different transmission demands and collision
probabilities, while also validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach
in supporting efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with
limited resources.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于代理的边缘辅助移动增强现实（MAR）通信服务方法，通过LLM驱动的数字代理和用户级QoE建模，优化通信资源管理。

Motivation: 解决MAR应用中网络控制器无法获取特定信息的问题，并应对用户数据流量的动态性，提升QoE。

Method: 1. 使用LLM驱动的数字代理连接MAR服务与网络；2. 开发用户级QoE建模方法，实现个性化资源管理。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在QoE建模准确性和通信资源效率上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的代理驱动方法能有效降低通信开销并保证QoE，适用于6G中的MAR应用。

Abstract: Mobile augmented reality (MAR) is envisioned as a key immersive application
in 6G, enabling virtual content rendering aligned with the physical environment
through device pose estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel agent-driven
communication service provisioning approach for edge-assisted MAR, aiming to
reduce communication overhead between MAR devices and the edge server while
ensuring the quality of experience (QoE). First, to address the inaccessibility
of MAR application-specific information to the network controller, we establish
a digital agent powered by large language models (LLMs) on behalf of the MAR
service provider, bridging the data and function gap between the MAR service
and network domains. Second, to cope with the user-dependent and dynamic nature
of data traffic patterns for individual devices, we develop a user-level QoE
modeling method that captures the relationship between communication resource
demands and perceived user QoE, enabling personalized, agent-driven
communication resource management. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed approach outperforms conventional LLM-based QoE-aware service
provisioning methods in both user-level QoE modeling accuracy and communication
resource efficiency.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DUAL-Health的不确定性感知多模态融合框架，用于动态和嘈杂环境下的户外健康监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统户外健康监测依赖静态多模态深度学习框架，需要大量数据训练且难以捕捉细微健康变化。多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）虽具潜力，但面临噪声和模态融合挑战。

Method: 通过量化模态不确定性、定制融合权重和模态分布对齐，解决噪声和多模态融合问题。

Result: 实验表明DUAL-Health在检测准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUAL-Health为动态嘈杂环境下的健康监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Outdoor health monitoring is essential to detect early abnormal health status
for safeguarding human health and safety. Conventional outdoor monitoring
relies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive
data training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes.
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative,
utilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models
for enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based
outdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data
contains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation
noise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor
environments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer
based MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design
for fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder
accurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat
these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework,
named DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy
environments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify
modality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and
temporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with
low-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based
on quantified and calibrated uncertainty. Third, to enhance data recovery from
fluctuating noisy modalities, we align modality distributions within a common
semantic space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DUAL-Health
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂、多文件项目中因上下文限制和知识缺口导致的性能不足问题。

Method: 结合意图翻译、语义文献检索、文档合成和多代理代码生成验证，通过Claude代理框架协调。

Result: 在真实代码库中表现优于基线单代理方法，提高了单次成功率和上下文适配性。

Conclusion: 多代理系统和针对性上下文注入能显著提升性能，为LLM代码助手部署提供了实践启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating code generation
and software engineering tasks, yet they often struggle with complex,
multi-file projects due to context limitations and knowledge gaps. We propose a
novel context engineering workflow that combines multiple AI components: an
Intent Translator (GPT-5) for clarifying user requirements, an Elicit-powered
semantic literature retrieval for injecting domain knowledge, NotebookLM-based
document synthesis for contextual understanding, and a Claude Code multi-agent
system for code generation and validation. Our integrated approach leverages
intent clarification, retrieval-augmented generation, and specialized
sub-agents orchestrated via Claude's agent framework. We demonstrate that this
method significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of code assistants
in real-world repositories, yielding higher single-shot success rates and
better adherence to project context than baseline single-agent approaches.
Qualitative results on a large Next.js codebase show the multi-agent system
effectively plans, edits, and tests complex features with minimal human
intervention. We compare our system with recent frameworks like CodePlan,
MASAI, and HyperAgent, highlighting how targeted context injection and agent
role decomposition lead to state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we discuss
the implications for deploying LLM-based coding assistants in production, along
with lessons learned on context management and future research directions.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究比较开源小型语言模型（SLMs）与大型商业语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成中的性能和能效，发现SLMs在正确性上略逊于LLMs，但在能效上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业LLMs的高能耗和碳排放引发环境担忧，研究旨在探索SLMs是否能以更低能耗实现类似性能。

Method: 评估150个LeetCode编程问题，比较3个SLMs和2个LLMs在运行时间、内存使用、能耗和正确性上的表现。

Result: LLMs在所有难度级别上正确性最高，但SLMs在正确时能效更高，52%的问题中SLMs能耗与LLMs相当或更低。

Conclusion: SLMs在能效上具有优势，适合对能耗敏感的场景，但需进一步提升正确性以替代LLMs。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation. However,
commercial models like ChatGPT require significant computing power, which leads
to high energy use and carbon emissions. This has raised concerns about their
environmental impact. In this study, we evaluate open-source Small Language
Models (SLMs) trained explicitly for code generation and compare their
performance and energy efficiency against large LLMs and efficient
human-written Python code. The goal is to investigate whether SLMs can match
the performance of LLMs on certain types of programming problems while
producing more energy-efficient code. We evaluate 150 coding problems from
LeetCode, evenly distributed across three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and
hard. Our comparison includes three small open-source models, StableCode-3B,
StarCoderBase-3B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct, and two large commercial
models, GPT-4.0 and DeepSeek-Reasoner. The generated code is evaluated using
four key metrics: run-time, memory usage, energy consumption, and correctness.
We use human-written solutions as a baseline to assess the quality and
efficiency of the model-generated code. Results indicate that LLMs achieve the
highest correctness across all difficulty levels, but SLMs are often more
energy-efficient when their outputs are correct. In over 52% of the evaluated
problems, SLMs consumed the same or less energy than LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于历史构建数据和PR元数据的预测方法，优化合并管道中PR的顺序，以提高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型单体软件仓库的合并管道常因高负载成为瓶颈，现有优化方法依赖特定构建系统，缺乏通用性。

Method: 利用历史构建数据、PR元数据和上下文信息预测构建成功概率，动态优先处理可能通过的PR。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于传统的FIFO和非学习型排序策略。

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖特定构建系统，易于集成到现有自动化合并管道中。

Abstract: Integrating changes into large monolithic software repositories is a critical
step in modern software development that substantially impacts the speed of
feature delivery, the stability of the codebase, and the overall productivity
of development teams. To ensure the stability of the main branch, many
organizations use merge pipelines that test software versions before the
changes are permanently integrated. However, the load on merge pipelines is
often so high that they become bottlenecks, despite the use of parallelization.
Existing optimizations frequently rely on specific build systems, limiting
their generalizability and applicability. In this paper we propose to optimize
the order of PRs in merge pipelines using practical build predictions utilizing
only historical build data, PR metadata, and contextual information to estimate
the likelihood of successful builds in the merge pipeline. By dynamically
prioritizing likely passing PRs during peak hours, this approach maximizes
throughput when it matters most. Experiments conducted on a real-world,
large-scale project demonstrate that predictive ordering significantly
outperforms traditional first-in-first-out (FIFO), as well as
non-learning-based ordering strategies. Unlike alternative optimizations, this
approach is agnostic to the underlying build system and thus easily integrable
into existing automated merge pipelines.

Motivation: 日志级别选择对系统可观测性和性能至关重要，但现有基于LLM的预测方法忽略了代码结构和多样化日志实践。

Method: 提出OmniLLP框架，基于语义相似性和开发者所有权聚类选择上下文学习示例，优化LLM-based预测器。

Result: 相比随机选择示例的方法，OmniLLP显著提升预测准确性（AUC提高8%），综合方法达到0.88-0.96 AUC。

Conclusion: 结合软件工程特定上下文（如代码语义和开发者所有权）能显著提升日志级别预测的准确性，增强系统可维护性和可观测性。

Abstract: Developers insert logging statements in source code to capture relevant
runtime information essential for maintenance and debugging activities. Log
level choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it
controls log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and
performance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged
large language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that
demonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8).
Nevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context
examples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within
modern software projects. In this paper, we propose OmniLLP, a novel LLP
enhancement framework that clusters source files based on (1) semantic
similarity reflecting the code's functional purpose, and (2) developer
ownership cohesion. By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from
these semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent
prompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy.
Our results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings
statistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\% AUC) of the
evaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging
randomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally,
our approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context
prediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated
projects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software
engineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership
signals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware
approach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and
observability.

Conclusion: 结论表明，模型置信度和特征归因指标在幻觉检测中表现良好，为推理时检测提供了潜力。

Abstract: Language models have shown strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks
in software engineering, such as code generation, yet they suffer from
hallucinations. While hallucinations have been studied independently in natural
language and code generation, their occurrence in tasks involving code changes
which have a structurally complex and context-dependent format of code remains
largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of
hallucinations in two critical tasks involving code change to natural language
generation: commit message generation and code review comment generation. We
quantify the prevalence of hallucinations in recent language models and explore
a range of metric-based approaches to automatically detect them. Our findings
reveal that approximately 50\% of generated code reviews and 20\% of generated
commit messages contain hallucinations. Whilst commonly used metrics are weak
detectors on their own, combining multiple metrics substantially improves
performance. Notably, model confidence and feature attribution metrics
effectively contribute to hallucination detection, showing promise for
inference-time detection.\footnote{All code and data will be released upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: QuRE支持需求质量研究的透明性和协作性，推动共同标准的建立。

Abstract: Requirements quality is central to successful software and systems
engineering. Empirical research on quality defects in natural language
requirements relies heavily on datasets, ideally as realistic and
representative as possible. However, such datasets are often inaccessible,
small, or lack sufficient detail. This paper introduces QuRE (Quality in
Requirements), a new dataset comprising 2,111 industrial requirements that have
been annotated through a real-world review process. Previously used for over
five years as part of an industrial contract, this dataset is now being
released to the research community. In this work, we furthermore provide
descriptive statistics on the dataset, including measures such as lexical
diversity and readability, and compare it to existing requirements datasets and
synthetically generated requirements. In contrast to synthetic datasets, QuRE
is linguistically similar to existing ones. However, this dataset comes with a
detailed context description, and its labels have been created and used
systematically and extensively in an industrial context over a period of close
to a decade. Our goal is to foster transparency, comparability, and empirical
rigor by supporting the development of a common gold standard for requirements
quality datasets. This, in turn, will enable more sound and collaborative
research efforts in the field.

Result: 多数故障长期存在，版本中多故障共存；故障集中在少数文件中但分布均匀，热点较少。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了软件故障的实际分布特性，为优化测试和评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: Fixing software faults contributes significantly to the cost of software
maintenance and evolution. Techniques for reducing these costs require datasets
of software faults, as well as an understanding of the faults, for optimal
testing and evaluation. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of the
temporal and spatial characteristics of faults existing in 16 open-source Java
and Python projects, which form part of the Defects4J and BugsInPy datasets,
respectively. Our findings show that many faults in these software systems are
long-lived, leading to the majority of software versions having multiple
coexisting faults. This is in contrast to the assumptions of the original
datasets, where the majority of versions only identify a single fault. In
addition, we show that although the faults are found in only a small subset of
the systems, these faults are often evenly distributed amongst this subset,
leading to relatively few bug hotspots.

Method: 结合运行时行为分析和理论模型与供应商启发式方法，提出自动化工具生成优化的虚拟机配置，并比较了两种QoS建模方法（参数化建模和深度学习建模）。

Result: 通过实际部署验证，该框架在资源受限环境中显著提高了集成效率并缩短了开发时间。

Conclusion: 自动化场景生成框架为汽车行业提供了一种高效、灵活的硬件资源分配方案，解决了静态配置的局限性。

Abstract: In the automotive industry, the rise of software-defined vehicles (SDVs) has
  driven a shift toward virtualization-based architectures that consolidate
  diverse automotive workloads on a shared hardware platform. To support this
  evolution, chipset vendors provide board support packages (BSPs), hypervisor
  setups, and resource allocation guidelines. However, adapting these static
  configurations to varying system requirements and workloads remain a
  significant challenge for Tier 1 integrators.
  This paper presents an automated scenario generation framework, which helps
  automotive vendors to allocate hardware resources efficiently across multiple
  VMs. By profiling runtime behavior and integrating both theoretical models
and
  vendor heuristics, the proposed tool generates optimized hypervisor
  configurations tailored to system constraints.
  We compare two main approaches for modeling target QoS based on profiled data
  and resource allocation: domain-guided parametric modeling and deep
  learning-based modeling. We further describe our optimization strategy using
  the selected QoS model to derive efficient resource allocations. Finally, we
  report on real-world deployments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  framework in improving integration efficiency and reducing development time
in
  resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 探讨AI算法在电商平台定价与广告决策中是否会导致隐性共谋，以及其对各方的影响。

Method: 使用多智能体强化学习分析竞争，并结合亚马逊大规模数据集进行实证研究。

Result: 算法在高搜索成本下协调降低广告竞价和价格，实现三赢；平台调整佣金而非保留价可增加利润。

Conclusion: 研究缓解了对竞争性学习算法潜在危害的担忧，为政策制定和算法采用提供参考。

Abstract: Online sellers have been adopting AI learning algorithms to automatically
make product pricing and advertising decisions on e-commerce platforms. When
sellers compete using such algorithms, one concern is that of tacit collusion -
the algorithms learn to coordinate on higher than competitive. We empirically
investigate whether these concerns are valid when sellers make pricing and
advertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. Our empirical
strategy is to analyze competition with multi-agent reinforcement learning,
which we calibrate to a large-scale dataset collected from Amazon.com products.
Our first contribution is to find conditions under which learning algorithms
can facilitate win-win-win outcomes that are beneficial for consumers, sellers,
and even the platform, when consumers have high search costs. In these cases
the algorithms learn to coordinate on prices that are lower than competitive
prices. The intuition is that the algorithms learn to coordinate on lower
advertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices. Our
second contribution is an analysis of a large-scale, high-frequency
keyword-product dataset for more than 2 million products on Amazon.com. Our
estimates of consumer search costs show a wide range of costs for different
product keywords. We generate an algorithm usage and find a negative
interaction between the estimated consumer search costs and the algorithm usage
index, providing empirical evidence of beneficial collusion. Finally, we
analyze the platform's strategic response. We find that reserve price
adjustments will not increase profits for the platform, but commission
adjustments will. Our analyses help alleviate some worries about the
potentially harmful effects of competing learning algorithms, and can help
sellers, platforms and policymakers to decide on whether to adopt or regulate
such algorithms.

income groups with seventy five point four percent agreement and increase
safety although adoption remains mostly in urban areas. Environmentally
electric vehicles could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to thirty percent
per kilometre and lower particulate matter levels by twenty to twenty five
percent in Dhaka along with a three to five decibel reduction in traffic noise.
Main barriers include high purchase costs limited charging infrastructure and
low public awareness of policies. Policy recommendations include tax incentives
solar powered charging stations and battery recycling regulations. This
research concludes that strategic electric vehicle adoption could advance
Bangladesh's sustainable transportation economic resilience and public health
goals.

### [203] [Toward better understanding of energy in economics: Improvements to the Garrett thermodynamic economic model yield a robust system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08723)
*Brian P. Hanley*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文分析了Garrett等人的热力学经济模型中的关键概念问题，提出了改进方法，并验证了模型的稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Garrett模型中关于λ（增长符号）的误解，并改进模型的稳健性和实用性。

Method: 通过定义聚合生产函数分布Λ(t)并应用基于能量的Cobb-Douglas方程，修正模型中的问题。

Result: 验证了W曲线的稳定性，但发现E曲线在1970年前存在高估问题。改进后的模型更稳健。

Conclusion: 通过修正关键问题，改进数据和方法，提出了一个更实用和稳健的全球经济热力学模型。

Abstract: In a series of papers, Garrett, et al, presents a thermodynamic economic
model first laid out in "Are there basic physical constraints on future
anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide?". This model contains a key
conceptual issue that obscures a robust system. This system can link to the
Energy Based Cobb-Douglas equation.
  The key conceptual problem is the belief that $\lambda$, the symbol for
growth in Garrett 2011 would disprove the model if it was not constant.
However, $\lambda$ cannot be a constant in an economic model, because
$\lambda$, with dimension [$\frac{E}{\$ \; GWP}$], represents the aggregate
efficiency of all of the more than 359 million firms (and by extension,
households) making products globally. To clarify it, I define this aggregate
production function distribution as $\Lambda(t) \equiv \sum {\lambda_i(t) \cdot
\frac{P_i}{GWP}}$, and with light algebra assign a version of the Energy Based
Cobb-Douglas (EBDC) function to $\lambda$.
  There are various falsified speculations in the body of work that appear to
mostly follow from the original issue. The 50 year stable relation of $W$ to
$E$ is close, but the trend is not flat. The form and degree to which the "long
arm of history" speculation may be true remains to be fully considered, but is
falsified in the form presented. The speculation in Garrett 2022 that
$\frac{dE}{dt}\rightarrow0$ can cause real GDP to go to zero by inflation is
falsified. By generating a dataset going back to -14,000 CE, the speculative
$W$ curve appears largely confirmed. The $E$ curve is quite far off prior to
1970 back to 1 CE due to overestimation of pre-industrial energy.
  By correcting and improving on the foundation issue of Garrett's yeoman
effort, improving $E$ and some equation presentation formalism, a robust
thermodynamic model of the global economy emerges that is straightforward and
practical.

### [204] [Executive Accountability Systems and the Environmental Violations of State-Owned Enterprises in China](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08797)
*Lihua Liu,Yi Chen,Mingli Xu*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究探讨了中国的不规范经营与投资问责制度（ASIOI）对国有企业环境违规行为的抑制作用，发现该政策显著减少了环境违规行为，并通过加强内部控制、增加绿色投资和促进绿色创新实现效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨问责制度如何通过改善国有企业环境表现来推动可持续发展，尤其是在高排放行业。

Method: 利用ASIOI的区域分阶段实施作为准自然实验，结合犯罪学成本效益框架分析。

Result: ASIOI显著减少了国有企业环境违规行为，效果在监管较弱和违规动机较强的企业中更明显。

Conclusion: 问责机制可推动国有企业绿色转型，凸显公共治理在可持续发展中的战略作用。

Abstract: Executive accountability is increasingly viewed as a critical mechanism for
improving corporate environmental performance, especially in state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) that dominate high-emission sectors such as energy,
infrastructure, and heavy industry. This study examines whether China's
Accountability System for Irregular Operations and Investments (ASIOI) curbs
environmental violations in SOEs. Exploiting the staggered regional
implementation of ASIOI as a quasi-natural experiment, we find that the policy
leads to a significant reduction in SOE environmental misconduct. Drawing on a
criminology-based cost-benefit framework, we identify three underlying
mechanisms: strengthened internal controls, increased green investment, and
enhanced green innovation. Further analyses reveal that the deterrent effect of
ASIOI is more pronounced in SOEs that exhibit weaker regulatory oversight and
stronger incentives to commit violations. By focusing on politically embedded
SOEs, this study shows how accountability mechanisms can catalyze proactive
green transformation, enhancing the strategic role of public governance in
sustainability transitions.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文分析了欧盟扩大的两种情景（西巴尔干国家和乌克兰、摩尔多瓦、格鲁吉亚加入），基于Banzhaf和Shapley-Shubik指数评估成员国权力变化，发现两种指数结果不同，且小国在西巴尔干加入时权力增加，但在36国联盟中所有成员国权力均减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究欧盟扩大对成员国权力分配的影响，特别是在不同扩员情景下的权力变化。

Method: 使用Banzhaf和Shapley-Shubik指数评估成员国权力，分析两种扩员情景（西巴尔干国家和乌克兰、摩尔多瓦、格鲁吉亚加入）下的权力分配。

Result: 西巴尔干加入时小国权力增加（新成员悖论），但在36国联盟中所有成员国权力均减少；某些联盟在EU36情景下表现更好。

Conclusion: 欧盟扩员对成员国权力分配有显著影响，不同扩员情景下权力变化不同，需综合考虑扩员策略。

Abstract: As of 2022, the European Union has taken several steps regarding enlargement.
We focus on the accession of countries with which the Union is actively
negotiating membership. This is examined under two enlargement scenarios:
first, the enlargement along the lines of the Western Balkan countries, and
second, the accession of a trio (Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia) to the already
enlarged Union. We determine the a priori power of the member states based on
the Banzhaf and Shapley--Shubik indices. Various coalitions are also assumed to
assess the power and influence of member states, considering both pre- and
post-enlargement scenarios. We found a rare case when the two indices give
different rankings. In the case of the Western Balkan countries' accession, the
smaller population member states gain power, presenting an example of the new
member paradox. While in a Union of 36 members, every member state loses some
of their current power. However, some coalitions are better off with the EU36
enlargement than a EU33 one.

*Alberto Baccini,Lucio Barabesi,Carlo Debernardi*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文通过多层网络方法分析2006至2020年EconLit索引期刊，探讨全球金融危机对经济学学科结构的影响，发现尽管研究主题变化，期刊间的社会和知识关系保持稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究全球金融危机后经济学学科结构的变化，探索期刊间社会和知识关系是否因危机而改变。

Method: 采用多层网络方法，结合共享编辑和作者的社交关系，以及文献耦合和文本相似性的知识关系，通过相似性网络融合生成统一网络并识别期刊社区。

Result: 比较2006、2012和2019年的数据显示，尽管研究主题变化，期刊间的社会和知识关系保持高度稳定。

Conclusion: 编辑网络持续塑造学科层级并合法化知识生产，表明金融危机未显著改变经济学学科的基本结构。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the global financial crisis on the
shape of economics as a discipline by analyzing EconLit-indexed journals from
2006 to 2020 using a multilayer network approach. We consider two types of
social relationships among journals, based on shared editors (interlocking
editorship) and shared authors (interlocking authorship), as well as two forms
of intellectual proximity, derived from bibliographic coupling and textual
similarity. These four dimensions are integrated using Similarity Network
Fusion to produce a unified similarity network from which journal communities
are identified. Comparing the field in 2006, 2012, and 2019 reveals a high
degree of structural continuity. Our findings suggest that, despite changes in
research topics after the crisis, fundamental social and intellectual
relationships among journals have remained remarkably stable. Editorial
networks, in particular, continue to shape hierarchies and legitimize knowledge
production.

### [207] [Bailouts by Representation: A Minimal TLC Theory with Weighted Consent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08693)
*Xinli Guo*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于加权代表民主（WRD）的理论机制，通过政治影子成本和加权同意上限来约束省级救助，仅在外部性阈值达到时考虑救助。静态问题得出简单的“阈值-线性-上限”（TLC）政策，并分析了完全无救助制度的临界条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过政治和制度设计约束省级救助，避免滥用并确保救助仅在必要时发生。

Method: 采用加权代表民主（WRD）机制，结合政治影子成本和加权同意上限，推导出TLC政策，并通过比较静态分析验证其效果。

Result: TLC政策在静态问题中表现为阈值以下无救助、中间线性救助和上限平坦救助。研究发现完全无救助制度的临界条件，并展示了制度变化的透明比较静态效应。

Conclusion: WRD机制与筛选模型得出的TLC规则在观测上等效，但其几何特性源于代表设计而非私人信息。提出了一种约束双节点样条方法，支持事后合规检查。

Abstract: We develop a purely theoretical mechanism in which provincial bailouts are
disciplined by two levers derived from Weighted Representative Democracy (WRD):
a political shadow cost of public funds and a weighted-consent cap on any
transfer. Bailouts are considered only when an externality threshold is met.
With quadratic implementation costs, the static problem yields a simple
''threshold--linear--cap'' (TLC) policy: zero below a lower activation point,
linear in the middle, and flat at an upper cap. We characterize a knife-edge
for a complete no bailout regime, either because the consent cap blocks all
proposals or because the political cost of funds exceeds the maximum marginal
benefit of relief. Comparative statics are transparent: increasing the
political cost shifts activation upward; tightening the consent cap lowers the
upper plateau; joint institutional changes move the two kinks in predictable
ways. The WRD mechanism is observation ally equivalent to TLC rules obtained
from screening models, yet attributes the same geometry to representation
design rather than private information. For implementation and audit, we
propose a constrained two-knot spline that recovers three interpretable metrics
from data, activation threshold, interior slope, and the cap level, which
support routine ex-post compliance checks.

### [208] [Existence of Richter-Peleg Representation for General Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08980)
*Leandro Gorno,Paulo Klinger Monteiro*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 该论文研究了无需完全性或传递性的偏好关系，提出了Richter-Peleg表示的一般条件，即强无环性和传递闭包的可分性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在偏好关系不完全或不传递的情况下，如何通过Richter-Peleg表示来简化决策理论中的标量最大化问题。

Method: 通过分析二元关系的强无环性和传递闭包的可分性，建立Richter-Peleg表示的必要和充分条件。

Result: 主要结果是：二元关系具有Richter-Peleg表示当且仅当它是强无环且传递闭包可分。此外，在可数集合上，强无环性足以保证表示；预序关系可分时也成立。

Conclusion: 研究结果为决策理论提供了新工具，特别是在存在不确定性时通过标量最大化获取最大元素。

Abstract: This paper provides a general characterization of preferences that admit a
Richter-Peleg representation without imposing completeness or transitivity. We
establish that a binary relation on a nonempty set admits a Richter-Peleg
representation if and only if it is "strongly acyclic" and its transitive
closure is "separable". Strong acyclicity rules out problematic cycles among
indifference classes, while separability limits the structural complexity of
the relation. Our main result has two significant corollaries. First, when the
set of alternatives is countable, a binary relation admits a Richter-Peleg
representation if and only if it is strongly acyclic. Second, a preorder admits
a Richter-Peleg representation if and only if it is separable. These findings
have important implications for decision theory, particularly for obtaining
maximal elements through scalar maximization in the presence of indecisiveness.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在代理人权益为无理数时，分配蛋糕需要无限次查询的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在代理人权益为无理数时，如何公平分配资源，同时考虑查询次数的限制。

Method: 通过查询代理人进行切割和评估，学习其偏好以分配蛋糕。

Result: 证明若权益为无理数，则需无限次查询才能实现公平分配。

Conclusion: 无理数权益导致分配协议复杂度显著增加。

Abstract: A perfectly divisible cake is to be divided among a group of agents. Each
agent is entitled to a share between zero and one, and these entitlements are
compatible in that they sum to one. The mediator does not know the preferences
of the agents, but can query the agents to make cuts and appraise slices in
order to learn. We prove that if one of the entitlements is irrational, then
the mediator must use a protocol that involves an arbitrarily large number of
queries in order to construct an allocation that respects the entitlements
regardless of preferences.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何将排名和效用之间的转换问题扩展到所有p-范数，并证明任何一对排名可以在任意范数下嵌入到二维空间中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多应用中，如投票行为分析或产品推荐，需要将排名（序数）与效用（数值）之间进行转换。现有方法在特定范数下已证明可行，但需要扩展到更广泛的范数。

Method: 通过将排名和效用表示为共享度量空间中的关系，研究在所有p-范数下的嵌入可能性，并证明二维空间的普适性。

Result: 证明任何偏好配置文件可以在所有p-范数下嵌入到d维欧几里得空间（d≥min{n,m−1}），且任何一对排名可在任意范数下嵌入到二维空间。

Conclusion: 研究显著扩展了空间偏好模型的适用范围，为更广泛的实际应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Whether the goal is to analyze voting behavior, locate facilities, or
recommend products, the problem of translating between (ordinal) rankings and
(numerical) utilities arises naturally in many contexts. This task is commonly
approached by representing both the individuals doing the ranking (voters) and
the items to be ranked (alternatives) in a shared metric space, where ordinal
preferences are translated into relationships between pairwise distances. Prior
work has established that any collection of rankings with $n$ voters and $m$
alternatives (preference profile) can be embedded into $d$-dimensional
Euclidean space for $d \geq \min\{n,m-1\}$ under the Euclidean norm and the
Manhattan norm. We show that this holds for all $p$-norms and establish that
any pair of rankings can be embedded into $R^2$ under arbitrary norms,
significantly expanding the reach of spatial preference models.

TL;DR: SharpXR是一种结构感知的双解码器U-Net，用于在低剂量儿科X射线中去噪并保留诊断相关特征，显著提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源匮乏地区，低剂量儿科X射线因噪声问题影响诊断准确性，传统去噪方法会损失关键细节。

Method: SharpXR结合拉普拉斯引导的边缘保留解码器和可学习融合模块，模拟Poisson-Gaussian噪声进行训练。

Result: SharpXR在所有评估指标上优于现有方法，肺炎分类准确率从88.8%提升至92.5%。

Conclusion: SharpXR在低资源儿科护理中具有显著诊断价值，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.

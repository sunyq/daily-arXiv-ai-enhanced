Particularly, we establish two network slices to provide sensing and\ncommunication services, respectively. In the large-timescale planning for the\nslices, we partition the sensing region of interest (RoI) of each mobile device\nand reserve network resources accordingly, facilitating low-complexity\ndistance-based sensing target assignment in small timescales. To cope with the\nnon-stationary spatial distributions of mobile devices and sensing targets,\nwhich can result in the drift in modeling the distributions and ineffective\nplanning decisions, we construct digital twins (DTs) of the slices. In each DT,\na drift-adaptive statistical model and an emulation function are developed for\nthe spatial distributions in the corresponding slice, which facilitates\nclosed-form decision-making and efficient validation of a planning decision,\nrespectively.

However, existing MIL methods often\nfail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both\nglobally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally\nthrough -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a\nprincipled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal\ndistribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel\nMIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv\nformulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two\nconstraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological\ndistributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by\nregulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware\nconstraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by\nprogressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT\nproblem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that\ncan be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.\nEmpirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular\nbenchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In\naddition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers\nhigh interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in\ndigital pathology.

The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and\nRepresentation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address\nthese challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this\nmethodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j\ndatabases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate\ndata from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches\noften require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not\nbe familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to\nbridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes\nPython and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our\nnovel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)\ndatabase.

Speculative decoding leverages idle GPU compute by using\na lightweight drafter to propose K tokens, which the LLM verifies in parallel,\nboosting token throughput. In conventional dense LLMs, all model weights are\nfetched each iteration, so speculation adds no latency overhead. Emerging\nMixture of Experts (MoE) models activate only a subset of weights per token,\ngreatly reducing data movement. However, we show that speculation is\nineffective for MoEs: draft tokens collectively activate more weights,\nincreasing data movement and verification time by 2-3x. When token throughput\ngains fail to offset this overhead, speculation causes slowdowns up to 1.5x,\nmaking it infeasible. Even when useful, the optimal K varies by task, model,\nand even between requests and iterations. Thus, despite widespread use in dense\nLLMs, speculation remains impractical in leading MoEs.\n  We present Cascade, a utility-driven framework that selectively enables\nspeculation to avoid slowdowns and dynamically tunes K to accelerate MoE\nserving. Cascade uses a lightweight metric, speculation utility, the ratio of\ntoken gains to verification cost, which shows iteration-level locality,\nenabling periodic decisions via short test and longer set phases. For each\nrequest, Cascade disables speculation if utility drops below one during\ntesting, and when utility exceeds one, tests multiple K-values to choose the\nutility-maximizing K for the set phase. We implement Cascade in vLLM and\nevaluate it on five popular MoEs with workloads spanning code, math,\nextraction, and mixed tasks. Cascade limits slowdown to 5% (vs. 1.5x) and\nimproves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding\npractical for MoEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPU\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u662f\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8349\u6848\u5668\u63d0\u51faK\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\uff0cLLM\u5e76\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4ee4\u724c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u51cf\u901f\u3002Cascade\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574K\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u542f\u7528\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4f18\u5316MoE\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u51cf\u901f\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCascade\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u6d4b\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u542f\u7528\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5e76\u8c03\u6574K\u503c\u3002", "result": "Cascade\u5c06\u51cf\u901f\u9650\u5236\u57285%\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53477-14%\uff0c\u4f7f\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5728MoE\u4e2d\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "Cascade\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

A key challenge arises from the latent nature of broader economy-wide\nrisk sources: macro-financial proxies are unavailable at high-frequencies,\nwhile the abundance of low-frequency candidates offers limited guidance on\nempirical relevance. To address this, we develop a two-stage\n``divide-and-conquer'' approach. The first stage estimates exposures to\nhigh-frequency idiosyncratic and market risk only, using asset-level IV\nregressions. The second stage identifies latent economy-wide factors by\nextracting the leading principal component from the model residuals and mapping\nit to lower-frequency macro-financial uncertainty and sentiment-based\nindicators via high-dimensional variable selection. Structured patterns of\nheterogeneity in exposures are uncovered using Mean Group estimators across\nasset categories. The method is applied to a broad sample of crypto assets,\ncovering more than 80% of total market capitalization. We document short-term\nmean reversion and significant average exposures to idiosyncratic volatility\nand illiquidity. Green and DeFi assets are, on average, more exposed to\nmarket-level and economy-wide risk than their non-Green and non-DeFi\ncounterparts. By contrast, stablecoins are less exposed to idiosyncratic,\nmarket-level, and economy-wide risk factors relative to non-stablecoins.

The increasing\nhardware diversity in HPC systems often necessitates the development of\narchitecture-specific code, hindering the sustainability of large-scale\nscientific applications. In this work, we leverage DaCe, a data-centric\nparallel programming framework, to automate the generation of high-performance\nkernels. DaCe enables automatic code generation for multicore processors and\nvarious accelerators, reducing the burden on developers who would otherwise\nneed to rewrite code for each new architecture. Our study demonstrates DaCe's\ncapabilities by applying its automatic code generation to a critical\ncomputational kernel used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Specifically,\nwe focus on Neko, a Fortran-based solver that employs the spectral-element\nmethod, which relies on small tensor operations. We detail the formulation of\nthis computational kernel using DaCe's Stateful Dataflow Multigraph (SDFG)\nrepresentation and discuss how this approach facilitates high-performance code\ngeneration. Additionally, we outline the workflow for seamlessly integrating\nDaCe's generated code into the Neko solver. Our results highlight the\nportability and performance of the generated code across multiple platforms,\nincluding Nvidia GH200, Nvidia A100, and AMD MI250X GPUs, with competitive\nperformance results.

While versatile LLMs appear to\nhave demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and\nproviding responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether\nthey perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans.

Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing\nshallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal\nknowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine\nhuman-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,\nmethodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of\ntransformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.\nEmpirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,\nwhose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs\nexhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier\nbenchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal\nreasoning.

Interest in adopting\nthese systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes\nnature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and\ndiverse medical literature.

On one hand, regressive\nSR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single\nsolution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity\nin information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On\nthe other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but\nselecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge.

These\nlimitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world\nlanguage tasks.\n  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream\napplications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant\nknowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training\ntechnique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,\nwe present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces\nmemory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also\nintroduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better\nfollow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their\nperformance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.\nFinally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop\nspatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more\ncomprehensively.\n  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results\ndemonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,\nefficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of\napplications.

This paper\ndescribes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the\neffects of conditioning on new information.

Subsequent gradient\ndescent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model\nperformance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and\nanswering questions about text passages after a single gradient update.

Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor\ndeveloper experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture\nwas adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and\ntechnologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro\nFrontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's\nneeds. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other\nalternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable\nresults.

There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe\nthat changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related\ntraits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize\nmulti-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in\nisolation.

This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that\nauthentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering\nadvancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce\nMT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational\nstance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset\navailable for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and\nexhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges\nfor stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large\nLanguage model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),\nwhich exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational\nunderstanding.

Diffusion models offer a\npromising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;\nhowever, their application to text generation is hindered by the high\ndimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel\napproach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth\nlatent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using\nan autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and\nalignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing\nrobust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based\naugmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be\ncompressed by $8\\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to\ntoken-level diffusion models.

To alleviate this\nproblem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method\ntailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention\nmodification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow\ntransformation.

However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way.

However, inherent photometric distortions\nin the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without\naccounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently\nincorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the\nquality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D\nscene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By\nintroducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full\nphotometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on\nsimultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the\nproposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D\nscene representation.

We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as\nRoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy\ncomparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in\ngroundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.\nThe code is available at : https://github.com/chandarlab/Hallucinate-less", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u67e5\u8be2\u662f\u5426\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11LLMs\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u65f6\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u67e5\u8be2\u662f\u5426\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982RoBERTa\u548cNomicBERT\uff09\u5728\u7cbe\u9009\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684groundedness\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5728groundedness\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLMs\uff08\u5982Llama3 8B\u548cGPT4o\uff09\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684groundedness\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11LLMs\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the\nfailure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due\nto the underlying LM not representing this concept.

This approach eliminates the\nneed for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.\nThe resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,\ncomputational efficiency, and interpretability.

Our experiments demonstrate that\nthe sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering\nthrough targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of\nneuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers.

After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,\nnon-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18\nbackbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary\nmasks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach\nachieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with\na 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing\ninference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that\nFFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative\nmargin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and\nimprove surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment.

Yet, a score fails to\ndescribe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.\nBenefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models\n(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.\nThe core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.\nPrevious explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data\ngeneration processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary\nsystems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.\nSpecifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled\nvideo and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a\nhierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific\ndimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning\nprocess. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written\nquality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and\ngeneration efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset\ncontains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for\ninstruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and\njustification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy\nto fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a\nbenchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the\nquality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the\nS2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently\nimproves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video\nLMMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\uff08SIG\uff09\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08VQA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfVQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u751f\u6210\u6570\u503c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63cf\u8ff0\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u9002\u914d\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSIG\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u5e76\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684Score2Instruct\uff08S2I\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc732\u4e07\u6761\u6307\u4ee4-\u54cd\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u8c03\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891LMMs\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "SIG\u7ba1\u9053\u548cS2I\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891LMMs\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

On the other\nhand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,\nas a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local\nmodel. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a\nconvergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial\ncomponents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFedSC\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u534f\u4f5c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5173\u7cfb\u539f\u578b\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u539f\u578b\u6355\u83b7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff08\u5982\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u597d\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "FedSC\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5173\u7cfb\u539f\u578b\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eFedSC\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "FedSC\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u534f\u4f5c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Recent research\nhas been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by\nselecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data.

To\ncomplement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance\nby optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively\nunderexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering\ndata efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training\ndata organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a\nnovel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model\nforgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the\ndata efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,\nvarious instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying\ndegrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these\ninstances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for\ndata ordering achieves the most significant improvement.

In recent studies,\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the\nchallenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain\nlargely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing\nmultimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and\nshortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model\nmisinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut\nproblem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,\ndirectly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.\nTo tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with\na clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This\nglobal context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking\nkey multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the\naccurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a\ncontext reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy\nrewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the\nLLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process\nsuccessfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also\nintroduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating\nmodels in understanding complex human intentions and emotions.

Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to\ndomain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with\nlarge inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of\ndiffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting\nintermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature\ncollection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing\nperformance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an\nobject-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class\nprompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.\nWe also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,\nbalancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving\nperformance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a\nunified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through\nfeature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and\nunlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection\nperformance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on\n3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks.

These models operate in a bitwise\nautoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically\ninfinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a\ngrowing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are\nlikely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same\nmodels. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where\nrepeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own\nprevious versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising\nmitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet\ndetectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of\ngenerated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise\nwatermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at\nthe bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as\nresolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark\nsubtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed\nwhile remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques.

To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly\nintegrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model\ntraining to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,\nwe train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,\nperception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures\nthe rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained\ndiffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D\nGaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception\npriors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth\nconsistency.

Typically, training data is generated\nusing point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D\nsensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits\nthe generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,\ndomain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological\ninformation, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the\nsource domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware\nModeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds.

In addition to requiring camera\nparameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive\ntest-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a\nunified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for\ntest-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view\npanoptic segmentation in a single forward pass.

While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving\nprototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to\nsystematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype\nrepresentativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and\nefficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD.

The characteristic transfer is\nachieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while\nthe anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike\nconventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting\nmakes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal\ntransport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the\ngap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.\nFor comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive\nprototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.\nExtensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and\nRealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our\napproach under 1/2/4-shots.", "AI": {"tldr": "FastRef\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u539f\u578b\u7cbe\u70bc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08FS-IAD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u6291\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u539f\u578b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u9650\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u56fe\u50cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "FastRef\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u539f\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6291\u5236\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86FastRef\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e1/2/4-shot\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "FastRef\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u56fe\u50cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Contrasting with existing two-stage\nmethods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and\nparametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D\nparametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation\ncaused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,\nparametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view\noptimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their\ngeometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a\nnovel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and\nedge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a\ncurve-aware Gaussian representation, \\textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables\ndifferentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by\nmulti-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology\noptimization framework during training to refine curve structures through\nlinearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive\nevaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our\none-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in\nproducing cleaner and more robust reconstructions.

Yet, the identification and\ncharacterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.\nIn this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network\npredicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image\nand annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector\ncollection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly\nlearned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,\nHyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density\nareas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment\norgans in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two\n3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the\nAMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real\nunknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a\nstructured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant\nsystematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet\nparameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying\nlearned systematic bias.

However, their\nidentification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle\nmorphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among\npathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis\ndataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive\nbenchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic\nfigure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with\nlinear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation\n(LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF\ndatasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer\ncohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++\ntraining set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135,\n0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and\nAtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for\nLoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models.

In addition,\nfour intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing\nconfiguration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of\ntotal vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic\nflow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that\nswitches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak\ntraffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic\ngenerator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and\na signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,\ndynamic, and hybrid methods.

Existing\ntraining-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the\nuse of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during\ngeneration, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,\nand degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome\nthese challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a\nnovel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text\ngeneration with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC\nstep-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image\nand the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of\ncandidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual\nbaseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually\ngrounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time\ncontext alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring\nthe overall quality of the textual output.

We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the\nrepresentations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among\nembeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.\nOur method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k\nwithout relying on external data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u5339\u914d\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u96c6\u5408\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u7a00\u758f\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u96c6\u5408\u584c\u9677\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMaximal Pair Assignment Similarity\u4f18\u5316\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Global Discriminative Loss\u548cIntra-Set Divergence Loss\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728MS-COCO\u548cFlickr30k\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u96c6\u5408\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While recent diffusion-based view\nsynthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,\nthey generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object\nare occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction\nquality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for\nocclusion-aware multi-view generation.

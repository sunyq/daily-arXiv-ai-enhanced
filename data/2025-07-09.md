### [1] [Strongly Solving $7 \times 6$ Connect-Four on Consumer Grade Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05267)
*Markus Böck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过基于二元决策图的符号搜索方法，成功生成了一个89.6 GB的查找表，解决了标准7×6棋盘大小的Connect-Four游戏的强解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Connect-Four游戏已被数学解决，但基于查找表的强解被认为不可行。本文旨在重新探讨符号搜索方法以实现这一目标。

Method: 采用基于二元决策图的符号搜索方法，高效生成了一个大型查找表，并结合alpha-beta搜索以优化最快获胜或最慢失败的策略。

Result: 在单核CPU和128 GB内存的条件下，47小时内生成了89.6 GB的查找表，实现了强解。

Conclusion: 本文证明了符号搜索方法在生成Connect-Four游戏强解中的可行性，并通过开源工具提供了进一步优化的策略。

Abstract: While the game Connect-Four has been solved mathematically and the best move
can be effectively computed with search based methods, a strong solution in the
form of a look-up table was believed to be infeasible. In this paper, we
revisit a symbolic search method based on binary decision diagrams to produce
strong solutions. With our efficient implementation we were able to produce a
89.6 GB large look-up table in 47 hours on a single CPU core with 128 GB main
memory for the standard $7 \times 6$ board size. In addition to this
win-draw-loss evaluation, we include an alpha-beta search in our open source
artifact to find the move which achieves the fastest win or slowest loss.

### [2] [Current Practices for Building LLM-Powered Reasoning Tools Are Ad Hoc -- and We Can Do Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05886)
*Aaron Bembenek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为神经符号转换系统的计算模型，用于构建神经符号自动推理工具，结合符号算法和大型语言模型，以提升推理能力并保持符号算法的强保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前构建神经符号自动推理系统的方法缺乏传统符号算法的强保证，且未能充分利用神经网络与符号推理的协同潜力。

Method: 提出神经符号转换系统，将符号状态与直觉配对，并在符号和直觉上并行执行状态转换。

Result: 该模型有望扩展逻辑推理能力，同时保留符号算法的强保证。

Conclusion: 神经符号转换系统为构建神经符号自动推理工具提供了理论基础，并可通过逻辑编程语言实现。

Abstract: There is growing excitement about building software verifiers, synthesizers,
and other Automated Reasoning (AR) tools by combining traditional symbolic
algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, the current
practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc
programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional
symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I
propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model
that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this
model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate
over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale
logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong
guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model
I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.

### [3] [Chat2SPaT: A Large Language Model Based Tool for Automating Traffic Signal Control Plan Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05283)
*Yue Wang,Miao Zhou,Guijing Huang,Rui Zhuo,Chao Yi,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chat2SPaT利用大型语言模型（LLMs）将用户半结构化的交通信号控制计划描述转换为精确的信号相位与时间（SPaT）结果，简化了信号控制计划的管理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的定时交通信号控制需要繁琐的手动操作，尤其是在多计划管理时。Chat2SPaT旨在通过LLMs实现用户友好的计划管理。

Method: 通过LLMs理解用户描述并生成JSON格式的相位序列和属性，再通过Python脚本处理细节，最终生成完整的信号控制计划。

Result: 实验表明，Chat2SPaT在英文和中文测试数据集上生成计划的准确率超过94%。

Conclusion: Chat2SPaT为交通从业者和研究人员提供了易于使用的计划管理工具，展示了LLMs在智能交通系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized
intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for
signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans
are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading
to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a
user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study
proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous
descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)
results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or
ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)
software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first
leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan
descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and
phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python
scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic
signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.
Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan
editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of
over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300
plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of
understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an
easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,
serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile
application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test
dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模糊分类聚合函数的性质，特别是在多对象和多类型分类中的最优解。

Method: 通过数学证明，分析满足最优、独立和零一致条件的模糊分类聚合函数。

Result: 发现唯一满足条件的函数是加权算术平均。

Conclusion: 加权算术平均是连续个体分类聚合的唯一有效方法。

Abstract: We prove that any optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy
classification aggregation function of a continuum of individual
classifications of $m\ge 3$ objects into $2\le p\le m$ types must be a weighted
arithmetic mean.

### [5] [OLG++: A Semantic Extension of Obligation Logic Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05488)
*Subhasis Dasgupta,Jon Stephens,Amarnath Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OLG++是Obligation Logic Graph（OLG）的语义扩展，用于建模市政和跨辖区的法规和法律规则。它引入了更丰富的节点和边类型，支持复杂的法律义务、例外和层次结构表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如LegalRuleML）在表达法律规则的复杂性和上下文条件时存在不足，OLG++旨在提供更丰富的语义支持。

Method: OLG++扩展了OLG，引入空间、时间、群体、可废止性和逻辑分组等构造，支持结构化推理。

Result: 通过食品业务法规的示例，OLG++展示了其在法律问答中的表达能力，并优于现有图模型。

Conclusion: OLG++在表达法律知识方面比现有图模型更具表现力，尤其在支持子类、空间约束和例外结构方面。

Abstract: We present OLG++, a semantic extension of the Obligation Logic Graph (OLG)
for modeling regulatory and legal rules in municipal and interjurisdictional
contexts. OLG++ introduces richer node and edge types, including spatial,
temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs, enabling
nuanced representations of legal obligations, exceptions, and hierarchies. The
model supports structured reasoning over rules with contextual conditions,
precedence, and complex triggers. We demonstrate its expressiveness through
examples from food business regulations, showing how OLG++ supports legal
question answering using property graph queries. OLG++ also improves over
LegalRuleML by providing native support for subClassOf, spatial constraints,
and reified exception structures. Our examples show that OLG++ is more
expressive than prior graph-based models for legal knowledge representation.

### [6] [Deep Research Comparator: A Platform For Fine-grained Human Annotations of Deep Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05495)
*Prahaladh Chandrahasan,Jiahe Jin,Zhihan Zhang,Tevin Wang,Andy Tang,Lucy Mo,Morteza Ziyadi,Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro,Zimeng Qiu,Markus Dreyer,Akari Asai,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Deep Research Comparator平台，用于评估深度研究代理的生成报告，支持对比、反馈和排名功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决评估深度研究代理生成的长报告和中间步骤反馈的挑战。

Method: 开发了Deep Research Comparator平台，支持代理报告对比、中间步骤评估和反馈收集；并提出了Simple Deepresearch作为基线代理。

Result: 收集了17位标注者对三个深度研究代理的真实偏好数据，验证了平台的有效性。

Conclusion: 平台为深度研究代理的开发提供了实用工具，支持详细评估和反馈。

Abstract: Effectively evaluating deep research agents that autonomously search the web,
analyze information, and generate reports remains a major challenge,
particularly when it comes to assessing long reports and giving detailed
feedback on their intermediate steps. To address these gaps, we introduce Deep
Research Comparator, a platform that offers a holistic framework for deep
research agent hosting, side-by-side comparison, fine-grained human feedback
collection, and ranking calculation. Given a user query, our platform displays
the final reports from two different agents along with their intermediate steps
during generation. Annotators can evaluate the overall quality of final reports
based on side-by-side comparison, and also provide detailed feedback separately
by assessing intermediate steps or specific text spans within the final report.
Furthermore, we develop Simple Deepresearch, an end-to-end agent scaffold. This
scaffold serves as a baseline that facilitates the easy integration of various
large language models to transform them into deep research agents for
evaluation. To demonstrate the platform's utility for deep research agent
development, we have collected real user preference data from 17 annotators on
three deep research agents. A demo video of our platform can be found at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4d2dnbdseg.

### [7] [Fine-Grained Vision-Language Modeling for Multimodal Training Assistants in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05515)
*Haochen Huang,Jiahuan Pei,Mohammad Aliannejadi,Xin Sun,Moonisa Ahsan,Pablo Cesar,Chuang Yu,Zhaochun Ren,Junxiao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在增强现实（AR）训练中的应用，发现即使是先进模型如GPT-4o在细粒度任务上表现不佳，呼吁改进数据集和基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在AR训练中的潜力，填补研究空白，并为盲人和视障用户提供平等的AI学习机会。

Method: 构建了一个针对AR训练的综合性数据集，并评估了九种先进的VLMs。

Result: 先进模型在细粒度任务（如状态检测）上表现有限，最高F1分数仅为40.54%。

Conclusion: 需改进数据集和基准以提升细粒度视觉语言对齐，研究具有广泛社会意义。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart
assistants to interpret and reason in multimodal environments. However, their
application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training,
featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine
state-of-the-art VLMs on it. Our results reveal that even advanced models,
including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a
maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight
the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve
fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our
work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and
visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning
opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source
code, and evaluation results, to support the research community.

*Gopal Gupta,Abhiramon Rajasekharan,Alexis R. Tudor,Elmer Salazar,Joaquín Arias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种使用答案集编程（ASP）中的默认否定和强否定来优雅地表达义务模态逻辑的方法，并通过ASP的全局约束解决了其悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决义务模态逻辑的实现问题，尤其是其悖论。

Method: 利用ASP中的默认否定和强否定表达模态算子，并使用ASP的全局约束表示义务和禁止。

Result: 提出的方法优雅地解决了义务模态逻辑的各种悖论。

Conclusion: ASP为义务模态逻辑的实现提供了一种有效且优雅的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of implementing deontic modal logic. We show how
(deontic) modal operators can be expressed elegantly using default negation
(negation-as-failure) and strong negation present in answer set programming
(ASP). We propose using global constraints of ASP to represent obligations and
impermissibilities of deontic modal logic. We show that our proposed
representation results in the various paradoxes of deontic modal logic being
elegantly resolved.

### [9] [Cultivating Multimodal Intelligence: Interpretive Reasoning and Agentic RAG Approaches to Dermatological Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05520)
*Karishma Thakrar,Shreyas Basavatia,Akshay Daftardar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC挑战赛聚焦多模态皮肤病问答与分割，提出结合微调多模态模型、结构化推理层和检索增强生成的方法，在竞赛中取得优异成绩，并解决远程医疗中的诊断挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决远程医疗中基于有限输入的异步诊断需求，提高诊断准确性和可解释性。

Method: 结合微调开源多模态模型（Qwen、Gemma、LLaMA）、结构化推理层和检索增强生成（agentic RAG）。

Result: 竞赛中排名第二，提交作品排名第六，表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法模拟皮肤科医生的系统推理模式，为自动化诊断支持系统提供了可靠路径。

Abstract: The second edition of the 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge, co-organized
by researchers from Microsoft, Stanford University, and the Hospital Clinic of
Barcelona, focuses on multimodal dermatology question answering and
segmentation, using real-world patient queries and images. This work addresses
the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select
the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both
user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed
approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal
models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2)
introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates
between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic
retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information
from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to
fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a
submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high
accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical
challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made
asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability.
By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when
evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more
reliable automated diagnostic support systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作缺乏可扩展性，未能利用多样化的课程内容，且缺乏评估教学质量的框架。

Result: 在多样化设置中验证了工作流的有效性，展示了LLM跨领域的能力。

Conclusion: WikiHowAgent为教学对话和评估提供了可扩展的解决方案，并开源资源促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced virtual educators and learners,
bridging NLP with AI4Education. Existing work often lacks scalability and fails
to leverage diverse, large-scale course content, with limited frameworks for
assessing pedagogic quality. To this end, we propose WikiHowAgent, a
multi-agent workflow leveraging LLMs to simulate interactive teaching-learning
conversations. It integrates teacher and learner agents, an interaction
manager, and an evaluator to facilitate procedural learning and assess
pedagogic quality. We introduce a dataset of 114,296 teacher-learner
conversations grounded in 14,287 tutorials across 17 domains and 727 topics.
Our evaluation protocol combines computational and rubric-based metrics with
human judgment alignment. Results demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness in
diverse setups, offering insights into LLM capabilities across domains. Our
datasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.

### [11] [Red Teaming AI Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05538)
*Subhabrata Majumdar,Brian Pendleton,Abhishek Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文批判性地审视了AI红队测试的实践，指出其当前过于关注模型级漏洞而忽视更广泛的社会技术系统。作者提出了一个包含宏观和微观层面的综合框架，并建议多学科团队以应对系统性风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI红队测试在AI治理中流行，但其当前实践与初衷存在差距，未能全面考虑社会技术系统和涌现行为。

Method: 提出一个两层次框架：宏观系统红队测试和微观模型红队测试，结合网络安全经验和系统理论。

Result: 建议多学科团队以检查涌现风险、系统性漏洞及技术与社会因素的相互作用。

Conclusion: 有效的AI红队测试需超越模型级漏洞，关注更广泛的系统性问题。

Abstract: Red teaming has evolved from its origins in military applications to become a
widely adopted methodology in cybersecurity and AI. In this paper, we take a
critical look at the practice of AI red teaming. We argue that despite its
current popularity in AI governance, there exists a significant gap between red
teaming's original intent as a critical thinking exercise and its narrow focus
on discovering model-level flaws in the context of generative AI. Current AI
red teaming efforts focus predominantly on individual model vulnerabilities
while overlooking the broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors
that arise from complex interactions between models, users, and environments.
To address this deficiency, we propose a comprehensive framework
operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system
red teaming spanning the entire AI development lifecycle, and micro-level model
red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity experience and systems theory, we further
propose a set of recommendations. In these, we emphasize that effective AI red
teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic
vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.

*Shovito Barua Soumma,Asiful Arefeen,Stephanie M. Carpenter,Melanie Hingle,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用GPT-4o-mini生成反事实解释（CFs）的零样本和三样本方法，在压力预测和心脏病检测任务中表现优于传统方法，并提升了下游分类器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实解释（CFs）能提供人类可理解的机器学习预测解释，可用于异常预防和增强模型鲁棒性。本文探索了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成CFs中的应用。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini在零样本和三样本设置下生成CFs，并在AI-Readi压力预测数据集和公共心脏病检测数据集上评估。

Result: 相比传统方法（如DiCE、CFNOW、NICE），LLM生成的CFs具有高合理性（99%）、强有效性（0.99）和竞争性稀疏性。此外，CFs作为增强数据提升了分类器性能（平均准确率提高5%）。

Conclusion: 基于提示的生成技术能显著提升临床和生理预测任务的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer human-centric insights into machine
learning predictions by highlighting minimal changes required to alter an
outcome. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality
prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. In this work, we
explore large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini, for generating
CFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting. We evaluate our approach on two
datasets: the AI-Readi flagship dataset for stress prediction and a public
dataset for heart disease detection. Compared to traditional methods such as
DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, our few-shot LLM-based approach achieves high
plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive
sparsity. Moreover, using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves
downstream classifier performance (an average accuracy gain of 5%), especially
in low-data regimes. This demonstrates the potential of prompt-based generative
techniques to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and
physiological prediction tasks. Code base: github.com/anonymous/SenseCF.

*David Bensaïd,Noam Rotstein,Roy Velich,Daniel Bensaïd,Ron Kimmel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SingLoRA通过将低秩适应重新表述为单个低秩矩阵与其转置的分解，解决了LoRA中的尺度冲突问题，提升了训练稳定性并减少了参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在参数高效微调中表现出色，但矩阵间的尺度差异导致训练不稳定和性能下降。

Method: 提出SingLoRA，将权重更新分解为单个低秩矩阵与其转置的乘积，消除尺度冲突并减少参数。

Result: 在多个任务中验证了SingLoRA的优势，如在LLama 7B微调中准确率超过LoRA和LoRA+，且参数更少。

Conclusion: SingLoRA通过简单设计解决了LoRA的问题，显著提升了性能与效率。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights
of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a
low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities
between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates
low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a
single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design
inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,
and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the
infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable
feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks
validate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on
MNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+
(90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation,
fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image
fidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to
scores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.

Conclusion: 标准化AI测量有助于统一研究与实践，并为未来的AI评估和监管奠定基础。

Abstract: We motivate and outline a programme for a formal theory of measurement of
artificial intelligence. We argue that formalising measurement for AI will
allow researchers, practitioners, and regulators to: (i) make comparisons
between systems and the evaluation methods applied to them; (ii) connect
frontier AI evaluations with established quantitative risk analysis techniques
drawn from engineering and safety science; and (iii) foreground how what counts
as AI capability is contingent upon the measurement operations and scales we
elect to use. We sketch a layered measurement stack, distinguish direct from
indirect observables, and signpost how these ingredients provide a pathway
toward a unified, calibratable taxonomy of AI phenomena.

Result: 在CMDC和E-DAIC-WOZ数据集上取得最优结果。

Conclusion: MLlm-DR实现了高效、可解释的抑郁症诊断，具有临床实用潜力。

Abstract: Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from
interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies
often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting
their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a
possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of
processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor
diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal
information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR
integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former).
Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and
corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for
domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust
training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures
depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's
ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression
diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two
interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) are opening up new
opportunities in geotechnical engineering and engineering geology. While
general-purpose LLMs possess broad capabilities, effective application in
geotechnics often requires domain-specific adaptation. Such tailored LLMs are
increasingly employed to streamline geotechnical workflows. This paper presents
the first survey of the adaptation and application of LLMs in geotechnical
engineering. It outlines key methodologies for adaptation to geotechnical
domain, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation,
domain-adaptive pretraining, and fine-tuning. The survey examines the
state-of-the-art applications of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, including
geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, site planning, design
calculations, numerical modeling, safety and risk assessment, and educational
tutoring. It also analyzes benefits and limitations of geotechnical-adapted
LLMs, and identifies promising directions for future research in this
interdisciplinary discipline. The findings serve as a valuable resource for
practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into geotechnical practice, while also
providing a foundation to stimulate further investigation within the academic

### [17] [ADMC: Attention-based Diffusion Model for Missing Modalities Feature Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05624)
*Wei Zhang,Juan Chen,Yanbo J. Wang,En Zhu,Xuan Yang,Yiduo Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力扩散模型（ADMC）的多模态情感和意图识别方法，解决了传统方法在缺失模态时的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感和意图识别中，传感器故障或数据不完整导致模态缺失，传统方法因过度耦合和生成不精确而效果不佳。

Method: 独立训练各模态特征提取网络，避免过度耦合；使用注意力扩散网络（ADN）生成缺失模态特征。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MIntRec基准测试中取得最优结果，适用于缺失和完整模态场景。

Conclusion: ADMC框架有效解决了模态缺失问题，提升了多模态情感和意图识别的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion and intent recognition is essential for automated
human-computer interaction, It aims to analyze users' speech, text, and visual
information to predict their emotions or intent. One of the significant
challenges is that missing modalities due to sensor malfunctions or incomplete
data. Traditional methods that attempt to reconstruct missing information often
suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation processes, leading to
suboptimal outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-based
Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC). Our framework
independently trains feature extraction networks for each modality, preserving
their unique characteristics and avoiding over-coupling. The Attention-based
Diffusion Network (ADN) generates missing modality features that closely align
with authentic multimodal distribution, enhancing performance across all
missing-modality scenarios. Moreover, ADN's cross-modal generation offers
improved recognition even in full-modality contexts. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, demonstrating
its effectiveness in both missing and complete modality scenarios.

*Yuan An,John Liu,Niyam Acharya,Ruhma Hashmi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM生成的检索练习问题显著提高了学生的知识保留率，但需人工验证质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教师生成高质量检索练习问题耗时的问题，探索LLM自动生成问题的有效性。

Method: 在两个大学数据科学课程中，比较学生使用LLM生成的多选题与无练习时的学习效果。

Result: 使用LLM生成问题的学生知识保留率显著提高（89% vs 73%）。

Conclusion: LLM生成的检索练习问题可有效支持学习，但需人工验证以确保质量。

Abstract: Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to
significantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However,
generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming
and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical
subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this
process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness
of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be
established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two
college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared
learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated
multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no
such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to
LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge
retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without
such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions
can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution
for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite
these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions
must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors
must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing
them to students.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了生成式AI和社交媒体中信息传播的复杂性，提出了一种基于LLM的模拟环境，并通过SIP-CoT机制增强其社会智能和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型（如SIR）和现有高级方法（如注意力机制和图神经网络）未能充分捕捉在线互动的复杂性和用户心理动态，LLM的潜力尚未完全发挥。

Method: 引入基于LLM的模拟环境，结合SIP-CoT机制和情感引导记忆，改进社会信息处理。

Result: 实验表明，SIP-CoT增强的LLM代理能更真实地模拟人类行为、态度和情感。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLM模拟的局限性，并证明SIP-CoT和情感记忆的整合显著提升了LLM代理的社会智能和真实性。

Abstract: The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed
information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the
spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and
developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful
content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but
inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods,
including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but
typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language
models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for
simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an
LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes,
emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant
gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially
in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through
Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in
goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional
processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the
Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism
enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of
social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental
results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process
social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to
real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical
limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how
integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social
intelligence and realism of LLM agents.

*Tianxing Wu,Lizhe Cao,Shuang Wang,Jiming Wang,Shutong Zhu,Yerong Wu,Yuqing Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于司法数据的表格学习方法（TLJD），用于城市级外国直接投资（FDI）预测，解决了传统经济数据可能被操纵的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为实现联合国可持续发展目标，FDI对经济增长和创新至关重要。传统经济数据（如GDP）可能不可靠，因此需要利用司法数据来预测FDI。

Method: 基于1200万份公开裁决文件构建司法绩效评估指标体系，提出TLJD方法，结合行数据和列数据进行指标编码，并使用混合专家模型调整权重。

Result: TLJD在跨城市和跨时间任务中表现优异（R2至少0.92），优于其他十种先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 司法数据可用于可靠的城市级FDI预测，TLJD方法在预测性能上具有显著优势。

Abstract: To advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on promoting
sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, foreign direct
investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in catalyzing economic expansion and
fostering innovation. Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for
local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP).
However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions
less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial
data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security
and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an
index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million
publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset
is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data
(TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data
in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and
utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different
indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of
TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions.
Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach
to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different
evaluation metrics.

*Dipayan Sengupta,Saumya Panda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究比较了人类专家与两种AI模型（通用型和推理型）生成的皮肤病治疗计划，发现评估结果因评估者不同而显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在医疗领域的扩展，评估AI生成的治疗计划成为关键挑战，尤其是新型推理模型的出现。

Method: 10位皮肤科医生、通用AI（GPT-4o）和推理AI（o3）为5个复杂皮肤病案例生成治疗计划，由人类专家和高级AI法官（Gemini 2.5 Pro）匿名评分。

Result: 人类专家评分显著高于AI计划，而AI法官则完全相反，评分AI计划更高。推理AI（o3）在AI法官中排名第一，但在人类评分中表现较差。

Conclusion: 临床计划的质量感知取决于评估者的性质，揭示了经验启发式与数据驱动逻辑之间的差距，未来需发展可解释的人机协同系统。

Abstract: Background: Evaluating AI-generated treatment plans is a key challenge as AI
expands beyond diagnostics, especially with new reasoning models. This study
compares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a
reasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.
  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI
(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The
anonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human
experts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical
rubric.
  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored
peer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;
p=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th
(mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI
plans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It
ranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.
  Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally
dependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by
human experts, was judged as superior by a sophisticated AI, revealing a deep
gap between experience-based clinical heuristics and data-driven algorithmic
logic. This paradox presents a critical challenge for AI integration,
suggesting the future requires synergistic, explainable human-AI systems that
bridge this reasoning gap to augment clinical care.

*Lukas Kuhn,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ModelAuditor是一个自反思代理工具，帮助用户识别和修复AI模型在临床实践中可能出现的失败模式，通过模拟分布偏移生成可解释报告，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型在临床实践中可能因现实世界的变化（如硬件、光照或人口统计差异）而失效，目前缺乏可访问且可解释的工具来提前发现和修复这些失败模式。

Method: ModelAuditor通过与用户对话、选择任务特定指标、模拟临床相关分布偏移，生成解释性报告，识别失败模式并提供缓解策略。

Result: 在三种临床场景中，ModelAuditor成功识别失败模式，并通过针对性建议恢复15-25%的性能损失，优于基线模型和现有增强方法。

Conclusion: ModelAuditor提供了一种高效、低成本的方法，显著提升AI模型在临床实践中的可靠性。

Abstract: The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge:
models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail
catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging.
Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy,
but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases
before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack
accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.
Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with
users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent,
clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates
interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during
deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root
causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three
real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in
histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity
in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly
identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the
established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover
15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially
outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods.
These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute
on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于充电结束阶段放电脉冲分析的方法，用于实时监测电池健康状态（SoH），实验结果显示预测准确且可解释性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微电网中电池健康状态的实时监测面临挑战，传统方法受限，需要创新解决方案。

Method: 通过分析充电结束阶段的放电脉冲，利用等效电气模型参数估计SoH。

Result: 实验数据显示，该方法预测电池退化时平均绝对误差约1%，可解释性评分接近0.9。

Conclusion: 该方法有望集成到电池管理系统（BMS）中，为持续运行的电池管理优化提供支持。

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of the state of health (SoH) of batteries remains a
major challenge, particularly in microgrids where operational constraints limit
the use of traditional methods. As part of the 4BLife project, we propose an
innovative method based on the analysis of a discharge pulse at the end of the
charge phase. The parameters of the equivalent electrical model describing the
voltage evolution across the battery terminals during this current pulse are
then used to estimate the SoH. Based on the experimental data acquired so far,
the initial results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach. After
training using the parameters of two batteries with a capacity degradation of
around 85%, we successfully predicted the degradation of two other batteries,
cycled down to approximately 90% SoH, with a mean absolute error of around 1%
in the worst case, and an explainability score of the estimator close to 0.9.
If these performances are confirmed, this method can be easily integrated into
battery management systems (BMS) and paves the way for optimized battery
management under continuous operation.

Motivation: 解决GUI代理在任务规划中的模糊性和复杂界面中精准交互的挑战。

Method: 引入测试时缩放方法选择最佳动作提案，并利用强化学习模型提升视觉元素的精准交互。

Result: 在Screenspot-Pro、Screenspot-V2和OSWorld-G等基准测试中取得了最优性能，任务成功率显著提升。

Conclusion: GTA1通过测试时缩放和强化学习方法，显著提升了GUI代理的性能，为相关领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms
(e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements.
Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action
proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each
action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.
However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning
(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is
non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in
complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual
targets.
  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI
Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate
action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we
sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to
evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better
decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and
improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves
improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its
corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning
(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,
rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.
  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%
accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When
paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits
state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on
OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在ROP风险预测中的潜力，填补现有研究的空白，并研究情感提示对模型预测和偏见的影响。

Method: 使用CROP数据集（993条记录），结合三种提示策略（Instruction、CoT、ICL）和情感元素，评估LLMs的预测能力和情感偏见。

Result: LLMs在外部知识辅助下表现更好；情感偏见明显，但积极情感提示能减少预测偏差。

Conclusion: 情感敏感的提示工程对提升诊断可靠性至关重要，Affective-ROPTester是评估和减轻临床语言模型情感偏见的有效工具。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across
various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel
Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records
annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the
predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk
stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation
framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme
assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and
ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.
Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate
how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP
and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield
two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP
risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit
marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.
Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent
inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared
to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating
predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of
affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and
emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and
mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.

Conclusion: CogniPlay有望填补AI与人类决策间的差距，推动更人性化的游戏AI发展。

Abstract: While AI systems have equaled or surpassed human performance in a wide
variety of games such as Chess, Go, or Dota 2, describing these systems as
truly "human-like" remains far-fetched. Despite their success, they fail to
replicate the pattern-based, intuitive decision-making processes observed in
human cognition. This paper presents an overview of findings from cognitive
psychology and previous efforts to model human-like behavior in artificial
agents, discusses their applicability to General Game Playing (GGP) and
introduces our work-in-progress model based on these observations: CogniPlay.

Abstract: With the advent of Transformers, time series forecasting has seen significant
advances, yet it remains challenging due to the need for effective sequence
representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Time
series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence
representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future
projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct
task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate
predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this
work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages:
input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction,
and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of
architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules,
such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention
mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks,
including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational
efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter
count. The source code is available at

Conclusion: MusiScene模型在音乐场景想象任务中表现优异，为跨模态音乐理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music,
envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow,
melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies
suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g.
MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI),
which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To
improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical
elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine
scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a
large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music
Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct
comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of
generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA. We leverage the
generated MSI captions to enhance Video Background Music Generation (VBMG) from

Result: 在文本和多模态基准测试中表现优异，数据效率高，性能接近或超越更大模型。

Conclusion: BlueLM-2.5-3B为高性能设备端多模态大语言模型的发展提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: We present BlueLM-2.5-3B, a compact and unified dense Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) designed for efficient edge-device deployment, offering
strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and
non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token
budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data
resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance
training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while
preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters.
We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and
text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable
performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger
Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In
non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal
benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency.
All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total
training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to
the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful
insights to the research community.

Conclusion: 提出的基础模型为无线网络中的多任务预测提供了一种高效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication
networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state
information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for
a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer
tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely
applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across
different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation
model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse
prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to
unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses
a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we
introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input
lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model
demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot
performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于属性的方法，用于提高可解释AI在乳腺癌淋巴结放疗后淋巴水肿风险评估中的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动的AI技术缺乏透明度，限制了其在医疗决策中的可解释性和接受度。

Method: 通过信息检索技术的标准指标，对基于规则的预测模型中的属性进行统计分析，计算每个属性对预测的相关性。

Result: 用户研究表明，该方法生成的输出比原始可解释AI模型的输出更具可解释性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升AI预测在医疗决策中的透明度和接受度。

Abstract: The lack of transparency of data-driven Artificial Intelligence techniques
limits their interpretability and acceptance into healthcare decision-making
processes. We propose an attribution-based approach to improve the
interpretability of Explainable AI-based predictions in the specific context of
arm lymphedema's risk assessment after lymph nodal radiotherapy in breast
cancer. The proposed method performs a statistical analysis of the attributes
in the rule-based prediction model using standard metrics from Information
Retrieval techniques. This analysis computes the relevance of each attribute to
the prediction and provides users with interpretable information about the
impact of risk factors. The results of a user study that compared the output
generated by the proposed approach with the raw output of the Explainable AI
model suggested higher levels of interpretability and usefulness in the context
of predicting lymphedema risk.

TL;DR: HopeBot是一种基于大型语言模型的聊天机器人，用于抑郁症筛查，相比传统静态工具PHQ-9更具互动性和适应性，用户反馈积极。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抑郁症筛查工具如PHQ-9缺乏互动性和适应性，HopeBot旨在通过聊天机器人技术提供更灵活、支持性的筛查体验。

Method: 开发了HopeBot，结合检索增强生成和实时澄清技术，进行了一项132人的跨文化研究，比较自填和聊天机器人版本的PHQ-9。

Result: HopeBot与自填版PHQ-9得分高度一致（ICC=0.91），71%用户更信任聊天机器人，87.1%愿意重复使用或推荐。

Conclusion: 基于语音的LLM聊天机器人可作为抑郁症筛查的可扩展、低负担辅助工具。

Abstract: Static tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) effectively
screen depression but lack interactivity and adaptability. We developed
HopeBot, a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) that administers the
PHQ-9 using retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification. In a
within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both
self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement
(ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative
feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer
structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10)
were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics,
and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by
employment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall,
87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings
demonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden
adjuncts for routine depression screening.

*Kushal Gajjar,Harshit Sikchi,Arpit Singh Gautam,Marc Hammons,Saurabh Jha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogniSQL-R1-Zero是一种基于强化学习的框架，用于将自然语言转换为SQL，通过轻量级奖励信号实现高准确率，并在Text2SQL基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在生成复杂SQL查询时的准确性和可执行性问题。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，利用执行正确性和格式标签合规性作为奖励信号，避免中间监督和复杂奖励设计。

Result: 在Text2SQL基准测试中达到最先进的执行准确率，优于多个大型模型。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了强化学习在高效、可扩展的Text-to-SQL生成中的潜力，并发布了两个数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL) remains a core challenge
at the intersection of language understanding and structured data access.
Although large language models (LLMs) have improved fluency, generating correct
and executable SQL, especially for complex queries, continues to be
challenging. We introduce CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework and model that produces accurate SQL using a lightweight reward
signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance. By avoiding
intermediate supervision, hybrid pipelines and complex reward shaping, our
method encourages stable learning and stronger alignment with the ultimate task
objective-producing executable programs. CogniSQL-R1-Zero achieves
state-of-the-art execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmark; BIRD bench,
outperforming prior supervised and instruction-tuned baselines including SFT
CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B-despite being trained on a
significantly smaller 7B backbone. This result underscores the scalability and
efficiency of our RL-based approach when trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs
(40 GB VRAM each). To support further research in efficient and interpretable
Text-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of
5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a
positive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each
annotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these
contributions advance scalable, execution-aligned Text-to-SQL generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XAI方法对非专业用户生成的解释不够清晰，FGNS旨在提升解释的可理解性。

Method: FGNS是一种事后方法，通过局部和全局特征重要性选择类代表性样本。

Result: 在用户研究中，FGNS显著提升非专家识别模型错误的能力，且决策更快更准。

Conclusion: FGNS是迈向更人性化模型评估的一步，但需进一步缩小解释质量与用户信任之间的差距。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods often struggle to generate clear, interpretable
outputs for users without domain expertise. We introduce Feature-Guided
Neighbor Selection (FGNS), a post hoc method that enhances interpretability by
selecting class-representative examples using both local and global feature
importance. In a user study (N = 98) evaluating Kannada script classifications,
FGNS significantly improved non-experts' ability to identify model errors while
maintaining appropriate agreement with correct predictions. Participants made
faster and more accurate decisions compared to those given traditional k-NN
explanations. Quantitative analysis shows that FGNS selects neighbors that
better reflect class characteristics rather than merely minimizing
feature-space distance, leading to more consistent selection and tighter
clustering around class prototypes. These results support FGNS as a step toward
more human-aligned model assessment, although further work is needed to address
the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lockean信念集通常不闭合于经典逻辑演绎，这限制了其在某些领域的应用（如信念变化理论）。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了两种使信念集闭合于经典逻辑演绎的特征化方法，并设计了一种最小化修订的更新方法。

Result: 展示了如何通过最小修订使信念集闭合于演绎逻辑。

Conclusion: 本文的方法为Lockean信念集在逻辑闭合和最小修订方面提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Within the formal setting of the Lockean thesis, an agent belief set is
defined in terms of degrees of confidence and these are described in
probabilistic terms. This approach is of established interest, notwithstanding
some limitations that make its use troublesome in some contexts, like, for
instance, in belief change theory. Precisely, Lockean belief sets are not
generally closed under (classical) logical deduction. The aim of the present
paper is twofold: on one side we provide two characterizations of those belief
sets that are closed under classical logic deduction, and on the other we
propose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal
revision of those beliefs, i.e., a revision obtained by making the fewest
possible changes to the existing belief set while still accommodating the new
information. In particular, we show how we can deductively close a belief set
via a minimal revision.

TL;DR: FEVO框架通过多阶段增强提升LLM在金融领域的性能，包括持续预训练、监督微调和强化学习，并在多个基准测试中取得最优表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在将LLM应用于需要领域知识的金融领域进展有限，因此提出FEVO框架以填补这一空白。

Method: FEVO采用持续预训练（CPT）扩展金融知识，监督微调（SFT）培养结构化推理，强化学习（RL）整合知识与推理。

Result: FEVO-R32B在五个金融基准测试中表现最优，验证了金融知识扩展和结构化推理的有效性。

Conclusion: FEVO框架显著提升了LLM在金融领域的性能，证明了多阶段增强方法的有效性。

Abstract: Advancements in reasoning for large language models (LLMs) have lead to
significant performance improvements for LLMs in various fields such as
mathematics and programming. However, research applying these advances to the
financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to
complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO
(Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance
LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM
performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain
knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate
reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the
expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To
ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models
and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets
specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our
framework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from
Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and
general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves
state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger
models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates
markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge
expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合LSTM、遗传算法和SHAP的AI框架，用于提升医疗设施的能源管理效率，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗设施能源需求波动大，传统方法效率低且成本高，亟需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用LSTM进行时间序列预测，遗传算法优化参数和负载平衡，SHAP增强模型透明性。

Result: LSTM在预测性能上显著优于ARIMA和Prophet（MAE和RMSE更低），遗传算法和SHAP进一步提升了模型的适应性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为医疗设施能源管理提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，未来可结合强化学习进一步优化。

Abstract: This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in
healthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational
efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate,
causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an
AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm
(GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for
healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series
forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains
underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and
Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE:
87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm
is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies,
enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis
further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different
features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This
integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving
forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability
in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and
hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall,
the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy
management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenAgentSafety是一个模块化框架，用于评估AI代理在真实工具环境中的安全性，涵盖八类风险，支持多任务和多用户场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖模拟环境或狭窄任务域，无法全面评估AI代理在真实世界中的安全风险。

Method: OpenAgentSafety框架结合规则分析和LLM评估，支持真实工具交互和多任务测试。

Result: 实验显示，不同LLM在安全漏洞任务中的不安全行为比例从51.2%到72.7%。

Conclusion: OpenAgentSafety揭示了AI代理的安全漏洞，强调实际部署前需加强安全保障。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI agents capable of solving complex, everyday tasks, from
scheduling to customer service, have enabled deployment in real-world settings,
but their possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While
prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by
relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool
abstractions. We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular
framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories.
Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real
tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash
shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user
tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is
designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites,
and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis
with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.
Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe
behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7%
with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for
stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.

*Scott Geng,Hamish Ivison,Chun-Liang Li,Maarten Sap,Jerry Li,Ranjay Krishna,Pang Wei Koh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过配对偏好数据（即使数据点本身较弱）提升语言模型性能的方法，称为delta学习假设，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强监督数据稀缺的情况下，如何利用弱数据点提升模型性能是一个关键问题。

Method: 提出delta学习假设，利用配对偏好数据中的相对质量差异进行模型训练，并通过实验验证其效果。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，该方法达到了与Tulu 3相当的性能，且无需依赖强监督数据。

Conclusion: delta学习为模型训练提供了一种更简单、更经济的途径，展示了从弱数据中学习的潜力。

Abstract: Improvements in language models are often driven by improving the quality of
the data we train them on, which can be limiting when strong supervision is
scarce. In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of
individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each
individual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain
this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points
suffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised
finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled
experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data
generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even
smaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard
11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the
performance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base
model while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta
learning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art
post-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic
regression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides
useful signal for improving a stronger student. Overall, our work shows that
models can learn surprisingly well from paired data that might typically be
considered weak.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测数据中因果图通常不完整，尤其在复杂或高维场景下，需要简化表示以保留部分因果信息。

Method: 提出并形式化了因果抽象下的可识别性标准，并将其组织成层次结构，展示其关系。

Result: 建立了可识别性标准的层次结构，帮助理解在不同因果知识水平下可识别的因果查询。

Conclusion: 该框架为因果知识不完整时的可识别性提供了工具和清晰的理解。

Abstract: Identifying the effect of a treatment from observational data typically
requires assuming a fully specified causal diagram. However, such diagrams are
rarely known in practice, especially in complex or high-dimensional settings.
To overcome this limitation, recent works have explored the use of causal
abstractions-simplified representations that retain partial causal information.
In this paper, we consider causal abstractions formalized as collections of
causal diagrams, and focus on the identifiability of causal queries within such
collections. We introduce and formalize several identifiability criteria under
this setting. Our main contribution is to organize these criteria into a
structured hierarchy, highlighting their relationships. This hierarchical view
enables a clearer understanding of what can be identified under varying levels
of causal knowledge. We illustrate our framework through examples from the
literature and provide tools to reason about identifiability when full causal
knowledge is unavailable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的正确评分规则在文本信息获取中可能无法与人类偏好对齐，因此需要设计一种新的评分规则。

Method: 设计ASR，通过最小化正确评分规则与参考评分（如人类评分）之间的均方误差。

Result: 实验表明，ASR在保持正确性的同时，能更好地与人类偏好对齐。

Conclusion: ASR是一种有效的评分规则，既能保持正确性，又能更好地满足人类偏好。

Abstract: Scoring rules elicit probabilistic predictions from a strategic agent by
scoring the prediction against a ground truth state. A scoring rule is proper
if, from the agent's perspective, reporting the true belief maximizes the
expected score. With the development of language models, Wu and Hartline (2024)
proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical
(i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable
properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are
well aligned with human preference over text. Our paper designs the Aligned
Scoring rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error
between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). Our
experiments show that our ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with
human preference while maintaining properness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在验证LLM生成响应的正确性时，尤其是在特定关键词（如数字、年份或名称）的归因上表现不足。

Method: 提出TokenShapley方法，结合Shapley值的数据归因和KNN检索技术，利用预计算的数据存储进行上下文检索。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，TokenShapley在令牌级归因上优于现有方法，准确率提高了11-23%。

Conclusion: TokenShapley为LLM生成响应的细粒度数据归因提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in in-context
learning, but verifying the correctness of their generated responses remains a
challenge. Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these
methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the
response, such as numbers, years, or names. To address this limitation, we
propose TokenShapley, a novel token-level attribution method that combines
Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques
inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs. By leveraging a precomputed
datastore for contextual retrieval and computing Shapley values to quantify
token importance, TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution
approach. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an
11-23% improvement in accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据污染问题，传统方法难以准确衡量大语言模型的泛化能力，因此需要一种更可靠且可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于用户行为预测的新框架，并在电影和音乐推荐数据集上测试了GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini和Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct模型。

Result: 实验结果显示GPT-4o表现优于GPT-4o-mini和Llama，但所有模型仍有改进空间，尤其是Llama。

Conclusion: 用户行为预测是一种理论上合理、可扩展且稳健的衡量泛化能力的方法，未来可进一步优化模型表现。

Abstract: Measuring the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
challenging due to data contamination. As models grow and computation becomes
cheaper, ensuring tasks and test cases are unseen during training phases will
become nearly impossible. We argue that knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks
are not ideal for measuring generalization, as LLMs are not trained for
specific tasks. Instead, we propose user behavior prediction, also a key aspect
of personalization, as a theoretically sound, scalable, and robust alternative.
We introduce a novel framework for this approach and test it on movie and music
recommendation datasets for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.
Results align with our framework's predictions, showing GPT-4o outperforms
GPT-4o-mini and Llama, though all models have much room for improvement,
especially Llama.

Motivation: 社交媒体中隐式性别歧视内容广泛传播，但传统检测方法难以捕捉其微妙特征。

Method: 采用阈值对比学习优化嵌入空间，结合交叉熵损失和词级注意力模块，并利用情感、情绪和毒性特征。

Result: 在EXIST2021和MLSC数据集上，ASCEND平均Macro F1提升9.86%、29.63%和32.51%。

Conclusion: ASCEND能有效捕捉隐式性别歧视的细微线索，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The global reach of social media has amplified the spread of hateful content,
including implicit sexism, which is often overlooked by conventional detection
methods. In this work, we introduce an Adaptive Supervised Contrastive lEarning
framework for implicit sexism detectioN (ASCEND). A key innovation of our
method is the incorporation of threshold-based contrastive learning: by
computing cosine similarities between embeddings, we selectively treat only
those sample pairs as positive if their similarity exceeds a learnable
threshold. This mechanism refines the embedding space by robustly pulling
together representations of semantically similar texts while pushing apart
dissimilar ones, thus reducing false positives and negatives. The final
classification is achieved by jointly optimizing a contrastive loss with a
cross-entropy loss. Textual features are enhanced through a word-level
attention module. Additionally, we employ sentiment, emotion, and toxicity
features. Evaluations on the EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets demonstrate that
ASCEND significantly outperforms existing methods, with average Macro F1
improvements of 9.86%, 29.63%, and 32.51% across multiple tasks, highlighting
its efficacy in capturing the subtle cues of implicit sexist language.

Motivation: 解决远程教育中学生辍学问题，传统机器学习模型难以捕捉情感和上下文因素，导致预测效果不佳。

Method: 结合检索增强生成（RAG）进行情感分析，提示工程解码学业压力，跨模态注意力融合文本、行为和社会人口学数据。

Result: 在4,423名学生数据集上，准确率达89%，F1分数0.88，优于传统模型7%，减少假阴性21%。

Abstract: Student dropout in distance learning remains a critical challenge, with
profound societal and economic consequences. While classical machine learning
models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often
fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in
unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI
framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic
innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment
analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors, and cross-modal
attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and
socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated
knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets
student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized
prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload
anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with
temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk profiles. Evaluated on a
longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and
an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false
negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable
interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship
programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive
analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate
dropout risks in global education systems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成出院摘要时存在幻觉问题，且难以将生成内容与电子病历（EMRs）关联。

Method: LCDS通过计算EMRs与出院摘要的文本相似性构建源映射表，并结合逻辑规则生成可靠的摘要。

Result: LCDS能够生成更可靠的出院摘要，并支持内容溯源，便于专家审查和反馈。

Conclusion: LCDS有效解决了LLMs在出院摘要生成中的问题，并通过逐步微调提升模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
automated discharge summary generation, they still suffer from hallucination
issues, such as generating inaccurate content or fabricating information
without valid sources. In addition, electronic medical records (EMRs) typically
consist of long-form data, making it challenging for LLMs to attribute the
generated content to the sources. To address these challenges, we propose LCDS,
a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a
source mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and
discharge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content. Moreover,
LCDS incorporates a comprehensive set of logical rules, enabling it to generate
more reliable silver discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields.
Furthermore, LCDS supports source attribution for generated content, allowing
experts to efficiently review, provide feedback, and rectify errors. The
resulting golden discharge summaries are subsequently recorded for incremental
fine-tuning of LLMs. Our project and demo video are in the GitHub repository

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大型语言模型中，训练时使用低效但连贯的推理轨迹比使用最优轨迹能带来更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究推理轨迹的结构和冗余对大型语言模型推理能力的影响。

Method: 通过最短路径任务训练解码器模型，比较使用最优动态规划轨迹和低效回溯轨迹的效果。

Result: 训练时使用低效但连贯的推理轨迹能提升模型泛化能力，而单纯增加冗余无益。

Conclusion: 连贯且局部增量的推理轨迹更易于优化训练信号，从而提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing highlight two key factors for
improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs): (i) allocating more
test-time compute tends to help on harder problems but often introduces
redundancy in the reasoning trace, and (ii) compute is most effective when
reasoning is systematic and incremental, forming structured chains of thought
(CoTs) akin to human problem-solving. To study these factors in isolation, we
introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs.
We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a
custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic
programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving
backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained
on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not
due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails
to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization
correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting
that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal
easier to optimize.

Conclusion: EduCoder填补了教育对话标注工具的空白，为研究者和教育专家提供了高效工具。

Abstract: We introduce EduCoder, a domain-specialized tool designed to support
utterance-level annotation of educational dialogue. While general-purpose text
annotation tools for NLP and qualitative research abound, few address the
complexities of coding education dialogue transcripts -- with diverse
teacher-student and peer interactions. Common challenges include defining
codebooks for complex pedagogical features, supporting both open-ended and
categorical coding, and contextualizing utterances with external features, such
as the lesson's purpose and the pedagogical value of the instruction. EduCoder
is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for researchers
and domain experts to collaboratively define complex codebooks based on
observed data. It incorporates both categorical and open-ended annotation types
along with contextual materials. Additionally, it offers a side-by-side
comparison of multiple annotators' responses, allowing comparison and
calibration of annotations with others to improve data reliability. The system
is open-source, with a demo video available.

TL;DR: 本文提出InfoRidge框架，通过信息论分析Transformer中间层在训练中如何传递任务相关信息，发现预测信息在中间层达到峰值（形成“泛化岭”），并揭示了中间层在泛化中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在自然语言生成任务中表现优异，但其内部机制如何合成任务相关信息仍不清楚，尤其是中间层泛化能力的形成与传播。

Method: 提出InfoRidge框架，通过信息论量化隐藏表示与目标输出的互信息，并引入残差缩放系数作为功能探针。

Result: 实验显示预测信息在中间层达到峰值（泛化岭），且在分布偏移下模型更依赖中间层。

Conclusion: 中间层在Transformer的泛化中起关键作用，为理解其内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in natural language generation (NLG) tasks, yet their internal mechanisms for
synthesizing task-relevant information remain insufficiently understood. While
prior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable
representations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and
propagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,
we propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how
predictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations
and target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to
trace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during
training. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a
consistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle
layers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,
reflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further
investigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling
coefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which
serve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual
transformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift,
models downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers,
highlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new
insights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the
critical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.

Motivation: 用户通过商业API访问大型语言模型时需暴露数据，存在隐私风险。研究旨在让用户通过隐私配置文件控制数据共享。

Method: 构建框架，本地模型根据隐私指令重写查询，隐藏敏感信息后再发送给外部模型。引入PEEP数据集支持研究。

Result: 轻量级LLM能部分遵循隐私指令，但仍面临挑战，需改进模型对用户隐私偏好的理解与遵从。

Conclusion: 隐私配置文件是可行的隐私保护方法，但需进一步优化模型能力以实现更好的隐私控制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but
this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this
paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy
profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should
not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these
instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the
user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with
performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual
dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with
synthetic privacy profiles. Our experiments with lightweight LLMs show they can
follow these instructions to some extent, but also face consistent challenges,
highlighting the need for models that better understand and comply with
user-defined privacy preferences.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言推理任务中表现不足，尤其是低资源语言，导致事实准确性、可解释性和信任问题。

Method: 提出GeoFact-X基准和BRIDGE训练方法，结合监督微调和测试时强化学习，通过语言一致性奖励对齐推理语言。

Result: BRIDGE显著提升了多语言推理的准确性，证明了推理感知的多语言强化学习对跨语言泛化的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多语言推理能力的重要性，并展示了BRIDGE在提升模型跨语言表现方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like
mathematics, factual QA, and code generation, yet their multilingual reasoning
capabilities in these tasks remain underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource
languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or
default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource
languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current
multilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models
actually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce
GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with
annotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese,
Swahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that
guides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a
language-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language.
Finally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to
assess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning
traces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics.
Our results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning
fidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement
learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.

TL;DR: 论文提出CoPE框架，评估大语言模型如何整合上下文知识和参数知识，发现模型存在“later-in-the-lost”现象，即忽略后文信息。CoT提示会降低上下文利用，而基于CK的提示能改善事实性和减少幻觉。

Motivation: 探索大语言模型如何优先和整合上下文知识与参数知识，填补研究空白。

Method: 引入CoPE评估框架，使用MultiWikiAtomic数据集分析模型在开放问答中的表现，发现“lost-in-the-later”现象。

Result: 模型存在位置偏见，CoT提示降低上下文利用；基于CK的提示改善事实性。

Conclusion: CoPE框架揭示了模型整合知识的局限性，CK提示是优化模型性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models are capable of leveraging both contextual and
parametric knowledge but how they prioritize and integrate these sources
remains underexplored. We introduce CoPE, a novel evaluation framework that
systematically measures contextual knowledge (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK)
across models and languages. Using our MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English,
Spanish, and Danish, we analyze how large language models (LLMs) integrate
context, prioritize information, and incorporate PK in open-ended question
answering. Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where
LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given
context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding.
We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted
with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models
without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting,
in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to
degraded contextual grounding. Based on these insights, we design prompt-based
methods to effectively leverage input context. A case study applying CoPE to
summarization demonstrates that CK-informed prompting improves factual
grounding and reduces hallucination.

Motivation: 探讨性别和地方背景如何影响堕胎议题的公众讨论，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过分析近1000万条X（原Twitter）上带有性别、意识形态和地理位置信息的堕胎相关帖子。

Result: 性别显著影响堕胎态度和情感表达，尤其在保守地区，且与意识形态无关。Dobbs案草案泄露进一步激化了在线讨论，动员了更多支持堕胎的女性。

Conclusion: 堕胎讨论不仅受意识形态极化影响，还深刻受性别和地方背景塑造，突显身份在制度动荡时期政治表达中的核心作用。

Abstract: The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
Organization marked a turning point in the national debate over reproductive
rights. While the ideological divide over abortion is well documented, less is
known about how gender and local sociopolitical contexts interact to shape
public discourse. Drawing on nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X
(formerly Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology and location, we
show that gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional
expression, particularly in conservative regions, and independently of
ideology. This creates a gender gap in abortion attitudes that grows more
pronounced in conservative regions. The leak of the Dobbs draft opinion further
intensified online engagement, disproportionately mobilizing pro-abortion women
in areas where access was under threat. These findings reveal that abortion
discourse is not only ideologically polarized but also deeply structured by
gender and place, highlighting the central role of identity in shaping
political expression during moments of institutional disruption.

Result: PhoniTale的表现与人工生成的助记词相当，并通过短期记忆测试验证了其实际效果。

Conclusion: PhoniTale在助记词生成方面具有潜力，但需进一步改进助记词质量和生成方法。

Abstract: Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2)
learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as
English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate
vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's
first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this
research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages,
rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel
cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence
based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We
evaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations,
comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated
approaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term
recall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale
performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas
for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrated the potential to
replicate human language abilities through technology, ranging from text

what extent these systems truly understand language. We examine this issue by
narrowing the question down to the semantics of LLMs at the word and sentence
level. By examining the inner workings of LLMs and their generated
representation of language and by drawing on classical semantic theories by
Frege and Russell, we get a more nuanced picture of the potential semantic
capabilities of LLMs.

Result: 现有工具在MODELCITIZENS上表现不佳，而新模型比GPT-o4-mini提升5.5%。

Conclusion: 社区标注和建模对包容性内容审核至关重要。

Abstract: Automatic toxic language detection is critical for creating safe, inclusive
online spaces. However, it is a highly subjective task, with perceptions of
toxic language shaped by community norms and lived experience. Existing
toxicity detection models are typically trained on annotations that collapse
diverse annotator perspectives into a single ground truth, erasing important
context-specific notions of toxicity such as reclaimed language. To address
this, we introduce MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts and 40K
toxicity annotations across diverse identity groups. To capture the role of
conversational context on toxicity, typical of social media posts, we augment
MODELCITIZENS posts with LLM-generated conversational scenarios.
State-of-the-art toxicity detection tools (e.g. OpenAI Moderation API,
GPT-o4-mini) underperform on MODELCITIZENS, with further degradation on
context-augmented posts. Finally, we release LLAMACITIZEN-8B and
GEMMACITIZEN-12B, LLaMA- and Gemma-based models finetuned on MODELCITIZENS,
which outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5% on in-distribution evaluations. Our

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong
performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple
medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular
reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from
doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and
sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these
real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on
healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we
investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical
datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and
analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose
an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations,
enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further
research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source
datasets for nurse observation extraction and medical order extraction.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
leveraging additional computational resources at inference time to enhance
model performance. In this work, we introduce R2-LLMs, a novel and versatile
hierarchical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework designed to improve
test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) without requiring
distillation from more advanced models to obtain chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data. R2-LLMs enhances inference-time generalization by integrating
dual-level retrieval-based in-context learning: (1) At the coarse level, our
approach extracts abstract templates from complex reasoning problems and
retrieves similar problem-answer pairs to facilitate high-level in-context
learning; (2) At the fine level, during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), R2-LLMs
efficiently retrieves analogous intermediate solution steps from reference
mathematical problem datasets, refining step-wise reasoning with the aid of a
process reward model (PRM) for scoring. R2-LLMs is a robust hierarchical
reasoning-augmentation method that enhances in-context-level reasoning while
seamlessly integrating with step-level tree search methods. Utilizing PRM, it
refines both candidate generation and decision-making for improved reasoning
accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO
datasets achieve substantial relative improvement with an increase of up to 16%
using LLaMA-3.1-8B compared to the baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of
our approach in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Re5是一种高效且有效的方法，能以最少的外部监督提升指令遵循能力。

Abstract: Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs)
adherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective
approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.
However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a
single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have
been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision
iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a
resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage
high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation
capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a
degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed
to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of
the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user
instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,
and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by
selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving
improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,
enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative
refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves
instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data

*Mingzhe Li,Jing Xiang,Qishen Zhang,Kaiyang Wan,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种翻转知识蒸馏范式，让大语言模型（LLM）从小语言模型（SLM）学习，结合LoRA技术解决架构差异，并通过Margin-aware Contrastive Learning（MCL）提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用小模型在特定任务（如文本匹配）中的优势与大模型的语义理解能力，提出翻转知识蒸馏。

Method: 通过LoRA将LLM重新解释为编码器-解码器结构，编码器生成压缩表示，解码器映射到输出空间，使用MCL对齐相似性分数。

Result: 在金融和医疗基准测试及实际应用中验证了有效性，并已在线部署。

Conclusion: 翻转知识蒸馏范式能有效结合小模型的专业优势与大模型的语义能力，提升性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large
Language Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks such
as text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective
domain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of
input pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the
rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge
distillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the
architectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by
reinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder
generates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output
space. During training, the encoder produces representations and their
similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the
teacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.
The MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and
adaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative
samples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing
the LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and
healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its
effectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SARA是一个统一的RAG框架，通过结合自然语言片段和语义压缩向量，平衡局部精度和全局知识覆盖，提升上下文效率和答案正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG中有效上下文长度受限和检索文档冗余的问题，同时避免压缩方法丢失关键细节。

Method: SARA采用双层次上下文表示（自然语言片段和语义压缩向量），并通过动态重排模块优化上下文选择。

Result: 在9个数据集和5个开源LLM上，SARA显著提升了答案相关性（+17.71）、正确性（+13.72）和语义相似性（+15.53）。

Conclusion: SARA证明了结合文本和压缩表示对高效RAG的重要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but faces key challenges: restricted effective context
length and redundancy in retrieved documents. Pure compression-based approaches
reduce input size but often discard fine-grained details essential for factual
accuracy. We propose SARA, a unified RAG framework that balances local
precision and global knowledge coverage under tight context budgets. SARA
combines natural-language text snippets with semantic compression vectors to
jointly enhance context efficiency and answer correctness. It represents
contexts at two complementary levels: 1) fine-grained natural-language spans
that preserve critical entities and numerical values, and 2) compact,
interpretable vectors that summarize high-level semantics. An iterative
evidence-selection module employs the compression vectors for dynamic reranking
of contexts. Across 9 datasets and 5 open-source LLMs spanning 3 model families
(Mistral, Llama, and Gemma), SARA consistently improves answer relevance
(+17.71), answer correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53),
demonstrating the importance of integrating textual and compressed
representations for robust, context-efficient RAG.

Motivation: 解决多语言大模型（LLMs）在生成响应时忽视提示语言、倾向于使用主导语言的问题。

Method: 选择性调整词级输出概率，抑制非目标语言生成，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 在Qwen模型上，非目标中文输出减少95%以上，同时保持多语言基准任务准确性。

Conclusion: Smoothie-Qwen为增强LLMs的语言可控性提供了高效实用的解决方案，适用于全球化应用。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often exhibit language confusion, a
tendency to generate responses in a dominant language irrespective of the
prompt's language. To address this, we propose Smoothie-Qwen, a lightweight,
post-hoc method that mitigates language bias without retraining. This technique
selectively adjusts token-level output probabilities to effectively suppress
undesired language generation. Applied to the Qwen model, our method reduces
unintended Chinese output by over 95% while preserving task accuracy on
multilingual benchmarks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution
for enhancing the language controllability of LLMs, making them more reliable
for global applications.

Tool-augmented agents address arithmetic via code execution, but often falter
on complex logical tasks. We introduce a fine-tuning framework, DualDistill,

dynamically selects the optimal strategy for each query, invoking tools for
arithmetic and algorithmic problems, and using text-based reasoning for
abstract ones. Our method improves accuracy across a range of tasks, including
both computation-intensive and standard benchmarks, demonstrating the

Motivation: 现有RAG基准测试多为英语且静态，无法反映实际动态部署需求，俄语资源尤为稀缺。

Method: 基于动态更新的俄语新闻和公共文档语料库，利用知识图谱自动生成问题，支持四种核心问题类型。

Result: 发布了完整的评估框架，包括问题生成管道、评估脚本和基准数据，并设立了公共排行榜。

Conclusion: DRAGON填补了俄语RAG动态评估的空白，为多语言和多模态扩展提供了潜力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted approach for
improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge at inference time. Although there exist multiple RAG
benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including
Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of
real-world deployments.
  In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first
dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news
corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and
public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever
and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with
the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the
extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns.
We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for
automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially
reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We
also launch a public leaderboard to encourage community participation and
comparison.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的检索增强生成（RAG）指令微调方法HIRAG，通过分层思维指令微调提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统依赖大语言模型的上下文学习能力，但缺乏对生成模型具体能力的深入研究，导致文档质量不一致和检索系统不完善的问题。

Method: 提出HIRAG方法，通过分层思维指令微调（包括过滤、组合和RAG特定推理能力）和“先思考再回答”策略，增强模型的开放书考试能力。

Result: 实验表明，HIRAG在RGB、PopQA、MuSiQue、HotpotQA和PubmedQA等数据集上显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: HIRAG方法通过分层思维指令微调有效解决了传统RAG系统的局限性，提升了生成模型的能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for
addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time
information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily
rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model
itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG
generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document
quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that
fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG
task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To
address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively
hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant
information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information
across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further
process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new
RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering"
strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by
utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the
HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on
datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE方法中，各层路由器独立选择专家，缺乏层间协作，限制了专家专业化。

Method: 提出Omni-router Transformer，通过共享路由器提升不同MoE层间专家的协作与专业化。

Result: 在大规模伪标记数据集和10个多样化ASR基准测试中，Omni-router Transformer表现优于密集和Switch Transformer模型，词错误率分别降低11.2%和8.2%。

Conclusion: 共享路由器设计提升了MoE模型的专家协作和专业化，显著改善了ASR任务的性能与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling
to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the
Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis
reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly
correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the
cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater
specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call
this model \emph{Omni-router Transformer}. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse,
out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is
able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and
Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%,
respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness
to diverse data.

Result: 实验表明，使用DocTalk预训练的模型在多轮对话能力上提升了40%。

Conclusion: DocTalk能显著提升大语言模型的多轮对话能力，且不影响基础性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in multi-turn
conversational tasks, yet their pre-training data predominantly consists of
continuous prose, creating a potential mismatch between required capabilities
and training paradigms. We introduce a novel approach to address this
discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We
present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into
an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our
pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training
dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that
exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can
enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory
and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during
pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding,
without compromising base performance. DocTalk is available at

Result: 部分LVLMs在特定对象类别上表现低于人类水平，日语提示下表现更差。

Conclusion: LVLMs在模态补全任务中表现参差不齐，日语能力存在缺陷。

Abstract: One of the main objectives in developing large vision-language models (LVLMs)
is to engineer systems that can assist humans with multimodal tasks, including
interpreting descriptions of perceptual experiences. A central phenomenon in
this context is amodal completion, in which people perceive objects even when
parts of those objects are hidden. Although numerous studies have assessed
whether computer-vision algorithms can detect or reconstruct occluded regions,
the inferential abilities of LVLMs on texts related to amodal completion remain
unexplored. To address this gap, we constructed a benchmark grounded in Basic
Formal Ontology to achieve a systematic classification of amodal completion.
Our results indicate that while many LVLMs achieve human-comparable performance
overall, their accuracy diverges for certain types of objects being completed.
Notably, in certain categories, some LLaVA-NeXT variants and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
exhibit lower accuracy on original images compared to blank stimuli lacking
visual content. Intriguingly, this disparity emerges only under Japanese
prompting, suggesting a deficiency in Japanese-specific linguistic competence
among these models.

Conclusion: 建议报告ASR性能和偏见时，采用更全面的度量方法，以更好地反映系统对不同说话人群体的表现和整体偏见。

Abstract: There is increasingly more evidence that automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems are biased against different speakers and speaker groups, e.g., due to
gender, age, or accent. Research on bias in ASR has so far primarily focused on
detecting and quantifying bias, and developing mitigation approaches. Despite
this progress, the open question is how to measure the performance and bias of
a system. In this study, we compare different performance and bias measures,
from literature and proposed, to evaluate state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR
systems for Dutch. Our experiments use several bias mitigation strategies to
address bias against different speaker groups. The findings reveal that
averaged error rates, a standard in ASR research, alone is not sufficient and
should be supplemented by other measures. The paper ends with recommendations
for reporting ASR performance and bias to better represent a system's
performance for diverse speaker groups, and overall system bias.

Method: 通过模拟具有多样化中介因素的虚拟受访者，识别能够稳健测量目标特质的调查项。实验基于三种心理特质理论（Big5、Schwartz、VIA）。

Conclusion: 该框架为低成本调查开发提供了新方向，并有助于理解LLM如何模拟人类行为。数据集和代码将公开以支持未来研究。

Abstract: As psychometric surveys are increasingly used to assess the traits of large
language models (LLMs), the need for scalable survey item generation suited for
LLMs has also grown. A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct
validity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended
trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.
To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation
using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which
the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By
simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that
robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait
theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and
simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate
the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to
simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,
metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective
survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like
behavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.

Result: 发现不同评估方法会导致编辑器排名变化，字符串匹配方法存在假阳性问题。

Conclusion: 评估知识编辑方法时需谨慎选择指标和方法，并关注其对模型整体能力的影响。

Abstract: Model editing has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years.
For Knowledge Editing in particular, more challenging evaluation datasets have
recently been released. These datasets use different methodologies to score the
success of editors. Yet, it remains under-explored how robust these
methodologies are and whether they unfairly favor some editors. Moreover, the
disruptive impact of these editors on overall model capabilities remains a
constant blind spot.
  We address both of these problems and show that choosing different metrics
and evaluation methodologies as well as different edit batch sizes can lead to
a different ranking of knowledge editors. Crucially we demonstrate this effect
also on general language understanding tasks evaluated alongside the knowledge
editing tasks. Further we include a manual assessment of the string matching
based evaluation method for knowledge editing that is favored by recently
released datasets, revealing a tendency to produce false positive matches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DAEDCMD的新方法，用于解决持续多模态虚假信息检测中的知识遗忘和环境演化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态虚假信息在社交媒体上广泛传播，现有基于离线数据的方法无法应对新事件的持续出现，导致模型过时且无效。

Method: 通过基于Dirichlet过程的混合专家结构隔离事件特定参数的干扰，并学习连续时间动态模型以预测未来环境分布。

Result: 实验表明，DAEDCMD在六种MMD基线和三种持续学习方法中表现显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: DAEDCMD有效解决了持续多模态虚假信息检测中的两大挑战，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely
spread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control
their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active
topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD
methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in
real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models
trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this
issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,
inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by
two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the
detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,
the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the
generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to
remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific
parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and
anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time
dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and
significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and
three continual learning methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了聊天系统中的自动补全（Ghosting）问题，比较了深度学习和非深度学习方法的性能，并提出了新的动态停止策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ghosting在聊天系统中对用户体验至关重要，但缺乏标准化基准和研究，尤其是在Chat-Ghosting领域。

Method: 使用四种公开对话数据集，比较了trie、n-gram和深度学习方法，并提出了熵基动态停止策略。

Result: 统计n-gram和trie方法在已知前缀上表现更好，而神经模型（如T5和Phi-2）对未知查询更优；对话上下文显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 研究填补了Chat-Ghosting领域的空白，提供了性能分析和新方法，公开了代码和数据。

Abstract: Ghosting, the ability to predict a user's intended text input for inline
query auto-completion, is an invaluable feature for modern search engines and
chat interfaces, greatly enhancing user experience. By suggesting completions
to incomplete queries (or prefixes), ghosting aids users with slow typing
speeds, disabilities, or limited language proficiency. Ghosting is a
challenging problem and has become more important with the ubiquitousness of
chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. Despite the increasing
prominence of chat-based systems utilizing ghosting, this challenging problem
of Chat-Ghosting has received little attention from the NLP/ML research
community. There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and relative performance
analysis of deep learning and non-deep learning methods. We address this
through an open and thorough study of this problem using four publicly
available dialog datasets: two human-human (DailyDialog and DSTC7-Ubuntu) and
two human-bot (Open Assistant and ShareGPT). We experiment with various
existing query auto-completion methods (using tries), n-gram methods and deep
learning methods, with and without dialog context. We also propose a novel
entropy-based dynamic early stopping strategy. Our analysis finds that
statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models in
terms of both model performance and inference efficiency for seen prefixes. For
unseen queries, neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results. Adding
conversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality,
especially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT. We make code and data publicly
available

TL;DR: OpenFActScore是FActScore框架的开源实现，用于评估大语言模型生成文本的事实性，支持任何Hugging Face兼容模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原FActScore依赖闭源商业模型的问题，提供透明、可复现且成本低的评估方案。

Method: 采用Atomic Fact Generation（AFG）提取事实声明，Atomic Fact Validation（AFV）验证事实，支持开源模型。

Result: 开源模型性能接近闭源系统，Gemma表现最佳，与原FActScore实验的Pearson相关性达0.99。

Conclusion: OpenFActScore提升了评估的透明度和可复现性，支持开源模型，降低了成本。

Abstract: We introduce OpenFActScore, an open-source implementation of the FActScore
framework for evaluating the factuality of text generated by large language
models (LLMs). FActScore evaluates the factual accuracy of long-form text by
using Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract individual factual claims and
Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify each claim against a trusted knowledge
source. While the original FActScore relies on closed-source and commercial
models such as InstructGPT and ChatGPT, OpenFActScore enables the use of any
Hugging Face-compatible model for both AFG and AFV. We provide a detailed
technical overview of our implementation, highlighting design choices and
modifications made to support open models. We evaluate multiple open-source
LLMs on both AFG and AFV using the original FActScore benchmark, reporting
BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate relative to human annotations for AFV. Our
results show that open models can approximate the performance of closed-source
systems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and our final setup
obtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments.
OpenFActScore promotes transparency, reproducibility, and cost-effective
evaluation, and is available at: https://github.com/lflage/OpenFActScore.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强调NLP技术实际影响评估的重要性，以促进其更快被采纳和更有用。

Method: 通过对ACL Anthology的结构化调查，分析论文中实际影响评估的现状。

Result: 发现极少论文（约0.1%）包含实际影响评估，且多数评估描述简略。

Conclusion: 呼吁更重视NLP技术的实际影响评估，以提升其应用价值。

Abstract: The ACL community has very little interest in evaluating the real-world
impact of NLP systems. A structured survey of the ACL Anthology shows that
perhaps 0.1% of its papers contain such evaluations; furthermore most papers
which include impact evaluations present them very sketchily and instead focus
on metric evaluations. NLP technology would be more useful and more quickly
adopted if we seriously tried to understand and evaluate its real-world impact.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RabakBench是一个针对新加坡多语言环境的安全基准测试，涵盖Singlish、中文、马来语和泰米尔语，通过三阶段流程构建，评估了11种主流安全分类器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言中大型语言模型（LLMs）及其安全分类器因训练数据和评估基准不足而表现不佳的问题。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：（i）生成对抗性示例；（ii）半自动化多标签安全标注；（iii）高保真翻译。

Result: 构建了包含5,000多个安全标注示例的数据集，评估显示主流分类器性能显著下降。

Conclusion: RabakBench为东南亚多语言环境提供了稳健的安全评估工具，并为低资源环境下的本地化数据集构建提供了可复现框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their safety classifiers often perform
poorly on low-resource languages due to limited training data and evaluation
benchmarks. This paper introduces RabakBench, a new multilingual safety
benchmark localized to Singapore's unique linguistic context, covering
Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. RabakBench is constructed through a
scalable three-stage pipeline: (i) Generate - adversarial example generation by
augmenting real Singlish web content with LLM-driven red teaming; (ii) Label -
semi-automated multi-label safety annotation using majority-voted LLM labelers
aligned with human judgments; and (iii) Translate - high-fidelity translation
preserving linguistic nuance and toxicity across languages. The final dataset
comprises over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six
fine-grained safety categories with severity levels. Evaluations of 11 popular
open-source and closed-source guardrail classifiers reveal significant
performance degradation. RabakBench not only enables robust safety evaluation
in Southeast Asian multilingual settings but also offers a reproducible
framework for building localized safety datasets in low-resource environments.
The benchmark dataset, including the human-verified translations, and
evaluation code are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法中高碳排放和数据泄露的问题。

Method: 1. 多级原则生成：大模型总结任务完成原则；2. 基于原则的实例生成：小模型生成大量数据用于训练。

Result: 显著提升模型性能，同时大幅减少碳排放。

Conclusion: 自进化方法高效且环保，优于直接用小模型生成数据。

Abstract: A common training approach for language models involves using a large-scale
language model to expand a human-provided dataset, which is subsequently used
for model training.This method significantly reduces training costs by
eliminating the need for extensive human data annotation. However, it still
faces challenges such as high carbon emissions during data augmentation and the
risk of data leakage when we use closed-source LLMs. To address these issues,
we propose a self-evolution method for language models. First, we introduce the
Multi-level Principle Generation, which enables a large-scale model to
summarize task-completion principles based on a small amount of task data.
Then, we propose the Principle-based Instance Generation, in which a
smaller-scale language model uses these task principles to generate a large
amount of data. This data is then used for model training. Experimental results
show that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared
to directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data.
Additionally, since we only use the large-scale language model to generate the
task-completion principles, the carbon emissions associated with training the
model are greatly reduced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本或少样本设置中文档级实体和关系抽取中高质量标注数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 结合合成数据生成和基于检索的上下文学习，使用推理优化的语言模型动态检索示例。

Result: 生成了包含5k+维基百科摘要、59k实体和30k关系三元组的合成数据集，并在DocIE共享任务中评估了零样本性能。

Conclusion: 文档级实体和关系抽取对最先进的大语言模型仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Large, high-quality annotated corpora remain scarce in document-level entity
and relation extraction in zero-shot or few-shot settings. In this paper, we
present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and
in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction. In
contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations
or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation
with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language
model. This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without
manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference
time. Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$
Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation
triples. Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE
shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a
zero-shot setting. We find that in-context joint entity and relation extraction
at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large
language models.

Motivation: 复杂任务中的执行失败问题需要有效的恢复机制。

Method: 采用四阶段错误处理框架，结合LLM的推理能力分析环境挑战并制定解决方案。

Result: 在TfD基准测试中表现优异，比无恢复机制基线高11.5%，比现有最强模型高19%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了任务执行的成功率，展示了LLM在失败恢复中的潜力。

Abstract: Embodied agents performing complex tasks are susceptible to execution
failures, motivating the need for effective failure recovery mechanisms. In
this work, we introduce a conditional multistage failure recovery framework
that employs zero-shot chain prompting. The framework is structured into four
error-handling stages, with three operating during task execution and one
functioning as a post-execution reflection phase. Our approach utilises the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to analyse execution challenges within their
environmental context and devise strategic solutions. We evaluate our method on
the TfD benchmark of the TEACH dataset and achieve state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming a baseline without error recovery by 11.5% and
surpassing the strongest existing model by 19%.

Result: 发现数据熵与记忆分数线性相关，随机字符串的熵低于预期，并开发了区分训练与测试数据的方法。

Conclusion: 熵-记忆定律为理解LLMs的记忆机制提供了新视角，并支持数据集推断的应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training
data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In
this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the
domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training
data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models,
we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is
linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of
memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such
sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low
empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same
strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective
approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference
(DI).

direct prompt learning and transfer learning. Direct prompt learning methods
include: general optimization approaches, encoder-based methods, decomposition
strategies, and mixture-of-experts frameworks. Transfer learning methods
consist of: general transfer approaches, encoder-based methods, and

innovations, insights, advantages, and disadvantages, with illustrative
visualizations comparing different frameworks. We identify challenges in
computational efficiency and training stability, and discuss future directions
in improving training robustness and broadening application scope.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像生成系统以英语为中心的问题，减少翻译管道带来的语义漂移、计算开销和文化错位，推动包容性AI研究。

Method: 结合大规模多语言预训练和高分辨率指令调优，训练NeoBabel模型，并扩展两个多语言基准测试（m-GenEval和m-DPG）进行评估。

Result: NeoBabel在多语言基准测试中表现优异（m-GenEval得分0.75，m-DPG得分0.68），同时保持英语能力，模型体积更小（2-4倍）。

Conclusion: 多语言能力不是权衡，而是提升生成AI鲁棒性、效率和文化保真度的催化剂。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly
English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating
digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these
introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We
introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a
new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six
languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is
trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and
high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two
English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG.
NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining
strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG.
Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while
outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though
these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending
crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously
assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably,
NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We
release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated
dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual
evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates
that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved
robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在代码生成中的真实编程能力，揭示其认知与人类专家之间的差异。

Result: LLMs能形成自洽系统，但解决方案缺乏多样性和鲁棒性；结合人类生成内容和模型混合可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LLMs的认知一致性与不一致性为开发更强大的编码模型提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code
generation, yet their true programming competence remains underexplored. We
introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs
across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation,
and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive
programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent
system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and
robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift
between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to
cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study
demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and
diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially
enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal
both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may
facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential
direction for developing more powerful coding models.

Abstract: We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model
(VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies
in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language
Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily
stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively
activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for
additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover
the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal
alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique
indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,
which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.
Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving
from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.
Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B
parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation
successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related
reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and
reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on
multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal
reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM
capabilities.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在批评阶段（评估形式化代码是否准确捕捉原始问题的语义意图）的不足，提升形式化数学推理的可靠性。

Method: 提出CriticLeanGPT（结合监督微调和强化学习训练）和CriticLeanBench基准，构建FineLeanCorpus数据集。

Conclusion: 优化批评阶段对生成可靠形式化至关重要，CriticLean为形式化数学推理的未来发展提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Translating natural language mathematical statements into formal, executable
code is a fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving. While prior work
has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been
paid to the critic phase-the evaluation of whether generated formalizations
truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we
introduce CriticLean, a novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework
that elevates the role of the critic from a passive validator to an active
learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained
via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the
semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench,
a benchmark designed to measure models' ability to distinguish semantically
correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained
CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong open- and
closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct
FineLeanCorpus, a dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich
domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on
human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic
phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations, and we hope our
CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal
mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to Task 1, Subjectivity Detection, of the

transfer-learning and stylistic data augmentation to improve classification of
subjective and objective sentences in English news text. Our approach contrasts
fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders and transfer-learning of fine-tuned
transformer on related tasks. We also introduce a controlled augmentation
pipeline using GPT-4o to generate paraphrases in predefined subjectivity
styles. To ensure label and style consistency, we employ the same model to
correct and refine the generated samples. Results show that transfer-learning
of specified encoders outperforms fine-tuning general-purpose ones, and that
carefully curated augmentation significantly enhances model robustness,
especially in detecting subjective content. Our official submission placed us
$16^{th}$ of 24 participants. Overall, our findings underscore the value of
combining encoder specialization with label-consistent augmentation for
improved subjectivity detection. Our code is available at

tokenization, and (3) their combined influence on classification performance.
Contrary to prior findings in arithmetic reasoning tasks, R2L tokenization does
not boost natural language inference (NLI) of numerical tasks. A longer context
window does also not enhance veracity performance either, highlighting evidence
quality as the dominant bottleneck. Our best-performing system achieves
competitive macro-average F1 score of 0.57 and places us among the Top-4
submissions in Task 3 of CheckThat! 2025. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文综述了潜在推理（latent reasoning）领域，探讨了其在大型语言模型（LLMs）中如何通过隐藏状态进行多步推理，以克服显式链式思维（CoT）的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式链式思维（CoT）虽然提高了模型的可解释性和准确性，但其依赖自然语言推理限制了模型的表达能力。潜在推理通过完全在隐藏状态中进行推理，解决了这一瓶颈。

Method: 论文首先分析了神经网络层作为推理计算基础的作用，探讨了分层表示如何支持复杂转换。随后研究了多种潜在推理方法，包括基于激活的递归、隐藏状态传播和微调策略。

Result: 论文总结了潜在推理的先进范式，如通过掩码扩散模型实现无限深度推理，从而实现全局一致且可逆的推理过程。

Conclusion: 通过统一这些视角，论文旨在澄清潜在推理的概念框架，并为LLM认知前沿研究指明未来方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both
interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning
limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this
bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's
continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent
reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role
of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,
highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.
Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including
activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning
strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we
discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked
diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning
processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual
landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the
frontier of LLM cognition. An associated GitHub repository collecting the
latest papers and repos is available at:

### [97] [Efficiency-Effectiveness Reranking FLOPs for LLM-based Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06223)
*Zhiyuan Peng,Ting-ruen Wei,Tingyu Song,Yilun Zhao,Yi Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估指标E²R-FLOPs，用于衡量基于大语言模型（LLM）的重新排序任务的效率与效果权衡，解决了现有代理指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM重新排序效率的代理指标（如延迟、前向传递次数等）依赖于硬件和运行时选择，且未考虑模型规模，难以解释效率与效果的权衡。

Method: 提出E²R-FLOPs指标（RPP和QPP），并构建了一个可解释的FLOPs估计器，用于硬件无关的效率和效果评估。

Result: 通过广泛实验评估了不同架构的LLM重新排序器，揭示了效率与效果的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 新指标为研究社区提供了更清晰的效率评估工具，并呼吁关注效率与效果的平衡问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in
information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high
computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies
evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as
latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens.
However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg
parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size,
making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the
efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose
E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per
PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for
hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable
FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even
without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct
comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with
different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and
bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent KB是一个分层经验框架，通过Reason-Retrieve-Refine流程解决语言代理在跨领域任务中的错误修正和经验复用问题，显著提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言代理在处理复杂任务时难以有效修正错误和复用跨领域经验，传统代理无法从彼此经验中学习。

Method: 引入Agent KB框架，通过捕获高层策略和详细执行日志，构建共享知识库，实现跨代理知识迁移。

Result: 在GAIA基准测试中，Agent KB将成功率提升高达16.28个百分点；在SWE-bench代码修复任务中，Claude-3成功率从41.33%提升至53.33%。

Conclusion: Agent KB为代理提供了模块化、框架无关的基础设施，使其能从过去经验中学习并将成功策略泛化至新任务。

Abstract: As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with
effective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce
Agent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic
problem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses
a core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's
experiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution
logs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent
knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success
rates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3
improves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on
intermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to
improve from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a
modular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from
past experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.

*Nicholas Merchant,Haitz Sáez de Ocáriz Borde,Andrei Cristian Popescu,Carlos Garcia Jurado Suarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过结构化标注改进生成模型的提示对齐，提出Re-LAION-Caption 19M数据集，实验证明结构化标注显著提升文本-图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型因数据噪声大，提示对齐效果差，用户需依赖提示工程。

Method: 使用四部分模板（主题、场景、美学、相机细节）生成结构化标注，基于Re-LAION-5B构建高质量数据集Re-LAION-Caption 19M，并微调PixArt-Σ和Stable Diffusion 2。

Result: 结构化标注版本在VQA模型中表现更优，文本-图像对齐得分更高。

Conclusion: 结构化标注可显著提升生成模型的可控性和对齐效果。

Abstract: We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt
adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like
LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit
desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption
structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and
alignment. We introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality subset of
Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by
a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part
template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune
PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly
shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher
text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models. The
dataset is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CorrDetail的视觉细节增强自校正框架，用于可解释的人脸伪造检测，解决了现有方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的快速发展，面部深度伪造对安全领域构成重大挑战，亟需有效的检测方法。现有方法存在解释性不足或易产生幻觉的问题。

Method: 设计了CorrDetail框架，通过错误引导问题校正真实伪造细节，并引入视觉细粒度细节增强模块和融合决策策略。

Result: 实验表明，CorrDetail在性能上优于最新方法，能准确识别伪造细节，并具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CorrDetail为解决深度伪造检测中的解释性和可靠性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: With the swift progression of image generation technology, the widespread
emergence of facial deepfakes poses significant challenges to the field of
security, thus amplifying the urgent need for effective deepfake
detection.Existing techniques for face forgery detection can broadly be
categorized into two primary groups: visual-based methods and multimodal
approaches. The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details,
while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone
to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a
visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for
interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to
rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning,
with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than
yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of
its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated,
supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a
fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's
discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of
visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results
demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying
forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 解决在几何复杂的道路（如S型弯道）上，传统RGB摄像头方法在行人检测中的局限性。

Method: 引入YOLO-APD架构，整合SimAM注意力机制、C3Ghost模块、SimSPPF模块、Mish激活函数和IGD模块，并利用车辆转向动态进行自适应感兴趣区域处理。

Result: 在CARLA数据集上达到77.7% mAP@0.5:0.95和96%以上的行人召回率，实时处理速度为100 FPS，优于YOLOv8等基线模型。

Conclusion: YOLO-APD为复杂驾驶环境提供了高精度、高效且适应性强的感知系统，提升了自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception systems require robust pedestrian detection,
particularly on geometrically complex roadways like Type-S curved surfaces,
where standard RGB camera-based methods face limitations. This paper introduces
YOLO-APD, a novel deep learning architecture enhancing the YOLOv8 framework
specifically for this challenge. YOLO-APD integrates several key architectural
modifications: a parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism, computationally
efficient C3Ghost modules, a novel SimSPPF module for enhanced multi-scale
feature pooling, the Mish activation function for improved optimization, and an
Intelligent Gather & Distribute (IGD) module for superior feature fusion in the
network's neck. The concept of leveraging vehicle steering dynamics for
adaptive region-of-interest processing is also presented. Comprehensive
evaluations on a custom CARLA dataset simulating complex scenarios demonstrate
that YOLO-APD achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, reaching 77.7%
mAP@0.5:0.95 and exceptional pedestrian recall exceeding 96%, significantly
outperforming baseline models, including YOLOv8. Furthermore, it maintains
real-time processing capabilities at 100 FPS, showcasing a superior balance
between accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies validate the synergistic
contribution of each integrated component. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset
confirms the architecture's potential while highlighting the need for domain
adaptation. This research advances the development of highly accurate,
efficient, and adaptable perception systems based on cost-effective sensors,
contributing to enhanced safety and reliability for autonomous navigation in
challenging, less-structured driving environments.

TL;DR: Spotlight是一种虚拟染色方法，通过引导模型关注相关细胞结构，结合直方图前景估计和Dice损失，改善了形态学表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟染色方法通常对所有像素平等处理，导致背景噪声和伪影被复制，而非聚焦于生物学意义信号。

Method: Spotlight使用直方图前景估计掩蔽像素损失，并在软阈值预测上计算Dice损失，实现形状感知学习。

Result: 在3D基准数据集上，Spotlight改善了形态学表示，同时保持了像素级精度，更适合下游任务。

Conclusion: Spotlight提供了一种简单而强大的虚拟染色方法，优化了生物信号的表现。

Abstract: Microscopy enables direct observation of cellular morphology in 3D, with
transmitted-light methods offering low-cost, minimally invasive imaging and
fluorescence microscopy providing specificity and contrast. Virtual staining
combines these strengths by using machine learning to predict fluorescence
images from label-free inputs. However, training of existing methods typically
relies on loss functions that treat all pixels equally, thus reproducing
background noise and artifacts instead of focusing on biologically meaningful
signals. We introduce Spotlight, a simple yet powerful virtual staining
approach that guides the model to focus on relevant cellular structures.
Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss
and to calculate a Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware
learning. Applied to a 3D benchmark dataset, Spotlight improves morphological
representation while preserving pixel-level accuracy, resulting in virtual
stains better suited for downstream tasks such as segmentation and profiling.

quantitatively evaluate existing foundational models to assess their
effectivity for a representative set of agricultural tasks. From an
agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an
ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). We then survey and compare
existing general-purpose foundational models in this framework and empirically
evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific
tasks. Finally, we highlight the need for a dedicated foundational model
tailored specifically to agriculture.

Conclusion: 结合人类主观评估的深度学习模型能有效提升水下图像质量，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, particularly neural networks, have
significantly impacted a wide range of fields, including the automatic
enhancement of underwater images. This paper presents a deep learning-based
approach to improving underwater image quality by integrating human subjective
assessments into the training process. To this end, we utilize publicly
available datasets containing underwater images labeled by experts as either
high or low quality. Our method involves first training a classifier network to
distinguish between high- and low-quality images. Subsequently, generative
adversarial networks (GANs) are trained using various enhancement criteria to
refine the low-quality images. The performance of the GAN models is evaluated
using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM, as well as through
qualitative analysis. Results demonstrate that the proposed model --
particularly when incorporating criteria such as color fidelity and image
sharpness -- achieves substantial improvements in both perceived and measured
image quality.

Result: 在11个数据集上实验表明，pFedMMA在个性化和泛化之间取得了最佳平衡，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: pFedMMA为视觉语言任务的联邦学习提供了一种高效、个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to
decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has
emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated
learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of
personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this
work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework
that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter
contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally
shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization
strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions
while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global
generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared
component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across
eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that
pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and
generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods. The code

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像编辑依赖手动提示，对运动或语言能力受限的用户不友好，因此提出基于神经信号的解决方案。

Method: 结合CS3模块和DGF模块处理多模态信号，通过扩散变换器（DiT）对齐编辑语义，并使用对比学习预训练编码器。

Result: LoongX性能接近文本驱动方法（CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558），且在结合语音时表现更优（CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549）。

Conclusion: 神经驱动生成模型为无障碍图像编辑提供了新方向，支持认知驱动的创意技术发展。

Abstract: Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it
labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or
language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing
approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes
state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928
image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography
(EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography
(PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address
the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The
cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific
features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these
features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics
via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train
the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic
intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I:
0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural
signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results
highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling
accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for
cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to
support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.

Abstract: Many 3D scene editing tasks focus on modifying local regions rather than the
entire scene, except for some global applications like style transfer, and in
the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), where scenes are represented by a
series of Gaussians, this structure allows for precise regional edits, offering
enhanced control over specific areas of the scene; however, the challenge lies
in the fact that 3D semantic parsing often underperforms compared to its 2D
counterpart, making targeted manipulations within 3D spaces more difficult and
limiting the fidelity of edits, which we address by leveraging 2D diffusion
editing to accurately identify modification regions in each view, followed by
inverse rendering for 3D localization, then refining the frontal view and
initializing a coarse 3DGS with consistent views and approximate shapes derived
from depth maps predicted by a 2D foundation model, thereby supporting an
iterative, view-consistent editing process that gradually enhances structural
details and textures to ensure coherence across perspectives. Experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering up to a $4\times$ speedup, providing a more efficient and effective
approach to 3D scene local editing.

Conclusion: OpenWorldSAM通过高效设计和多模态嵌入，实现了开放词汇场景下的高性能分割，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a
critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise
spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present
OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model
v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings
extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is
guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a
diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language
descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks.
ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we
train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving
remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's
spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and
cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances.
iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities,
generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts
without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic,
instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including
ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.

Abstract: Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes
to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of
herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision
guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed
presence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation
in real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep
learning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,
and uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated
nozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted
using 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to
simulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean
average precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close
to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision
of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water
sensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones
where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22%
for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies,
respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based
on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining
real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide
application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to
include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus
tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed
by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn
production systems.

Motivation: 当前诊断认知衰退（如阿尔茨海默病和轻度认知障碍）的方法耗时且昂贵，导致许多病例未被及时发现。通过分析真实驾驶行为，提取与认知衰退相关的“数字指纹”，为早期检测提供新途径。

Method: 结合大视觉模型和自然驾驶视频，分析驾驶员行为，分类认知状态并预测疾病进展。

Result: 方法能够识别功能衰退的早期预警信号，支持主动干预策略的开发。

Conclusion: 该研究为早期检测认知衰退提供了可扩展、非侵入性的监测系统，有助于减轻老龄化社会中认知衰退带来的负担。

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers
from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times,
cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly
nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior
captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital
fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of
MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights
from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive
decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic
driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and
predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between
real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status
of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our
method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to
proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and
supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to
mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the
aging population.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于尺度不变噪声的扩散模型（Cloud Diffusion Model），用于改进图像生成的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型使用白噪声，而自然图像具有尺度不变的统计特性，因此提出使用尺度不变噪声以更好地匹配自然图像的特性。

Method: 提出用尺度不变噪声替代白噪声，构建Cloud Diffusion Model，强调大尺度相关性并弱化小尺度相关性。

Result: 预计该模型能实现更快的推理速度、更高频的细节表现和更强的可控性。

Conclusion: Cloud Diffusion Model有望超越传统白噪声扩散模型，后续将进行实验验证。

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise
to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise.
The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based
on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is
independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type
of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by
a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable
sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale
correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant
noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white
noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these
models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and
greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud
Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare
it to classic, white noise diffusion models.

*Giulio Federico,Fabio Carrara,Claudio Gennaro,Giuseppe Amato,Marco Di Benedetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoomNet是一种新型多视图扩散架构，通过并行应用同一扩散模型生成一致的多视图图像，解决了单图像生成多视图时的空间一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像生成多视图时缺乏空间一致性会降低3D网格质量，需要一种新方法来提高视图一致性和重建质量。

Method: LoomNet通过多视图并行扩散模型构建共享潜在空间，将各视图编码投影到三个正交平面并融合，最终生成一致的多视图图像。

Result: LoomNet在15秒内生成16个高质量且一致的多视图图像，在图像质量和重建指标上优于现有方法，并能生成多样化的新视图。

Conclusion: LoomNet通过共享潜在空间和视图融合技术，显著提高了多视图生成的一致性和质量，为3D重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating consistent multi-view images from a single image remains
challenging. Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in
surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view
diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same
diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and
leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific
inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel
view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes.
For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated
plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and
interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent
interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent
multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just
15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
both image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by
producing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.

Conclusion: 模型在多模态检索中表现优异，但需权衡存储与效率。

Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for retrieval systems that operate across
modalities, we introduce llama-nemoretriever-colembed, a unified text-image
retrieval model that delivers state-of-the-art performance across multiple
benchmarks. We release two model variants, 1B and 3B. The 3B model achieves
state of the art performance, scoring NDCG@5 91.0 on ViDoRe V1 and 63.5 on
ViDoRe V2, placing first on both leaderboards as of June 27, 2025.
  Our approach leverages the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model (VLM),
modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional
attention, and integrates a ColBERT-style late interaction mechanism to enable
fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this
mechanism delivers superior retrieval accuracy, it introduces trade-offs in
storage and efficiency. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these
trade-offs. Additionally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the
model's retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: The scarcity of autonomous vehicle datasets from developing regions,

tailored to challenging African driving scenarios. Our refractive module
simulates optical effects from low-quality lenses and air turbulence, including
lens distortion, Perlin noise, Thin-Plate Spline (TPS), and divergence-free

fog, and lens flare. To establish a benchmark, we provide baseline performance
using three image restoration models. To support perception research in
underrepresented African contexts, without costly data collection, labeling, or
simulation, we release our distortion toolkit, augmented dataset splits, and
benchmark results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的布局生成方法未能充分理解视觉主题与设计元素间的空间关系，导致生成布局结构不合理且缺乏多样性。

Method: 引入明确的关系定义（如区域、显著性和边距），将布局分解为结构化子布局；提出布局原型重平衡采样器，量化布局风格。

Result: 实验表明，ReLayout在生成结构化和多样化布局方面优于基线方法，更符合人类审美且更具解释性。

Conclusion: ReLayout通过关系定义和原型重平衡，显著提升了布局生成的质量和多样性。

Abstract: Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given
canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has
been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts
automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based
methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes
and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout
generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that
leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent
layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we
enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such
as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing
the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling
the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined
relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines
layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct
layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that
arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive
experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can
generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human
aesthetics and more explainable.

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨模态转换引导网络（CTNet），用于解决多模态人脸反欺诈（FAS）任务中的分布差异和模态缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态FAS中，不同模态数据分布差异大且模态可能缺失，而活体样本的特征转换更一致。

Method: 学习活体样本的跨模态特征一致性，并利用不一致性检测OOD攻击；通过RGB模态补充缺失的IR和深度特征。

Result: CTNet在多数协议下优于现有的多模态FAS方法。

Conclusion: CTNet通过跨模态特征转换和模态补充，有效提升了多模态FAS的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to detect genuine human presence by
extracting discriminative liveness cues from multiple modalities, such as RGB,
infrared (IR), and depth images, to enhance the robustness of biometric
authentication systems. However, because data from different modalities are
typically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental
conditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution
discrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.
Furthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater
challenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this
paper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to
tackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from
that, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are
typically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature
transitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared
to those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose
learning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to
construct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the
inconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to
effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To
further address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning
complementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as
auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet
outperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

Motivation: 传统工业质检中的缺陷检测方法效率低、成本高且鲁棒性差，亟需一种高精度且依赖少量标注数据的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段协作训练机制，结合条件扩散模型生成多尺度伪缺陷样本，并利用CLIP跨模态特征过滤噪声标签。

Result: 在NEU-DET数据集上，DSYM在相同标注数据量下达到78.4% mAP@0.5，仅需40%标注数据时仍保持75.1% mAP@0.5。

Conclusion: DSYM为工业质检提供了一种高精度、低标注依赖的缺陷检测方案，具有显著的数据效率优势。

Abstract: In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a
critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors
such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional
methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms,
suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper
introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional
diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a
staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for
initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the
generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes
multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise
filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the
NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled
data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the
labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant
advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision,
low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality
inspection scenarios. The work of this article has been open-sourced at

Motivation: 现有基于卷积网络的视频表示方法解码速度慢且训练时间长，GSVR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出混合变形场（结合三平面运动和多项式运动）、动态感知时间切片策略和量化感知微调，以优化视频表示。

Result: 在Bunny和UVG数据集上，GSVR解码速度达800+ FPS，训练时间仅2秒/帧，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GSVR在视频插值和压缩任务中表现优异，解码速度和训练效率显著提升。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for video have been recognized as a novel and
promising form of video representation. Existing works pay more attention to
improving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding
speed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing
methods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video
representation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds
per frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose
GSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS
and 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.
Specifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of
the video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and
the polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object
motion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing
strategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)
based on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion
and non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to
avoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to
compress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the
Bunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than
existing methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other
methods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task
to SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.

TL;DR: Accordion是一个将AI生成的平面设计转换为可编辑的分层设计的框架，同时通过用户提示优化无意义的AI生成文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成的平面设计缺乏可编辑性，而分层设计需要专业知识。Accordion旨在解决这一问题，将非分层设计转化为可编辑的分层设计。

Method: Accordion采用自上而下的方法，利用视觉语言模型（VLM）在三个阶段执行不同任务，并结合SAM等视觉专家工具。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，Accordion在DesignIntention基准测试中表现优异，能生成高质量的设计变体。

Conclusion: Accordion成功地将AI生成的设计转化为可编辑的分层设计，并通过用户提示优化文本，为设计师提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Graphic design is crucial for conveying ideas and messages. Designers usually
organize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to
simplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With
the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in
pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack
editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers,
influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the
creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose
Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to
convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining
nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user
prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct
roles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the
VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods
(e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered
designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually
harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer.
Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element
removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our

*Yuyang Hu,Kangfu Mei,Mojtaba Sahraee-Ardakan,Ulugbek S. Kamilov,Peyman Milanfar,Mauricio Delbracio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kernel Density Steering (KDS) 是一种新的推理时间框架，通过显式局部模式搜索提升扩散模型的图像恢复质量，减少伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像恢复中存在不一致的保真度和伪影问题，KDS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: KDS使用N粒子扩散样本集合，通过局部核密度估计梯度将样本引导至共享的高密度区域，避免伪影。

Result: KDS显著提升了超分辨率和图像修复任务的定量和定性性能。

Conclusion: KDS作为一种即插即用框架，无需重新训练即可提升扩散模型的输出质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for image restoration, but existing methods
often struggle with inconsistent fidelity and undesirable artifacts. To address
this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time
framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local
mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples,
computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective
outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared,
higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local
mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from
spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model
imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows
us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by
simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS
requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with
various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS
substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on
challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GenHMC的生成方法，利用未配对的HMC数据生成高质量合成图像，解决了VR/AR中真实感头像动画的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于难以获取面部真实状态，且现有方法依赖昂贵的配对数据采集，限制了大规模数据集的应用。

Method: GenHMC利用未配对的HMC数据，直接生成合成HMC图像，解耦面部表情和外观。

Result: 方法能够准确解耦输入信号，生成高质量图像，并推广到未见过的身份，提高数据效率和准确性。

Conclusion: GenHMC为VR/AR头像动画提供了更高效、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality
(VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground
truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images
from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations
in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full
observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on
analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer
from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their
personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome)
for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale
datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In
this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),
that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,
to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning
avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly
disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and
viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.
Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the
reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both
evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these
new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and
state-of-the-art accuracy.

Motivation: 现有方法在领域特定图像生成中存在语义理解与视觉表示分离、语义约束不足的问题，导致生成结果出现幻觉和语义偏差。

Method: 提出AdaptaGen框架，包括矩阵提示优化、多视角理解、跨模态适应机制和两阶段标题语义转换。

Conclusion: AdaptaGen通过分层语义优化和跨模态适应，有效解决了领域特定图像生成中的核心问题。

Abstract: Domain-specific image generation aims to produce high-quality visual content
for specialized fields while ensuring semantic accuracy and detail fidelity.
However, existing methods exhibit two critical limitations: First, current
approaches address prompt engineering and model adaptation separately,
overlooking the inherent dependence between semantic understanding and visual
representation in specialized domains. Second, these techniques inadequately
incorporate domain-specific semantic constraints during content synthesis,
resulting in generation outcomes that exhibit hallucinations and semantic
deviations. To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical
semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt
optimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive
semantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate
hallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation
mechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables
preserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across
images. Additionally, we introduce a two-phase caption semantic transformation
during the generation phase. This approach maintains semantic coherence while
enhancing visual diversity, ensuring the generated images adhere to
domain-specific constraints. Experimental results confirm our approach's
effectiveness, with our framework achieving superior performance across 40
categories from diverse datasets using only 16 images per category,
demonstrating significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and
semantic consistency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于焦点映射的特征提取方法（OFFSET），用于解决组合图像检索（CIR）中的视觉数据不均匀性和文本数据优先级问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合图像检索（CIR）能够灵活表达用户复杂需求，但现有方法忽略了视觉数据中主导与噪声部分的不均匀性，以及文本数据在图像修改过程中的优先级，导致查询特征退化和视觉焦点偏差。

Method: 提出了一种焦点映射特征提取器，包含主导部分分割和双重焦点映射模块，以减少噪声干扰；并设计了文本引导的焦点修正模块，利用文本修改需求自适应调整参考图像的焦点。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验验证了所提方法（OFFSET）的优越性。

Conclusion: OFFSET通过主导部分分割和文本引导的焦点修正，有效提升了组合图像检索的性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is
capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It
enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a
modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding
the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its
nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and
noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation,
and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is
overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two
limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which
consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping.
It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide
the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact
of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus
revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the
text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby
enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features.
The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus
shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method. The
codes and data are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/OFFSET.github.io/

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在边缘细节保留和区域同质性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升了PolSAR图像分类的精度，尤其在复杂地形中表现优异。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various
domains due to their ability to model and generate complicated data
distributions. However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued
diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase
information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural
details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform,
which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited
for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion
model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically,
the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into
low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and
boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then
designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components.
During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is
utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation.
Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are
jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results
on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and
maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.

Result: 实验表明DRA在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，显著提升了新类别的性能。

Conclusion: DRA通过动态特征重要性分配有效提升了模型的泛化能力，尤其在处理新类别时表现突出。

Abstract: Pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP demonstrate
impressive generalization ability. Existing prompt-based and adapter-based
works have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the
challenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards
unseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating
all tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting
on less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and
degrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept
recognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a
novel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class
generalization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the
importance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first
employs token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and
group tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to
the importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature
ranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response
mechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels
identified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1
regularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA
over existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on
various benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and
domain generalization. The source code will be published after the paper is
received.

Result: 与传统方法相比，提高了脑损伤分割和表征的准确性，为临床和研究提供了可靠工具。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效逆转脑损伤过程，为脑损伤分析提供了新方法。

Abstract: Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often
detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural
changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes
areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain
tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the
importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing
lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as
a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework
for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first
segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue
deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating
the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the
core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain.
This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is
well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results
demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and
brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for
clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion
healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for
validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize
multiple lesioned brain images.

Abstract: Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by
advances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI
automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse
platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large
and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant
information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches
typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives,
which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established
object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these
issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages
zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an
IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU
predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object
detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13%
across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and
AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy
improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in
open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely
underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical
training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity
but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce
unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due
to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical

large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It
comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios,
providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation
models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading
performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across
multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our

Result: 在基类到新类泛化、跨数据集评估和领域泛化三个广泛使用的设置中，ISP表现出色。

Conclusion: ISP通过结构关系和动态损失调整，显著提升了VLM的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream
tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide
text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works
ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within
and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new
classes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an
Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of
information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces
self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural
relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across
modalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving
feature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that
dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing
the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization
ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings:
base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization
demonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验表明LiON-LoRA在轨迹控制精度和运动强度调整上优于现有方法，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: LiON-LoRA为视频扩散模型提供了更稳定和精确的控制方法。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although
vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal
movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over
both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the
unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose
LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core
principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we
analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling
decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced
across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.
Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)
to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a
modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we
extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,
unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that
LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy
and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal
training data. Project Page: https://fuchengsu.github.io/lionlora.github.io/

Abstract: Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations,
such as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose
estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling
solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting
conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,
blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic
or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,
event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced
signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work
addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion
approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to
achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique
was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to
achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The
pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme
conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the
proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of
RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under
a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the
dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further
supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. To support
community research on this topic, our dataset will be released publicly.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional datasets consisting of hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling detailed material and surface analysis.
Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying

various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models,
representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep
learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets
using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to
analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths,
limitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep
learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical

TL;DR: SenseShift6D是一个新的RGB-D数据集，用于研究6D物体姿态估计在真实世界光照和传感器变化下的性能，并探索测试时传感器控制的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集在固定光照和传感器设置下表现良好，但忽略了真实世界中的变化。SenseShift6D填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过物理调整13种RGB曝光、9种RGB增益、自动曝光、4种深度捕捉模式和5种光照水平，生成了包含101.9k RGB和10k深度图像的数据集。

Result: 实验表明，测试时传感器控制比数字数据增强更能提升性能，且多模态RGB-D配置的联合调整效果最佳。

Conclusion: SenseShift6D为自适应感知系统提供了基础，扩展了6D姿态估计的评估范式。

Abstract: Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on
representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these
datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving
the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or
depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate
such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,
9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.
For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire
101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting
permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our
dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater
performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance
comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data
quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is
effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even
greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显微镜操作中获取色彩准确且平衡的图像具有挑战性，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 开发了一种自动白平衡算法，并在200张显微镜图像上进行了实验验证，涵盖病理学常用样本。

Result: 该算法在HPS染色和免疫组化染色图像上表现优于传统数字摄影白平衡算法。

Conclusion: 自动白平衡算法在显微镜图像处理中具有更高的有效性。

Abstract: The acquisition of accurately coloured, balanced images in an optical
microscope can be a challenge even for experienced microscope operators. This
article presents an entirely automatic mechanism for balancing the white level
that allows the correction of the microscopic colour images adequately. The
results of the algorithm have been confirmed experimentally on a set of two
hundred microscopic images. The images contained scans of three microscopic
specimens commonly used in pathomorphology. Also, the results achieved were
compared with other commonly used white balance algorithms in digital
photography. The algorithm applied in this work is more effective than the
classical algorithms used in colour photography for microscopic images stained
with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron and for immunohistochemical staining images.

Abstract: Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial
yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR.
Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture,
neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural
reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense
multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we
introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,
interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a
three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D
object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D
segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video
diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable
part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by
occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by
a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to
ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results
demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated
objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and
plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated
asset generation. Our project page is available at

Abstract: Virtual try-on has made significant progress in recent years. This paper
addresses how to achieve multifunctional virtual try-on guided solely by text
instructions, including full outfit change and local editing. Previous methods
primarily relied on end-to-end networks to perform single try-on tasks, lacking
versatility and flexibility. We propose TalkFashion, an intelligent try-on
assistant that leverages the powerful comprehension capabilities of large
language models to analyze user instructions and determine which task to
execute, thereby activating different processing pipelines accordingly.
Additionally, we introduce an instruction-based local repainting model that
eliminates the need for users to manually provide masks. With the help of
multi-modal models, this approach achieves fully automated local editings,
enhancing the flexibility of editing tasks. The experimental results
demonstrate better semantic consistency and visual quality compared to the
current methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPADE框架通过空间感知去噪网络改进开放词汇全景场景图生成，解决了视觉语言模型在空间关系推理中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在开放词汇设置下依赖预训练视觉语言模型，但忽视了其在空间关系推理中的不足，导致关系预测不理想。

Method: SPADE框架包括两步：基于反演引导的UNet校准和空间感知上下文推理，结合轻量级LoRA微调和空间感知关系图变换器。

Result: 在PSG和Visual Genome数据集上，SPADE在封闭和开放场景中均优于现有方法，尤其在空间关系预测上表现突出。

Conclusion: SPADE通过空间感知设计显著提升了全景场景图生成的性能，特别是在空间关系推理方面。

Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with
relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in
complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the
open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs
in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object
relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated
by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial
structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork)
framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two
key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2)
spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general
pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with
cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based
fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation
graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual
information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.
Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate
that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set
scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.

Abstract: Document reconstruction constitutes a significant facet of document analysis
and recognition, a field that has been progressively accruing interest within
the scholarly community. A multitude of these researchers employ an array of
document understanding models to generate predictions on distinct subtasks,
subsequently integrating their results into a holistic document reconstruction
format via heuristic principles. Nevertheless, these multi-stage methodologies
are hindered by the phenomenon of error propagation, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Furthermore, contemporary studies utilize generative models to
extract the logical sequence of plain text, tables and mathematical expressions
in an end-to-end process. However, this approach is deficient in preserving the
information related to element layouts, which are vital for document
reconstruction. To surmount these aforementioned limitations, we in this paper
present an innovative autoregressive model specifically designed for document
reconstruction, referred to as Document Reconstruction via End-to-end
Autoregressive Model (DREAM). DREAM transmutes the text image into a sequence
of document reconstruction in a comprehensive, end-to-end process,
encapsulating a broader spectrum of document element information. In addition,
we establish a standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, and
introduce a novel Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset for
assessing the performance of the task. Empirical results substantiate that our
methodology attains unparalleled performance in the realm of document
reconstruction. Furthermore, the results on a variety of subtasks, encompassing
document layout analysis, text recognition, table structure recognition,
formula recognition and reading order detection, indicate that our model is
competitive and compatible with various tasks.

Method: 使用太阳高度角作为全局条件变量，结合定制归一化方法，生成合成数据。

Result: 该方法能准确捕捉光照特性和图像噪声。

Conclusion: 太阳高度角是一种高效且无需大量标注的条件变量，适用于合成数据生成。

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily
dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data
acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors
such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage.
Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic
camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime
variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently,
we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily
computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the
need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored
normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small
numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture
lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context
of diffusion models.

Abstract: As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges
from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods
suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new
data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the
incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and
scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization
in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework
for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring
component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal
vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and
physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training
of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate
that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic
segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance
on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for
the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications
for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能和一致性上优于现有方法，能更好地保持对象身份。

Conclusion: “2D-3D-2D”框架为2D图像编辑提供了更一致和物理可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have achieved significant progress in advancing 2D image
editing, demonstrating exceptional precision and realism. However, they often
struggle with consistency and object identity preservation due to their
inherent pixel-manipulation nature. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel "2D-3D-2D" framework. Our approach begins by lifting 2D objects into 3D
representation, enabling edits within a physically plausible,
rigidity-constrained 3D environment. The edited 3D objects are then reprojected
and seamlessly inpainted back into the original 2D image. In contrast to
existing 2D editing methods, such as DragGAN and DragDiffusion, our method
directly manipulates objects in a 3D environment. Extensive experiments
highlight that our framework surpasses previous methods in general performance,
delivering highly consistent edits while robustly preserving object identity.

Result: 模型在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，并展示出零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作将机器感知从简单识别推向认知理解，为更智能的AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening
but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future
prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge.
To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically
fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with
a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our
key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the
Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric
visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables
the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual
evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with
large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted
instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced
reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks.
Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning
tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of
each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine
perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding,
paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics,
human-computer interaction, and beyond.

Conclusion: I²R方法通过改进特征匹配和抑制误匹配，显著提升了小样本语义分割的性能。

Abstract: The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation has driven significant
interest in few-shot segmentation, which aims to develop segmentation models
capable of generalizing rapidly to novel classes using minimal exemplars.
Conventional training paradigms typically generate query prior maps by
extracting masked-area features from support images, followed by making
predictions guided by these prior maps. However, current approaches remain
constrained by two critical limitations stemming from inter- and intra-image
discrepancies, both of which significantly degrade segmentation performance: 1)
The semantic gap between support and query images results in mismatched
features and inaccurate prior maps; 2) Visually similar yet semantically
distinct regions within support or query images lead to false negative or false
positive predictions. We propose a novel FSS method called \textbf{I$^2$R}: 1)
Using category-specific high level representations which aggregate global
semantic cues from support and query images, enabling more precise inter-image
region localization and address the first limitation. 2) Directional masking
strategy that suppresses inconsistent support-query pixel pairs, which exhibit
high feature similarity but conflicting mask, to mitigate the second issue.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving improvements of 1.9\% and 2.1\% in mIoU under the 1-shot
setting on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ benchmarks, respectively.

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在IoD和Pearson-R等临床指标上表现优异，具有更好的临床相关性。

Conclusion: USIGAN通过全局语义提取和优化传输机制，显著提升了IHC虚拟染色的内容一致性和病理语义一致性，为病理分析提供了高效且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) virtual staining is a task that generates virtual
IHC images from H\&E images while maintaining pathological semantic consistency
with adjacent slices. This task aims to achieve cross-domain mapping between
morphological structures and staining patterns through generative models,
providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for pathological analysis.
However, under weakly paired conditions, spatial heterogeneity between adjacent
slices presents significant challenges. This can lead to inaccurate one-to-many
mappings and generate results that are inconsistent with the pathological
semantics of adjacent slices. To address this issue, we propose a novel
unbalanced self-information feature transport for IHC virtual staining, named
USIGAN, which extracts global morphological semantics without relying on
positional correspondence.By removing weakly paired terms in the joint marginal
distribution, we effectively mitigate the impact of weak pairing on joint
distributions, thereby significantly improving the content consistency and
pathological semantic consistency of the generated results. Moreover, we design
the Unbalanced Optimal Transport Consistency (UOT-CTM) mechanism and the
Pathology Self-Correspondence (PC-SCM) mechanism to construct correlation
matrices between H\&E and generated IHC in image-level and real IHC and
generated IHC image sets in intra-group level.. Experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance across multiple clinically significant metrics, such as IoD and
Pearson-R correlation, demonstrating better clinical relevance.

Result: 在MODIS和Sentinel-2数据集上的实验表明，DFYP在RMSE、MAE和R2指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DFYP在多样农业场景中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于实际农业监测。

Abstract: Accurate remote sensing-based crop yield prediction remains a fundamental
challenging task due to complex spatial patterns, heterogeneous spectral
characteristics, and dynamic agricultural conditions. Existing methods often
suffer from limited spatial modeling capacity, weak generalization across crop
types and years. To address these challenges, we propose DFYP, a novel Dynamic
Fusion framework for crop Yield Prediction, which combines spectral channel
attention, edge-adaptive spatial modeling and a learnable fusion mechanism to
improve robustness across diverse agricultural scenarios. Specifically, DFYP
introduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA)
module that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input
channels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator
Learning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional
kernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop
and temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable
fusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global
contextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop
generalization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and
multi-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different
spatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness
and robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring.

Conclusion: D-FCGS为动态3DGS的前馈压缩提供了新思路，推动了FVV的可扩展传输与存储。

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive 3D experiences, but efficient
compression of dynamic 3D representations remains a major challenge. Recent
advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have
enabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple
scene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits
generalizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic
Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing
temporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a
Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame
motions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors
are compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model
that combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate
estimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion
compensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent
fidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS
generalizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that
it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods,
achieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual
quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression for
dynamic 3DGS, paving the way for scalable FVV transmission and storage in
immersive applications.

Motivation: 现有遥感视觉语言模型（RS-VLMs）在像素级任务和小目标识别上表现不佳，且计算资源消耗高，限制了实际应用。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，GeoMag在像素级任务上表现优异，同时在其他粒度任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GeoMag通过动态注意力机制和分辨率优化，显著提升了遥感图像理解的效率和性能。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) image
understanding has achieved notable progress, demonstrating the basic ability to
recognize and describe geographical entities. However, existing RS-VLMs are
mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to
handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition
scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when
processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical
applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an
end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically
focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform
remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method
introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and
Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the
spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual
representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's
perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and
reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery.
Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not
only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive
performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal data is known to be helpful for visual tracking by improving
robustness to appearance variations. However, sensor synchronization challenges
often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where
shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on
tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly,
under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance
degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to
effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker
should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates.
This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion
mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy
that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is
critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts
to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive
experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks,
excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings. The code
and benchmark will be publicly available at

Result: 发现扰动和梯度方法在遥感场景中存在局限性，而鲁棒性和随机化指标更稳定。

Conclusion: 提出了遥感图像场景分类中选择解释方法、指标和超参数的指南。

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for
scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing
(RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially
developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their
direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,
we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the
context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and
experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories
(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to
five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,
and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies
key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of
perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on
perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based
approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same
image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance
disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we
find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same
problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity
metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,
robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater
stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings.
Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods,
metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大模型处理高分辨率图像时视觉标记过多且无关的问题，避免昂贵的标注成本。

Method: 采用多轮对话框架和强化学习，通过自动裁剪子图像和二元奖励函数优化模型。

Result: 在无标注数据上训练后，MGPO在多个基准测试中表现优于GRPO和OpenAI模型。

Conclusion: MGPO展示了强化学习在提升模型视觉定位能力上的潜力，尤其在无标注数据场景下表现突出。

Abstract: State-of-the-art large multi-modal models (LMMs) face challenges when
processing high-resolution images, as these inputs are converted into enormous
visual tokens, many of which are irrelevant to the downstream task. In this
paper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to
iteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images,
based on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation
framework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly
additional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge
robust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a
binary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer.
Additionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual
grounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we
design a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss
computation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby
promoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when
trained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding
annotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared
to GRPO, leading to 5.4\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and
5.2\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench.
Notably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses
OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench. Codes are available at

TL;DR: 该论文通过引入几何感知（单目深度估计）来增强视频实例分割（VIS）的鲁棒性，提出了三种集成方法，其中EDC和SV表现优异，EDC方法在OVIS基准测试中达到56.2 AP，创下新纪录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频实例分割（VIS）面临遮挡、运动模糊和外观变化等挑战，需要增强鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了三种深度集成方法：EDC（扩展深度通道）、SV（共享ViT）和DS（深度监督），并系统评估其效果。

Result: EDC和SV显著提升了VIS的鲁棒性，EDC方法在OVIS基准测试中达到56.2 AP，创下新纪录。

Conclusion: 深度信息是提升视频理解鲁棒性的关键因素。

Abstract: Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) fundamentally struggles with pervasive
challenges including object occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations
during temporal association. To overcome these limitations, this work
introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically
leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three
distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method
concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing
ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and
segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as
an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited
effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly
enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets
56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work
conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种稀疏表示方法，通过两阶段策略提升神经表面重建的分辨率和效率，显著减少存储需求并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集3D特征体积在神经表面重建中效果显著，但高分辨率下存储效率低，限制了重建质量。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：先预测体素占用率，再在占用率高的体素中进行特征计算和体积渲染，并开发了高效采样和查询算法。

Result: 存储需求减少50倍以上，支持512^3分辨率（通常为128^3），重建精度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏表示方法显著提升了重建质量和效率，适用于高分辨率场景。

Abstract: Generalizable neural surface reconstruction has become a compelling technique
to reconstruct from few images without per-scene optimization, where dense 3D
feature volume has proven effective as a global representation of scenes.
However, the dense representation does not scale well to increasing voxel
resolutions, severely limiting the reconstruction quality. We thus present a
sparse representation method, that maximizes memory efficiency and enables
significantly higher resolution reconstructions on standard hardware. We
implement this through a two-stage approach: First training a network to
predict voxel occupancies from posed images and associated depth maps, then
computing features and performing volume rendering only in voxels with
sufficiently high occupancy estimates. To support this sparse representation,
we developed custom algorithms for efficient sampling, feature aggregation, and
querying from sparse volumes-overcoming the dense-volume assumptions inherent
in existing works. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach
reduces storage requirements by more than 50 times without performance
degradation, enabling reconstructions at $512^3$ resolution compared to the
typical $128^3$ on similar hardware, and achieving superior reconstruction
accuracy over current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Tora2在多条件视频生成领域取得了重要进展，首次实现了多实体外观和运动的同步定制。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformer models for motion-guided video
generation, such as Tora, have shown significant progress. In this paper, we
present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design
improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion
customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor
that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set
entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous
methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to
integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each
entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal
conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that
jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit
mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best
knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization
of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate
that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization
methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a
critical advancement in multi-condition video generation. Project page:

Motivation: 扩散模型在有限训练样本下容易过拟合，影响泛化能力和输出多样性，尤其是在单图像定制任务中。

Method: T-LoRA采用动态微调策略和权重参数化技术，根据扩散时间步调整低秩更新，并通过正交初始化确保适配器组件的独立性。

Result: 实验表明，T-LoRA在概念保真度和文本对齐方面优于标准LoRA和其他个性化技术。

Conclusion: T-LoRA在数据有限和资源受限的场景中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing
pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from
overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization
capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most
impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image,
as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We
introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework
specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show
that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones,
necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates
two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts
rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight
parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components
through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and
its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model
personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept
fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in
data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决现有CIR方法依赖昂贵人工标注三元组的问题，提升可扩展性和零样本能力。

Method: 利用LLM生成多样化提示，控制文本到图像生成模型生成图像对，并过滤重组为CIRHS数据集；提出CoAlign框架实现全局对齐和局部推理。

Result: 在三个常用基准上实现出色的零样本性能，并在监督训练中超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 首次证明完全合成数据集训练CIR模型的可行性，验证了CoAlign框架的有效性。

Abstract: As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR)
aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although
many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance
on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot
capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic
triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image
Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a
large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a
text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements
in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS
dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a
novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning
within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and
informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign
achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks,
demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a
fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method
outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the
effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS
dataset will be released soon.

Result: 在四个广泛使用的基准数据集上的实验表明，SCINet优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SCINet通过语义共现洞察和跨模态融合，有效解决了部分多标签学习的挑战，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely
annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels,
and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the
ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we
emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is
key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic
Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for
partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant
prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture
text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce
instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module
that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and
co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose
an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's
understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image
transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label
confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Machine learning-based Deepfake detection models have achieved impressive
results on benchmark datasets, yet their performance often deteriorates
significantly when evaluated on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we
investigate an ensemble-based approach for improving the generalization of
deepfake detection systems across diverse datasets. Building on a recent
open-source benchmark, we combine prediction probabilities from several
state-of-the-art asymmetric models proposed at top venues. Our experiments span
two distinct out-of-domain datasets and demonstrate that no single model
consistently outperforms others across settings. In contrast, ensemble-based
predictions provide more stable and reliable performance in all scenarios. Our
results suggest that asymmetric ensembling offers a robust and scalable
solution for real-world deepfake detection where prior knowledge of forgery
type or quality is often unavailable.

Motivation: 在GNSS信号缺失的密集城市区域，现有方法依赖实时GNSS和IMU数据，但定位不稳定。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用预训练的点Transformer模型分割道路点，提取道路骨架和交叉点进行全局对齐，再通过RBF插值局部优化，并结合SRTM数据进行高程校正。

Result: 在KITTI和Perth数据集上，平面配准精度分别提高了55.3%和77.4%，高程相关性分别提升了30.5%和50.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖先验定位信息，显著提升了城市尺度点云的地理配准精度。

Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant
challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and
bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that
require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.
However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in
localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration
and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite
images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of
city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach
employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and
then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as
well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is
performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using
radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied
to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve
vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI
benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the
KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard
deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a
55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks
GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the
GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\%
improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation
correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth
dataset.

Method: GCDA框架通过双流文本编码器、字符感知注意力机制和OCR微调三个阶段，优化文本生成的质量。

Result: 实验表明，GCDA在文本渲染（字符错误率和单词错误率显著降低）和图像合成质量（FID为14.3）上均达到最优。

Conclusion: GCDA为文本到图像生成中的文本可读性问题提供了有效解决方案，并在多个指标上实现了新的SOTA。

Abstract: The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in
digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to
produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics
of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these
models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled
text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical
purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces
a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware
Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three
well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder
that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph
representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input
text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of
the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to
limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to
avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning
phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be
legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,
such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new
state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text
rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error
Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality
on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

Conclusion: VisualSpeaker不仅提升了动画质量，还支持准确的嘴部动作，对提升手语虚拟形象的表现力至关重要。

Abstract: Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive
avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior
methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their
ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer
vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this
gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech
recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual
lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting
avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model
during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker
improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual
quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of
mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate
mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation aims to generate synchronized lip
movements and vivid facial expressions. However, most existing approaches focus
on static and predefined emotion labels, limiting their diversity and
naturalness. To address these challenges, we propose MEDTalk, a novel framework
for fine-grained and dynamic emotional talking head generation. Our approach
first disentangles content and emotion embedding spaces from motion sequences
using a carefully designed cross-reconstruction process, enabling independent
control over lip movements and facial expressions. Beyond conventional
audio-driven lip synchronization, we integrate audio and speech text,
predicting frame-wise intensity variations and dynamically adjusting static
emotion features to generate realistic emotional expressions. Furthermore, to
enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including
text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of
user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our
generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production
pipeline.

modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture
long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that
dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align
critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions.
Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM
achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning.
Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal
characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for
autonomous driving applications. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有法线积分方法通常隐式处理深度不连续性，且仅适用于正交或理想针孔相机，限制了其应用范围。

Result: 在标准法线积分基准测试中达到最优性能，首次直接支持通用中央相机模型。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了法线积分的精度和适用性，为光度形状重建技术提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering a 3D surface from its surface normal map, a problem known as
normal integration, is a key component for photometric shape reconstruction
techniques such as shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. The vast majority
of existing approaches for normal integration handle only implicitly the
presence of depth discontinuities and are limited to orthographic or ideal
pinhole cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that allows
modeling discontinuities explicitly and handling generic central cameras. Our
key idea is based on a local planarity assumption, that we model through
constraints between surface normals and ray directions. Compared to existing
methods, our approach more accurately approximates the relation between depth
and surface normals, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal
integration benchmark, and is the first to directly handle generic central
camera models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过合成文化数据集CulTwin和定制对比学习改进CLIP模型的方法，以提升其在细粒度文化概念识别中的表现，同时保持其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在多模态理解中表现优异，但在区分视觉相似但文化背景不同的概念时存在困难，主要由于缺乏高质量文化特定数据集和上下文知识。

Method: 设计了数据生成流程，利用开源视觉语言模型和文本到图像扩散模型构建CulTwin数据集，并通过定制对比学习微调CLIP模型，创建CultureCLIP。

Result: 在文化相关基准测试中，CultureCLIP比基础CLIP模型表现更优，某些任务中细粒度概念识别提高了5.49%，同时保持了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过数据合成和模型微调方法，CultureCLIP能够有效捕捉细微的文化差异，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal
understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual
features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally
distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality
culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the
absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these
challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages
open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a
synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired
concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but
represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to
create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced
captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling
finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities.
Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms
the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained
concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original
generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and
VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.

*Chihan Huang,Hao Tang*

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack
methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm
perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual
capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward
generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based
approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to
instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed
for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation
injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on
diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable
adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution
towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map
to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated
samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of
natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but
also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA
datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in
both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore,
the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables
ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.

Motivation: 现有情感计算研究中，缺乏高质量的多模态数据集，且接触式设备可能干扰真实情绪反应，因此需要开发非接触式情感识别方法。

Method: 提出CAST-Phys数据集，包含PPG、EDA、RR等生理信号和高分辨率面部视频，支持远程信号恢复和多模态融合分析。

Conclusion: CAST-Phys数据集为远程情感识别技术提供了高质量资源，多模态方法展示了其在非接触式情感识别中的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, affective computing and its applications have become a
fast-growing research topic. Despite significant advancements, the lack of
affective multi-modal datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing
accurate emotion recognition systems. Furthermore, the use of contact-based
devices during emotion elicitation often unintentionally influences the
emotional experience, reducing or altering the genuine spontaneous emotional
response. This limitation highlights the need for methods capable of extracting
affective cues from multiple modalities without physical contact, such as
remote physiological emotion recognition. To address this, we present the
Contactless Affective States Through Physiological Signals Database
(CAST-Phys), a novel high-quality dataset explicitly designed for multi-modal
remote physiological emotion recognition using facial and physiological cues.
The dataset includes diverse physiological signals, such as
photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiration rate
(RR), alongside high-resolution uncompressed facial video recordings, enabling
the potential for remote signal recovery. Our analysis highlights the crucial
role of physiological signals in realistic scenarios where facial expressions
alone may not provide sufficient emotional information. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the potential of remote multi-modal emotion recognition by
evaluating the impact of individual and fused modalities, showcasing its
effectiveness in advancing contactless emotion recognition technologies.

TL;DR: Ref-Unlock是一种基于3D高斯溅射的几何感知反射建模框架，通过分离透射和反射成分，提升复杂反射场景的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如NeRF和3DGS）在处理反射表面时，常将反射误认为物理几何，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 采用双分支表示和高阶球谐函数捕捉高频反射细节，结合反射移除模块和几何感知平滑约束。

Result: Ref-Unlock显著优于传统GS方法，与NeRF模型竞争，并支持灵活反射编辑。

Conclusion: Ref-Unlock为反射场景的逼真渲染提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately rendering scenes with reflective surfaces remains a significant
challenge in novel view synthesis, as existing methods like Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often misinterpret reflections
as physical geometry, resulting in degraded reconstructions. Previous methods
rely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to
misalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene
geometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the
accumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in
blurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose
Ref-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected
components to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric
consistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch
representation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency
reflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo
reflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we
incorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness
constraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms
classical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with
NeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)
driven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and
generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes. Our code

Conclusion: Omni-Video为统一视频建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have
led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production
and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing
images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video
understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and
effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as
instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used
as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos
conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system
for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a
lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on
the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the
former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens
to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage
training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion
decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically
demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities
across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了多对象图像增强中的偏差和多样性问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation
in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating
multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely
entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated
objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images,
resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited
help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose
a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image
augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion
strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge
into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation
between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a
reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss
for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead
of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the
generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the
generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and
showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization
capabilities. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统Laplacian算子需要严格定义的结构，而简单卷积核和消息传递层对边界有偏置，需一种更通用的平滑方法。

Result: 生成的算子不仅近似热扩散，还保留了Laplacian的谱信息，适用于点云等不规则数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为不规则数据提供了一种有效的类Laplacian平滑工具，适用于形状分析与匹配。

Abstract: Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in
machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as
vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential
geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with
strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a
carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most
practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing
layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this
gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general
similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized
into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from
Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn
algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural
behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing
and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or
mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate
heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself,
with applications to shape analysis and matching.

Abstract: The creation of 3D assets with explicit, editable part structures is crucial
for advancing interactive applications, yet most generative methods produce

framework for part-aware 3D object generation designed to achieve high semantic
decoupling among components while maintaining robust structural cohesion.
OmniPart uniquely decouples this complex task into two synergistic stages: (1)
an autoregressive structure planning module generates a controllable,
variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by
flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition
without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a
spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a
pre-trained holistic 3D generator, synthesizes all 3D parts simultaneously and
consistently within the planned layout. Our approach supports user-defined part
granularity, precise localization, and enables diverse downstream applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art
performance, paving the way for more interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D

Abstract: Technical reports and articles often contain valuable information in the form
of semi-structured data like charts, and figures. Interpreting these and using
the information from them is essential for downstream tasks such as question

with the precision required for scientific data interpretation, particularly in

  We conducted a series of experiments using models with 5B to 8B parameters.
Our strongest individual model, InternVL3, achieved ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L F1
scores of \textbf{0.740} and a BERTScore of \textbf{0.983} on the SciVQA test

improved performance compared to most individual models, though InternVL3
remained the strongest standalone performer. Our findings underscore the
effectiveness of prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning and ensemble
modeling in improving the model's ability in visual question answering.

Abstract: Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to infer both the 3D geometry and
semantics of a scene from single images. In contrast to prior work on SSC that
heavily relies on expensive ground-truth annotations, we approach SSC in an
unsupervised setting. Our novel method, SceneDINO, adapts techniques from
self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding
to SSC. Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency
self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given
a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO
features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation
approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised
scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.
Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current
supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization
and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a
strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: RSRefSeg 2通过解耦设计和基础模型协作，显著提升了遥感图像分割的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation provides a flexible and
fine-grained framework for remote sensing scene analysis via vision-language
collaborative interpretation. Current approaches predominantly utilize a
three-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,
and pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in
managing complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal
alignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates
target localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling
amplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model
generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose
RSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow
into a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine
segmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with
SAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model
collaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to
activate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate
localization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in
multi-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order
prompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via
decomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These
optimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level
refined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive
experiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2
surpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex
semantic interpretation. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类运动数据标注困难，但适合训练鲁棒的点跟踪器。

Method: 使用SMPL模型拟合视频中的人体，生成伪轨迹，处理遮挡并过滤不可靠轨迹。

Result: 在TAP-Vid基准测试中表现最优，数据量和计算资源需求大幅减少。

Conclusion: AnthroTAP为点跟踪任务提供了一种高效的数据生成和训练方法。

Abstract: Human motion, with its inherent complexities, such as non-rigid deformations,
articulated movements, clothing distortions, and frequent occlusions caused by
limbs or other individuals, provides a rich and challenging source of
supervision that is crucial for training robust and generalizable point
trackers. Despite the suitability of human motion, acquiring extensive training
data for point tracking remains difficult due to laborious manual annotation.
Our proposed pipeline, AnthroTAP, addresses this by proposing an automated
pipeline to generate pseudo-labeled training data, leveraging the Skinned
Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model. We first fit the SMPL model to detected
humans in video frames, project the resulting 3D mesh vertices onto 2D image

### [180] [PBE Meets LLM: When Few Examples Aren't Few-Shot Enough](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05403)
*Shuning Zhang,Yongjoo Park*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在基于示例编程（PBE）任务中的表现，提出混合方法提升成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在PBE任务中的表现，填补传统PBE系统与LLMs之间的性能差距。

Method: 通过表格数据转换任务测试LLMs，比较不同提示策略，并提出混合方法结合传统PBE求解器。

Result: LLMs支持更多样化的输入格式且准确率更高，但在模糊任务中表现不佳；混合方法显著提升成功率。

Conclusion: LLMs在PBE任务中表现优异，混合方法结合两者优势，适用于更广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate code from natural language
descriptions. Their performance is typically evaluated using programming
benchmarks that simulate real-world tasks. These benchmarks provide
specifications in the form of docstrings, function signatures, or bug reports.
The model then generates a program, which is tested against predefined test
cases. In contrast, Programming by Example (PBE) uses input-output examples as
the specification. Traditional PBE systems rely on search-based methods over
restricted transformation spaces. They are usually designed for narrow domains
and fixed input formats. It remains unclear how well LLMs perform on PBE tasks.
  In this work, we evaluate LLMs on PBE tasks involving tabular data
transformations. We prompt models to generate functions that convert an input
table to an output table. We test the generated functions on unseen inputs to
measure accuracy. Our study includes multiple LLMs and evaluates different
prompting strategies, such as one-shot vs. multi-try. We also compare
performance with and without PBE-specific knowledge. Finally, we propose a
hybrid method that calls a traditional PBE solver first, and then falls back to
LLMs if necessary. Our results show that LLMs support more diverse input
formats and achieve higher accuracy than conventional methods. However, they
struggle with tasks that contain ambiguity. The hybrid approach improves
overall success by combining the strengths of both approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的新型框架GTRSS，用于高效解决Top-k代表性相似子轨迹查询问题，显著提升了查询速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的过滤-验证框架，导致响应时间慢，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: GTRSS采用双层图索引离线聚类相似子轨迹，在线阶段通过导航图快速检索结果，结合R树和网格过滤优化索引构建。

Result: 实验显示GTRSS检索准确率超过90%，查询性能提升两个数量级。

Conclusion: GTRSS是首个基于图的解决方案，显著提升了子轨迹搜索的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Trajectory mining has attracted significant attention. This paper addresses
the Top-k Representative Similar Subtrajectory Query (TRSSQ) problem, which
aims to find the k most representative subtrajectories similar to a query.
Existing methods rely on costly filtering-validation frameworks, resulting in
slow response times. Addressing this, we propose GTRSS, a novel Graph-based
Top-k Representative Similar Subtrajectory Query framework. During the offline
phase, GTRSS builds a dual-layer graph index that clusters trajectories
containing similar representative subtrajectories. In the online phase, it
efficiently retrieves results by navigating the graph toward query-relevant
clusters, bypassing full-dataset scanning and heavy computation. To support
this, we introduce the Data Trajectory Similarity Metric (DTSM) to measure the
most similar subtrajectory pair. We further combine R-tree and grid filtering
with DTSM pruning rules to speed up index building. To the best of our
knowledge, GTRSS is the first graph-based solution for top-k subtrajectory
search. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that GTRSS significantly
enhances both efficiency and accuracy, achieving a retrieval accuracy of over
90 percent and up to two orders of magnitude speedup in query performance.

Motivation: 生成式AI在商业应用中因LLM快速演变导致提示不一致，影响应用可靠性，需要一种系统化方法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出提示迁移框架，包括提示重新设计和迁移测试平台，并以Tursio企业搜索应用为案例进行分析。

Result: 结构化提示迁移能完全恢复因模型漂移而丧失的应用可靠性。

Conclusion: 强调提示生命周期管理和鲁棒测试对确保生成式AI应用可靠性的重要性。

Abstract: Generative AI is transforming business applications by enabling natural
language interfaces and intelligent automation. However, the underlying large
language models (LLMs) are evolving rapidly and so prompting them consistently
is a challenge. This leads to inconsistent and unpredictable application
behavior, undermining the reliability that businesses require for
mission-critical workflows. In this paper, we introduce the concept of prompt
migration as a systematic approach to stabilizing GenAI applications amid
changing LLMs. Using the Tursio enterprise search application as a case study,
we analyze the impact of successive GPT model upgrades, detail our migration
framework including prompt redesign and a migration testbed, and demonstrate
how these techniques restore application consistency. Our results show that
structured prompt migration can fully recover the application reliability that
was lost due to model drift. We conclude with practical lessons learned,
emphasizing the need for prompt lifecycle management and robust testing to
ensure dependable GenAI-powered business applications.

Motivation: 由于时空数据在移动应用中的重要性日益增加，而现有基准测试仅关注孤立的小方面，缺乏全面的应用导向测试套件。

Method: 识别了基准测试套件的需求，讨论了领域特定挑战，并设计了模块化基准测试套件的架构。

Result: 提出了构建应用导向基准测试套件的紧迫性及其架构设计。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发一个全面的、模块化的时空数据库系统基准测试套件，以满足实际应用需求。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal data play a key role for mobility-based applications and are
their produced volume is growing continuously, among others, due to the
increased availability of IoT devices.
  When working with spatiotemporal data, developers rely on spatiotemporal
database systems such as PostGIS or MobilityDB.
  For better understanding their quality of service behavior and then choosing
the best system, benchmarking is the go-to approach.
  Unfortunately, existing work in this field studies only small isolated
aspects and a comprehensive application-centric benchmark suite is still
missing.
  In this paper, we argue that an application-centric benchmark suite for
spatiotemporal database systems is urgently needed.
  We identify requirements for such a benchmark suite, discuss domain-specific
challenges, and sketch-out the architecture of a modular benchmarking suite.

Method: 将查询分解为小规模子查询，利用FaaS平台的即时扩展能力并行执行。

Result: 部分解决了大规模时空数据处理的扩展性需求。

Conclusion: 无服务器计算为时空数据处理提供了一种新的扩展性解决方案。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal data are being produced in continuously growing volumes by a
variety of data sources and a variety of application fields rely on rapid
analysis of such data. Existing systems such as PostGIS or MobilityDB usually
build on relational database systems, thus, inheriting their scale-out
characteristics. As a consequence, big spatiotemporal data scenarios still have
limited support even though many query types can easily be parallelized. In
this paper, we propose our vision of a native serverless data processing
approach for spatiotemporal data: We break down queries into small subqueries
which then leverage the near-instant scaling of Function-as-a-Service platforms
to execute them in parallel. With this, we partially solve the scalability
needs of big spatiotemporal data processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据中手动识别有用的数据透视表组合耗时且困难，传统方法在多样性和实用性上表现不足。

Method: 提出SAGE系统，结合数据语义感知模型和贪心算法，高效推荐多样且实用的数据透视表。

Result: 实验表明SAGE在三个真实数据集上优于其他方法，并能高效处理高维数据。

Conclusion: SAGE通过数据语义感知和算法优化，显著提升了数据透视表推荐的多样性和实用性。

Abstract: Data summarization is essential to discover insights from large datasets. In
a spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data
by computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others. However,
identifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables
remains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets. We formalize the
problem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot
tables, eliminating the tedious manual process. A crucial aspect of
recommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them. Traditional works
inadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to
consider the problem of pivot table diversification.
  We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted
diverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k
recommendations that cause redundancy. SAGE ensures that each pivot table is
insightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences,
while also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each
other, offering a diverse recommendation. We make two key technical
contributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a
single pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a
scalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot
tables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce
the combinatorial search space. Our extensive experiments on three real-world
datasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently
scales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, we present
several case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over
commercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据库研发需要大量SQL查询进行基准测试，但获取真实查询困难且现有生成方法受限。

Method: SQLBarber提供声明式接口，利用LLM生成SQL模板，并通过自校正模块和贝叶斯优化器优化查询成本分布。

Result: 实验表明，SQLBarber能高效生成定制化SQL模板，生成时间减少1-3个数量级，且更符合目标成本分布。

Conclusion: SQLBarber是唯一能生成定制化SQL模板的系统，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries
for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is
challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are
limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address
this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i)
eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while
providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to
constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of
queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and
execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift
and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost
distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber
introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate
customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a
self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based
on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different
predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost
distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty
levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from
Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show
that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates.
It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and
significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared
with existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高阶协作的联邦图神经网络（HC-FGNN），用于在保护隐私的同时提高QoS预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦图神经网络（FGNN）在QoS预测中未能利用隐式的用户间交互，导致预测效果受限。

Method: 通过注意力机制放大显式用户-服务图以捕捉高阶协作，并采用轻量级消息聚合提高计算效率。

Result: 在两个真实QoS数据集上的实验表明，HC-FGNN具有高预测准确性和隐私保护优势。

Conclusion: HC-FGNN有效解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了隐私保护下的高精度QoS预测。

Abstract: Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) data crucial for cloud service selection,
where user privacy is a critical concern. Federated Graph Neural Networks
(FGNNs) can perform QoS data prediction as well as maintaining user privacy.
However, existing FGNN-based QoS predictors commonly implement on-device
training on scattered explicit user-service graphs, thereby failing to utilize
the implicit user-user interactions. To address this issue, this study proposes
a high order collaboration-oriented federated graph neural network (HC-FGNN) to
obtain accurate QoS prediction with privacy preservation. Concretely, it
magnifies the explicit user-service graphs following the principle of attention
mechanism to obtain the high order collaboration, which reflects the implicit
user-user interactions. Moreover, it utilizes a lightweight-based message
aggregation way to improve the computational efficiency. The extensive
experiments on two QoS datasets from real application indicate that the
proposed HC-FGNN possesses the advantages of high prediction accurate and
privacy protection.

Conclusion: Air-FedGA有效解决了同步和异构性问题，显著提升了联邦学习的效率。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a new paradigm to train AI models over distributed
edge devices (i.e., workers) using their local data, while confronting various
challenges including communication resource constraints, edge heterogeneity and
data Non-IID. Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a promising technique to
achieve efficient utilization of communication resource for model aggregation
by leveraging the superposition property of a wireless multiple access channel
(MAC). However, AirComp requires strict synchronization among edge devices,
which is hard to achieve in heterogeneous scenarios. In this paper, we propose
an AirComp-based grouping asynchronous federated learning mechanism
(Air-FedGA), which combines the advantages of AirComp and asynchronous FL to
address the communication and heterogeneity challenges. Specifically, Air-FedGA
organizes workers into groups and performs over-the-air aggregation within each
group, while groups asynchronously communicate with the parameter server to
update the global model. In this way, Air-FedGA accelerates the FL model
training by over-the-air aggregation, while relaxing the synchronization
requirement of this aggregation technology. We theoretically prove the
convergence of Air-FedGA. We formulate a training time minimization problem for
Air-FedGA and propose the power control and worker grouping algorithm to solve
it, which jointly optimizes the power scaling factors at edge devices, the
denoising factors at the parameter server, as well as the worker grouping
strategy. We conduct experiments on classical models and datasets, and the
results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism and algorithm can speed up FL
model training by 29.9%-71.6% compared with the state-of-the-art solutions.

Conclusion: ECORE有效优化边缘设备性能，适用于智能城市等场景。

Abstract: Edge computing enables data processing closer to the source, significantly
reducing latency an essential requirement for real-time vision-based analytics
such as object detection in surveillance and smart city environments. However,
these tasks place substantial demands on resource constrained edge devices,
making the joint optimization of energy consumption and detection accuracy
critical. To address this challenge, we propose ECORE, a framework that
integrates multiple dynamic routing strategies including estimation based
techniques and a greedy selection algorithm to direct image processing requests
to the most suitable edge device-model pair. ECORE dynamically balances energy
efficiency and detection performance based on object characteristics. We
evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on real-world datasets,
comparing the proposed routers against widely used baseline techniques. The
evaluation leverages established object detection models (YOLO, SSD,
EfficientDet) and diverse edge platforms, including Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry
Pi 4 and 5, and TPU accelerators. Results demonstrate that our proposed
context-aware routing strategies can reduce energy consumption and latency by
45% and 49%, respectively, while incurring only a 2% loss in detection accuracy
compared to accuracy-centric methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a compelling methodology for the
management of distributed data, marked by significant advancements in recent
years. In this paper, we propose an efficient FL approach that capitalizes on
additional downlink bandwidth resources to ensure timely update dissemination.
Initially, we implement this strategy within an asynchronous framework,
introducing the Asynchronous Staleness-aware Model Update (FedASMU), which
integrates both server-side and device-side methodologies. On the server side,
we present an asynchronous FL system model that employs a dynamic model
aggregation technique, which harmonizes local model updates with the global
model to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. Concurrently, on the device
side, we propose an adaptive model adjustment mechanism that integrates the
latest global model with local models during training to further elevate
accuracy. Subsequently, we extend this approach to a synchronous context,
referred to as FedSSMU. Theoretical analyses substantiate the convergence of
our proposed methodologies. Extensive experiments, encompassing six models and
five public datasets, demonstrate that FedASMU and FedSSMU significantly
surpass baseline methods in terms of both accuracy (up to 145.87%) and
efficiency (up to 97.59%).

Conclusion: 该研究为可扩展的ODA知识图谱奠定了基础，支持异构HPC系统内的分析和跨系统分析。

Abstract: Modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems generate massive volumes of
heterogeneous telemetry data from millions of sensors monitoring compute,
memory, power, cooling, and storage subsystems. As HPC infrastructures scale to
support increasingly complex workloads-including generative AI-the need for
efficient, reliable, and interoperable telemetry analysis becomes critical.
Operational Data Analytics (ODA) has emerged to address these demands; however,
the reliance on schema-less storage solutions limits data accessibility and
semantic integration. Ontologies and knowledge graphs (KG) provide an effective
way to enable efficient and expressive data querying by capturing domain
semantics, but they face challenges such as significant storage overhead and
the limited applicability of existing ontologies, which are often tailored to
specific HPC systems only. In this paper, we present the first unified ontology
for ODA in HPC systems, designed to enable semantic interoperability across
heterogeneous data centers. Our ontology models telemetry data from the two
largest publicly available ODA datasets-M100 (Cineca, Italy) and F-DATA
(Fugaku, Japan)-within a single data model. The ontology is validated through
36 competency questions reflecting real-world stakeholder requirements, and we
introduce modeling optimizations that reduce knowledge graph (KG) storage
overhead by up to 38.84% compared to a previous approach, with an additional
26.82% reduction depending on the desired deployment configuration. This work
paves the way for scalable ODA KGs and supports not only analysis within
individual systems, but also cross-system analysis across heterogeneous HPC
systems.

Motivation: 现有Wi-Fi感知系统需持续通信且性能易受中断影响，Baton旨在解决特征缺失下的目标跟踪问题。

Method: 探索Wi-Fi特征矩阵在水平和垂直维度的相关性，提出STAP算法实现特征无缝传递。

Result: 实验显示Baton在通信占空比20%时，中位跟踪误差0.46m，较现有方案降低79.19%。

Conclusion: Baton系统在Wi-Fi特征严重缺失时仍能高效跟踪目标，优于现有方案。

Abstract: Wi-Fi contact-free sensing systems have attracted widespread attention due to
their ubiquity and convenience. The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
technology utilizes off-the-shelf Wi-Fi communication signals for sensing,
which further promotes the deployment of intelligent sensing applications.
However, current Wi-Fi sensing systems often require prolonged and unnecessary
communication between transceivers, and brief communication interruptions will
lead to significant performance degradation. This paper proposes Baton, the
first system capable of accurately tracking targets even under severe Wi-Fi
feature deficiencies. To be specific, we explore the relevance of the Wi-Fi
feature matrix from both horizontal and vertical dimensions. The horizontal
dimension reveals feature correlation across different Wi-Fi links, while the
vertical dimension reveals feature correlation among different time slots.
Based on the above principle, we propose the Simultaneous Tracking And
Predicting (STAP) algorithm, which enables the seamless transfer of Wi-Fi
features over time and across different links, akin to passing a baton. We
implement the system on commercial devices, and the experimental results show
that our system outperforms existing solutions with a median tracking error of
0.46m, even when the communication duty cycle is as low as 20.00%. Compared
with the state-of-the-art, our system reduces the tracking error by 79.19% in
scenarios with severe Wi-Fi feature deficiencies.

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) unleash powerful analysis
capabilities for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Earth observation images in
the data center. However, fast satellite motion, brief satellite-ground station
(GS) contact windows, and large size of the images pose a data download
challenge. To enable near real-time Earth observation applications (e.g.,
disaster and extreme weather monitoring), we should explore how to deploy LVLM
in LEO satellite networks, and design SpaceVerse, an efficient satellite-ground
synergistic LVLM inference system. To this end, firstly, we deploy compact
LVLMs on satellites for lightweight tasks, whereas regular LVLMs operate on GSs
to handle computationally intensive tasks. Then, we propose a computing and

TL;DR: Intra-DP是一种针对移动边缘计算（MEC）优化的高性能协作推理系统，通过并行计算技术减少传输瓶颈，显著降低延迟和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的移动设备上部署深度神经网络（DNN）面临实时性能和资源限制的挑战，现有方法存在传输瓶颈问题。

Method: 采用基于局部算子的并行计算技术，将计算分解为独立子操作，并通过并行执行重叠计算与传输。

Result: 相比现有方法，Intra-DP将每次推理延迟降低50%，能耗减少75%，且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: Intra-DP有效解决了MEC中的传输瓶颈问题，实现了高效且节能的DNN推理。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained mobile devices
presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving real-time
performance while simultaneously coping with limited computational resources
and battery life. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers collaborative
inference with GPU servers as a promising solution, existing approaches
primarily rely on layer-wise model partitioning and undergo significant
transmission bottlenecks caused by the sequential execution of DNN operations.
To address this challenge, we present Intra-DP, a high-performance
collaborative inference system optimized for DNN inference on MEC. Intra DP
employs a novel parallel computing technique based on local operators (i.e.,
operators whose minimum unit input is not the entire input tensor, such as the
convolution kernel). By decomposing their computations (operations) into
several independent sub-operations and overlapping the computation and
transmission of different sub-operations through parallel execution, Intra-DP
mitigates transmission bottlenecks in MEC, achieving fast and energy-efficient
inference. The evaluation demonstrates that Intra-DP reduces per-inference
latency by up to 50% and energy consumption by up to 75% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, without sacrificing accuracy.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种网络数据平面加速架构，通过内联处理DRL模型更新减少异步分布式强化学习中的陈旧性问题，提升收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步分布式强化学习（DRL）在大规模训练中因网络拥塞和数据包丢失导致模型更新陈旧，影响收敛性能。

Method: 设计了一种新颖的队列机制，结合兼容的更新以减少冗余流量；提供轻量级传输控制机制，并引入Age-of-Model（AoM）指标评估模型效用。

Result: 该架构显著减少了更新陈旧性和拥塞，提高了异步DRL工作负载的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 通过内联处理和网络加速，有效解决了异步DRL中的陈旧性问题，提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can suffer from
degraded convergence when model updates become stale, often the result of
network congestion and packet loss during large-scale training. This work
introduces a network data-plane acceleration architecture that mitigates such
staleness by enabling inline processing of DRL model updates as they traverse
the accelerator engine. To this end, we design and prototype a novel queueing
mechanism that opportunistically combines compatible updates sharing a network
element, reducing redundant traffic and preserving update utility.
Complementing this we provide a lightweight transmission control mechanism at
the worker nodes that is guided by feedback from the in-network accelerator. To
assess model utility at line rate, we introduce the Age-of-Model (AoM) metric
as a proxy for staleness and verify global fairness and responsiveness
properties using a formal verification method. Our evaluations demonstrate that
this architecture significantly reduces update staleness and congestion,
ultimately improving the convergence rate in asynchronous DRL workloads.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在去中心化身份（DID）的群体控制场景下，如何通过链上机制实现无信任的DID文档（DDO）更新授权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DID的群体控制场景缺乏明确的更新授权机制，现有规范未解决这一问题，因此需要一种链上、无信任的技术方案。

Method: 提出了一种链上机制，支持群体控制的DID控制器编程其治理规则，实现账本无关和适应性强的DDO更新授权。

Result: 研究表明，可以开发一种技术机制，以账本无关和适应性强的方式协调群体控制的DDO更新。

Conclusion: 本文为DID的群体控制提供了一种可行的链上解决方案，填补了现有规范的空白。

Abstract: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a paradigm for digital identity management
that offers unique privacy advantages. A key technology in SSI is Decentralized
Identifiers (DIDs) and their associated metadata, DID Documents (DDOs). DDOs
contain crucial verification material such as the public keys of the entity
identified by the DID (i.e., the DID subject) and are often anchored on a
distributed ledger to ensure security and availability. Long-lived DIDs need to
support updates (e.g., key rotation). Ideally, only the DID subject should
authorize DDO updates. However, in practice, update capabilities may be shared
or delegated. While the DID specification acknowledges such scenarios, it does
not define how updates should be authorized when multiple entities jointly
control a DID (i.e., group control). This article examines the implementation
of an on-chain, trustless mechanism enabling DID controllers under group
control to program their governance rules. The main research question is the
following: Can a technical mechanism be developed to orchestrate on-chain group
control of a DDO in a ledger-agnostic and adaptable manner?

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CoRe是一个高质量、人工验证的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在静态分析任务中的表现，发现LLMs在深层语义理解和多步推理任务中仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注端到端结果（如代码修复或生成），而忽略了模型对程序语义推理能力的评估。

Method: 提出CoRe基准测试，包含12,553个任务实例，涵盖数据依赖、控制依赖和信息流，采用语义感知的多样化采样策略。

Result: 评估10种主流LLMs，发现它们在识别依赖关系上表现良好，但在深层语义理解和多步推理任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs在复杂控制结构和反向依赖模式等任务中的挑战，为提升其代码推理能力提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted across diverse software
engineering domains, such as code generation, program repair, and vulnerability
detection. These applications require understanding beyond surface-level code
patterns: value propagation, control flow, and interdependence between program
elements. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate end-to-end outcomes,
such as whether code is correctly repaired or generated, leaving the models
ability for program semantic reasoning underexplored. This work presents CoRe,
a high-quality, human-verified benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on
fundamental static analysis tasks. CoRe includes 12,553 task instances spanning
data dependency, control dependency, and information flow across programs
written in C/C++, Java, and Python. To ensure semantic diversity and reasoning
complexity, we propose a semantics-aware diverse sampling strategy that selects
targets and task instances based on structural coverage and dependency depth.
We evaluate 10 mainstream LLMs and show that, while they perform well at
identifying dependencies, models still struggle with tasks that require deeper
semantic understanding and multi-step reasoning. We further conduct qualitative
analyses to uncover key challenges, such as complex control structures and
backward dependency patterns, offering insights into improving LLMs code
reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了第三方软件组件集成中的许可证风险，通过系统文献综述提出研究方向和实践建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件开发中第三方组件的使用普遍，但许可证风险可能导致法律和运营问题，需系统性解决方案。

Method: 对80篇开源软件许可证相关论文进行系统文献综述，分类为许可证识别、风险评估和缓解。

Result: 揭示了现有解决方案的局限性，并讨论了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 综述旨在弥合学术界与工业界的差距，推动软件工程社区对许可证风险的系统治理。

Abstract: Integrating third-party software components is a common practice in modern
software development, offering significant advantages in terms of efficiency
and innovation. However, this practice is fraught with risks related to
software licensing. A lack of understanding may lead to disputes, which can
pose serious legal and operational challenges. To these ends, both academia and
industry have conducted various investigations and proposed solutions and tools
to deal with these challenges. However, significant limitations still remain.
Moreover, the rapid evolution of open-source software (OSS) licenses, as well
as the rapidly incorporated generative software engineering techniques, such as
large language models for code (CodeLLMs), are placing greater demands on the
systematic management of software license risks. To unveil the severe
challenges and explore possible future directions, we conduct the first
systematic literature review (SLR) on 80 carefully selected OSS license-related
papers, classifying existing research into three key categories, i.e., license
identification, license risk assessment, and license risk mitigation. Based on
these, we discuss challenges in existing solutions, conclude the opportunities
to shed light on future research directions and offer practical recommendations
for practitioners. We hope this thorough review will help bridge the gaps
between academia and industry and accelerate the ecosystem-wide governance of
legitimate software risks within the software engineering community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成程序的最弱前置条件（WP）在验证和运行时错误检查等领域具有重要应用，但传统方法效率有限。

Method: 结合LLMs和模糊测试，引入FG作为指导机制，利用程序执行反馈优化LLMs生成的候选WP。

Result: 在Java确定性数组程序的基准测试中，实验表明LLMs能够生成可行的候选WP，且FG能显著提升其效果。

Conclusion: LLMs结合FG是一种有效生成WP的方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The weakest precondition (WP) of a program describes the largest set of
initial states from which all terminating executions of the program satisfy a
given postcondition. The generation of WPs is an important task with practical
applications in areas ranging from verification to run-time error checking.
  This paper proposes the combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and fuzz
testing for generating WPs. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Fuzzing
Guidance (FG); FG acts as a means of directing LLMs towards correct WPs using
program execution feedback. FG utilises fuzz testing for approximately checking
the validity and weakness of candidate WPs, this information is then fed back
to the LLM as a means of context refinement.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a comprehensive benchmark
set of deterministic array programs in Java. Our experiments indicate that LLMs
are capable of producing viable candidate WPs, and that this ability can be
practically enhanced through FG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在捕捉真实软件工程的多样性和复杂性方面存在不足，且可控性和可靠性有限。

Method: CorePipe将仓库转化为全面测试用例，CoreCodeBench提供多场景基准测试，包括开发、修复和测试驱动开发问题。

Result: 实验评估了16种大语言模型，揭示了其在工程场景中的不同能力。

Conclusion: CoreCodeBench为研究大语言模型在真实工程项目的适用性提供了全面基准。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly sophisticated code
processing capabilities, evaluating their performance on engineering-level code
remains challenging. Existing repository-level benchmarks primarily focus on
single scenarios, such as code generation or bug fixing, without adequately
capturing the diversity and complexity of real-world software or project
engineering workflows. Furthermore, these benchmarks suffer from limited
controllability in question positioning and reliability issues in their
generated test cases. To address these limitations, we present CorePipe, a
fully automated pipeline that converts repositories into comprehensive test
cases, and introduce CoreCodeBench, a configurable multi-scenario
repository-level benchmark. To simulate real engineering scenarios, CorePipe
generates three types of atomic questions (Development, BugFix, and Test-Driven
Development) specifically targeting core code segments. These atomic questions
are further combined into three types of composite questions, with difficulty
levels flexibly adjusted through hyperparameter tuning. CoreCodeBench provides
a comprehensive and extensive repository-level benchmark to investigate the
applicability of LLMs in real-world engineering projects. Experiments with 16
LLMs across diverse scenarios reveal varying capabilities and offer
multi-dimensional insights into LLM performance in engineering contexts. The
code for CorePipe is available at
https://github.com/AGI-Eval-Official/CoreCodeBench, and the data for

*Igor Regis da Silva Simoes,Elaine Venson*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了使用大型语言模型（LLMs）评估代码可读性的方法，并通过实验验证了其对代码干预的敏感性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码可读性是代码质量的重要方面，但现有工具和方法存在主观性和不一致性问题，需要更标准化的评估手段。

Method: 通过准实验研究，测试了9种LLMs对三种代码干预（删除注释、替换标识符名称、重构代码）的响应，并与参考模型对比。

Result: LLMs对干预敏感，与参考模型在原始和重构代码场景中一致性高，且表现出语义敏感性。响应存在一定变异性，但结果仍具统计显著性。

Conclusion: LLMs在评估代码语义质量方面具有潜力，尤其是在标识符名称、注释与代码目的的一致性上。

Abstract: Code readability is one of the main aspects of code quality, influenced by
various properties like identifier names, comments, code structure, and
adherence to standards. However, measuring this attribute poses challenges in
both industry and academia. While static analysis tools assess attributes such
as code smells and comment percentage, code reviews introduce an element of
subjectivity. This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to
evaluate code quality attributes related to its readability in a standardized,
reproducible, and consistent manner. We conducted a quasi-experiment study to
measure the effects of code changes on Large Language Model (LLM)s
interpretation regarding its readability quality attribute. Nine LLMs were
tested, undergoing three interventions: removing comments, replacing identifier
names with obscure names, and refactoring to remove code smells. Each
intervention involved 10 batch analyses per LLM, collecting data on response
variability. We compared the results with a known reference model and tool. The
results showed that all LLMs were sensitive to the interventions, with
agreement with the reference classifier being high for the original and
refactored code scenarios. The LLMs demonstrated a strong semantic sensitivity
that the reference model did not fully capture. A thematic analysis of the LLMs
reasoning confirmed their evaluations directly reflected the nature of each
intervention. The models also exhibited response variability, with 9.37% to
14.58% of executions showing a standard deviation greater than zero, indicating
response oscillation, though this did not always compromise the statistical
significance of the results. LLMs demonstrated potential for evaluating
semantic quality aspects, such as coherence between identifier names, comments,
and documentation with code purpose.

TL;DR: zkSDK是一个模块化框架，旨在简化零知识（ZK）应用开发，通过抽象后端复杂性，自动选择最优ZK证明后端。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ZK开发工具众多且分散，开发者面临陡峭的学习曲线和碎片化体验，zkSDK旨在解决这一问题。

Method: zkSDK的核心是Presto，一种类似Python的自定义语言，用于分析程序计算负载，并结合用户定义标准动态选择最优ZK后端。

Result: 通过实际工作负载分析，zkSDK能有效选择最适合的后端，提供无缝且用户友好的开发体验。

Conclusion: zkSDK成功解决了ZK开发中的后端选择问题，提升了开发效率和体验。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of creating Zero-Knowledge (ZK) programs has led to the
development of numerous tools designed to support developers. Popular options
include being able to write in general-purpose programming languages like Rust
from Risc Zero. Other languages exist like Circom, Lib-snark, and Cairo.
However, developers entering the ZK space are faced with many different ZK
backends to choose from, leading to a steep learning curve and a fragmented
developer experience across different platforms. As a result, many developers
tend to select a single ZK backend and remain tied to it. This thesis
introduces zkSDK, a modular framework that streamlines ZK application
development by abstracting the backend complexities. At the core of zkSDK is
Presto, a custom Python-like programming language that enables the profiling
and analysis of a program to assess its computational workload intensity.
Combined with user-defined criteria, zkSDK employs a dynamic selection
algorithm to automatically choose the optimal ZK-proving backend. Through an
in-depth analysis and evaluation of real-world workloads, we demonstrate that
zkSDK effectively selects the best-suited backend from a set of supported ZK
backends, delivering a seamless and user-friendly development experience.

TL;DR: ASSURE是一个专为AI浏览器扩展设计的自动化测试框架，解决了传统测试方法无法应对的非确定性行为和复杂环境集成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测试方法无法有效评估AI浏览器扩展的非确定性行为和复杂环境集成，亟需新的测试框架。

Method: ASSURE包含模块化测试用例生成引擎、自动化执行框架和可配置验证管道，系统评估行为一致性和安全性。

Result: 在六个常用AI浏览器扩展中，ASSURE识别了531个问题，测试吞吐量比手动方法高6.4倍。

Conclusion: ASSURE为AI浏览器扩展测试提供了高效、全面的解决方案，适合集成到开发流程中。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into browser extensions has
revolutionized web browsing, enabling sophisticated functionalities like
content summarization, intelligent translation, and context-aware writing
assistance. However, these AI-powered extensions introduce unprecedented
challenges in testing and reliability assurance. Traditional browser extension
testing approaches fail to address the non-deterministic behavior,
context-sensitivity, and complex web environment integration inherent to
LLM-powered extensions. Similarly, existing LLM testing methodologies operate
in isolation from browser-specific contexts, creating a critical gap in
effective evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present ASSURE, a
modular automated testing framework specifically designed for AI-powered
browser extensions. ASSURE comprises three principal components: (1) a modular
test case generation engine that supports plugin-based extension of testing
scenarios, (2) an automated execution framework that orchestrates the complex
interactions between web content, extension processing, and AI model behavior,
and (3) a configurable validation pipeline that systematically evaluates
behavioral consistency and security invariants rather than relying on exact
output matching. Our evaluation across six widely-used AI browser extensions
demonstrates ASSURE's effectiveness, identifying 531 distinct issues spanning
security vulnerabilities, metamorphic relation violations, and content
alignment problems. ASSURE achieves 6.4x improved testing throughput compared
to manual approaches, detecting critical security vulnerabilities within 12.4
minutes on average. This efficiency makes ASSURE practical for integration into
development pipelines, offering a comprehensive solution to the unique
challenges of testing AI-powered browser extensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线API文档多为非结构化HTML，手动转换耗时费力，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 通过结合大型语言模型和基于规则的算法，利用文档网页结构知识，构建转换管道。

Result: 实验表明，OASBuilder能处理数百种API，生成有效的OpenAPI规范，覆盖大部分原始文档信息。

Conclusion: OASBuilder在企业环境中成功应用，节省了大量手动时间，使复杂API更易于LLM使用。

Abstract: AI agents and business automation tools interacting with external web
services require standardized, machine-readable information about their APIs in
the form of API specifications. However, the information about APIs available
online is often presented as unstructured, free-form HTML documentation,
requiring external users to spend significant time manually converting it into
a structured format. To address this, we introduce OASBuilder, a novel
framework that transforms long and diverse API documentation pages into
consistent, machine-readable API specifications. This is achieved through a
carefully crafted pipeline that integrates large language models and rule-based
algorithms which are guided by domain knowledge of the structure of
documentation webpages. Our experiments demonstrate that OASBuilder generalizes
well across hundreds of APIs, and produces valid OpenAPI specifications that
encapsulate most of the information from the original documentation. OASBuilder
has been successfully implemented in an enterprise environment, saving
thousands of hours of manual effort and making hundreds of complex enterprise
APIs accessible as tools for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非技术用户在理解形式化验证结果时的困难，提高规范需求获取和验证的效率。

Method: 使用大语言模型（LLMs）将模型检查的反例转化为自然语言解释。

Result: SLEEC-LLM在两项实际案例中证明了其有效性，提升了非技术利益相关者的理解。

Conclusion: SLEEC-LLM显著改善了规范需求的获取和一致性分析过程，使其更高效且易于理解。

Abstract: Normative requirements specify social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and
cultural (SLEEC) norms that must be observed by a system. To support the
identification of SLEEC requirements, numerous standards and regulations have
been developed. These requirements are typically defined by stakeholders in the
non-technical system with diverse expertise (e.g., ethicists, lawyers, social
scientists). Hence, ensuring their consistency and managing the requirement
elicitation process are complex and error-prone tasks. Recent research has
addressed this challenge using domain-specific languages to specify normative
requirements as rules, whose consistency can then be analyzed with formal
methods. Nevertheless, these approaches often present the results from formal
verification tools in a way that is inaccessible to non-technical users. This
hinders understanding and makes the iterative process of eliciting and
validating these requirements inefficient in terms of both time and effort. To
address this problem, we introduce SLEEC-LLM, a tool that uses large language
models (LLMs) to provide natural-language interpretations for model-checking
counterexamples corresponding to SLEEC rule inconsistencies. SLEEC-LLM improves
the efficiency and explainability of normative requirements elicitation and
consistency analysis. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we summarise its use in
two real-world case studies involving non-technical stakeholders.

Conclusion: 研究为LLM健壮性测试提供了优化方法和搜索解决方案的见解，MOEA/D算法和组合扰动扩展测试空间是主要贡献。

Abstract: Assessing the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
robustness, has garnered significant attention. Recently, metamorphic testing
that defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate
the robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing
still requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization
of selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically
generating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally,
most studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in
their evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based
approach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and
minimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the
combinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in
the robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented
four search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel
encoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We
conducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a
random search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks. Our
statistical and empirical investigation revealed two key findings: (1) the
MOEA/D algorithm performed the best in optimizing the MR space for LLM
robustness testing, and (2) we identified silver bullet MRs for the LLM
robustness testing, which demonstrated dominant capabilities in confusing LLMs
across different Text-to-Text tasks. In LLM robustness assessment, our research
sheds light on the fundamental problem for optimized testing and provides
insights into search-based solutions.

### [210] [TigAug: Data Augmentation for Testing Traffic Light Detection in Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05932)
*You Lu,Dingji Wang,Kaifeng Huang,Bihuan Chen,Xin Peng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出TigAug方法，通过自动增强标记的交通灯图像来测试和改进ADS中的交通灯检测模型，解决了手动数据收集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于手动收集和标记交通灯数据效率低下且难以覆盖多样环境，需要一种自动化的方法来增强数据并测试模型的可靠性。

Method: 构建了两类变形关系和三类变换，基于天气、相机和交通灯特性的系统理解，通过增强图像检测模型错误并改进性能。

Result: 实验表明TigAug能有效测试模型、高效合成图像，且生成图像自然度可接受。

Conclusion: TigAug为交通灯检测模型的测试和性能提升提供了自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle technology has been developed in the last decades with
recent advances in sensing and computing technology. There is an urgent need to
ensure the reliability and robustness of autonomous driving systems (ADSs).
Despite the recent achievements in testing various ADS modules, little
attention has been paid on the automated testing of traffic light detection
models in ADSs. A common practice is to manually collect and label traffic
light data. However, it is labor-intensive, and even impossible to collect
diverse data under different driving environments.
  To address these problems, we propose and implement TigAug to automatically
augment labeled traffic light images for testing traffic light detection models
in ADSs. We construct two families of metamorphic relations and three families
of transformations based on a systematic understanding of weather environments,
camera properties, and traffic light properties. We use augmented images to
detect erroneous behaviors of traffic light detection models by
transformation-specific metamorphic relations, and to improve the performance
of traffic light detection models by retraining. Large-scale experiments with
four state-of-the-art traffic light detection models and two traffic light
datasets have demonstrated that i) TigAug is effective in testing traffic light
detection models, ii) TigAug is efficient in synthesizing traffic light images,
and iii) TigAug generates traffic light images with acceptable naturalness.

### [211] [Multi-Agent Debate Strategies to Enhance Requirements Engineering with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05981)
*Marc Oriol,Quim Motger,Jordi Marco,Xavier Franch*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过多智能体辩论（MAD）策略提升大型语言模型（LLM）在需求工程（RE）任务中的准确性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如提示工程、模型微调）将LLM视为孤立黑箱，缺乏迭代优化和协作，限制了其鲁棒性。受人类辩论启发，研究MAD是否能通过多智能体协作提升RE任务表现。

Method: 系统研究现有MAD策略，构建分类框架，并初步测试其在RE分类任务中的可行性。

Result: 研究总结了MAD策略的分类学，初步验证了MAD在RE分类中的有效性。

Conclusion: MAD为提升LLM在RE任务中的准确性提供了新思路，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Context: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are becoming widely used for
various Requirements Engineering (RE) tasks. Research on improving their
accuracy mainly focuses on prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and retrieval
augmented generation. However, these methods often treat models as isolated
black boxes - relying on single-pass outputs without iterative refinement or
collaboration, limiting robustness and adaptability. Objective: We propose
that, just as human debates enhance accuracy and reduce bias in RE tasks by
incorporating diverse perspectives, different LLM agents debating and
collaborating may achieve similar improvements. Our goal is to investigate
whether Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) strategies can enhance RE performance. Method:
We conducted a systematic study of existing MAD strategies across various
domains to identify their key characteristics. To assess their applicability in
RE, we implemented and tested a preliminary MAD-based framework for RE
classification. Results: Our study identified and categorized several MAD
strategies, leading to a taxonomy outlining their core attributes. Our
preliminary evaluation demonstrated the feasibility of applying MAD to RE
classification. Conclusions: MAD presents a promising approach for improving
LLM accuracy in RE tasks. This study provides a foundational understanding of
MAD strategies, offering insights for future research and refinements in RE
applications.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PromiseTune通过因果推断净化规则，指导配置调优，显著提升性能并增强结果可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件系统的高可配置性使配置调优成为保证性能的关键步骤，但现有调优工具在探索与利用之间难以平衡，且缺乏对潜在优化区域的了解。

Method: 提出PromiseTune，通过学习反映配置景观区域的规则，并用因果推断净化这些规则，以界定调优范围并强调潜在优化区域。

Result: 在12个系统和不同预算下，PromiseTune显著优于其他11种先进调优工具，性能排名高出42%，并提供更丰富的系统特性解释。

Conclusion: PromiseTune通过因果规则净化有效解决了探索与利用的权衡问题，提升了调优效果和可解释性。

Abstract: The high configurability of modern software systems has made configuration
tuning a crucial step for assuring system performance, e.g., latency or
throughput. However, given the expensive measurements, large configuration
space, and rugged configuration landscape, existing tuners suffer
ineffectiveness due to the difficult balance of budget utilization between
exploring uncertain regions (for escaping from local optima) and exploiting
guidance of known good configurations (for fast convergence). The root cause is
that we lack knowledge of where the promising regions lay, which also causes
challenges in the explainability of the results.
  In this paper, we propose PromiseTune that tunes configuration guided by
causally purified rules. PromiseTune is unique in the sense that we learn
rules, which reflect certain regions in the configuration landscape, and purify
them with causal inference. The remaining rules serve as approximated
reflections of the promising regions, bounding the tuning to emphasize these
places in the landscape. This, as we demonstrate, can effectively mitigate the
impact of the exploration and exploitation trade-off. Those purified regions
can then be paired with the measured configurations to provide spatial
explainability at the landscape level. Comparing with 11 state-of-the-art
tuners on 12 systems and varying budgets, we show that PromiseTune performs
significantly better than the others with $42\%$ superior rank to the overall
second best while providing richer information to explain the hidden system
characteristics.

### [213] [Model Cards Revisited: Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice for Ethical AI Requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06014)
*Tim Puhlfürß,Julia Butzke,Walid Maalej*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文分析了AI模型文档（模型卡）的现状，发现开发者主要关注模型能力和可靠性，而忽略了其他伦理要求（如可解释性、用户自主性和公平性）。通过分析26份伦理指南、3个文档框架和10个模型卡，提出了包含43项伦理要求的分类法，为改进模型卡框架提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型文档实践未能充分满足伦理要求，存在与法律、指南和标准的差距。研究旨在理解这一差距并提供改进指导。

Method: 对26份伦理与AI指南、3个AI文档框架、3项模型卡定量研究和10个实际模型卡进行主题分析，识别并分类43项伦理要求。

Result: 发现模型开发者主要关注模型能力和可靠性，忽视其他伦理方面。提出包含4个主题和12个子主题的分类法。

Conclusion: 需要加强AI伦理文档支持，分类法为改进模型卡框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Model cards are the primary documentation framework for developers of
artificial intelligence (AI) models to communicate critical information to
their users. Those users are often developers themselves looking for relevant
documentation to ensure that their AI systems comply with the ethical
requirements of existing laws, guidelines, and standards. Recent studies
indicate inadequate model documentation practices, suggesting a gap between AI
requirements and current practices in model documentation. To understand this
gap and provide actionable guidance to bridge it, we conducted a thematic
analysis of 26 guidelines on ethics and AI, three AI documentation frameworks,
three quantitative studies of model cards, and ten actual model cards. We
identified a total of 43 ethical requirements relevant to model documentation
and organized them into a taxonomy featuring four themes and twelve sub-themes
representing ethical principles. Our findings indicate that model developers
predominantly emphasize model capabilities and reliability in the documentation
while overlooking other ethical aspects, such as explainability, user autonomy,
and fairness. This underscores the need for enhanced support in documenting
ethical AI considerations. Our taxonomy serves as a foundation for a revised
model card framework that holistically addresses ethical AI requirements.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 研究探讨了iShares Asia 50 ETF（AIA）的市场波动与经济及市场情绪指标的关系，发现波动与情绪关联在高、低波动状态下差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究经济不确定性时期AIA波动与美、中及全球经济政策不确定性指数的关联。

Method: 采用GARCH-MIDAS模型、马尔可夫链（MSR）和分位数回归（QR）分析波动与情绪的机制依赖性。

Result: 高、低波动状态下投资者对市场不确定性的反应差异显著，短期波动与情绪指标关联较弱。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了市场波动与情绪指标的复杂关系，为投资者和政策制定者提供了实用见解。

Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between the market volatility of the
iShares Asia 50 ETF (AIA) and economic and market sentiment indicators from the
United States, China, and globally during periods of economic uncertainty.
Specifically, it examines the association between AIA volatility and key
indicators such as the US Economic Uncertainty Index (ECU), the US Economic
Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU), China's Economic Policy Uncertainty Index
(EPUCH), the Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (GEPU), and the Chicago
Board Options Exchange's Volatility Index (VIX), spanning the years 2007 to
2023. Employing methodologies such as the two-covariate GARCH-MIDAS model,
regime-switching Markov Chain (MSR), and quantile regressions (QR), the study
explores the regime-dependent dynamics between AIA volatility and
economic/market sentiment, taking into account investors' sensitivity to market
uncertainties across different regimes. The findings reveal that the
relationship between realized volatility and sentiment varies significantly
between high- and low-volatility regimes, reflecting differences in investors'
responses to market uncertainties under these conditions. Additionally, a weak
association is observed between short-term volatility and economic/market
sentiment indicators, suggesting that these indicators may have limited
predictive power, especially during high-volatility regimes. The QR results
further demonstrate the robustness of MSR estimates across most quantiles.
Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay
between market volatility and economic/market sentiment, offering practical
implications for investors and policymakers.

*Davit Gondauri*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于Navier-Stokes方程的数学模型，用于定量评估、预测和模拟流动性流动与系统性风险，结合了13个宏观经济参数，并通过实证测试验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型（如CAPM、VaR、GARCH）难以反映真实市场波动和极端事件，因此需要一种更有效的工具来管理流动性和系统性风险。

Method: 采用Navier-Stokes方程构建模型，结合13个宏观经济参数，运用计量经济学测试、傅里叶分析、随机模拟和AI校准等方法进行动态测试与预测。

Result: 模型能有效描述流动性动态、系统性风险及极端情景，为多因素分析、危机预测和逆周期政策规划提供了稳健框架。

Conclusion: 该模型为现代经济系统提供了一种创新的工具，有助于提升系统性韧性和流动性管理能力。

Abstract: Modern economic systems face unprecedented socioeconomic challenges, making
systemic resilience and effective liquidity flow management essential.
Traditional models such as CAPM, VaR, and GARCH often fail to reflect real
market fluctuations and extreme events. This study develops and validates an
innovative mathematical model based on the Navier-Stokes equations, aimed at
the quantitative assessment, forecasting, and simulation of liquidity flows and
systemic risks. The model incorporates 13 macroeconomic and financial
parameters, including liquidity velocity, market pressure, internal stress,
stochastic fluctuations, and risk premiums, all based on real data and formally
included in the modified equation. The methodology employs econometric testing,
Fourier analysis, stochastic simulation, and AI-based calibration to enable
dynamic testing and forecasting. Simulation-based sensitivity analysis
evaluates the impact of parameter changes on financial balance. The model is
empirically tested using Georgian macroeconomic and financial data from
2010-2024, including GDP, inflation, the Gini index, CDS spreads, and LCR
metrics. Results show that the model effectively describes liquidity dynamics,
systemic risk, and extreme scenarios, while also offering a robust framework
for multifactorial analysis, crisis prediction, and countercyclical policy
planning.

Motivation: MBS投资者面临现金流报告延迟带来的价值不确定性，现代金融科技工具（如资产代币化、智能合约和DAO）可能提供解决方案。

Method: 利用ACTUS标准逻辑表达MBS合约，并在公共区块链上实现，以支持实时评级系统。

Result: 提出了一种MBS-DAO的算法设计框架，整合抵押贷款、房地产资产和贷款担保。

Conclusion: MBS-DAO设计有望提高市场效率，增强透明度和可追溯性。

Abstract: Can the general structure of a mortgage-backed security (MBS) contract be
programmatically represented through the use of decentralized autonomous
organizations (DAOs)? Such an approach could allow for the portfolio of loans
to be managed by investors in a trustless and transparent way. The focus and
scope of this paper is to explore the potential for applying the tools of
modern fintech, such as asset tokenization, smart contracts, and DAOs, to
reconstruct traditional structured products that have a greater degree of
transparency and traceability. MBS investors face considerable value
uncertainty as time increases between the actual occurrence (or non-occurrence)
of cash flows and subsequent reporting. Given that an MBS is a financial
contract, it should be expressible logically using the Algorithmic Contract
Types Unified Standards (ACTUS). Since each underlying mortgage in an MBS
derives its cash flows in a prescribed way over the life of the contract,
implementation on a public blockchain could enable real-time ratings systems,
improving market efficiency. We explore the potential for creating formal
algorithmic designs of MBS-DAOs that incorporate individual mortgages, the
underlying real estate assets (collateral), and any loan guarantees.

TL;DR: 研究发现，企业社会责任（CSR）活动提升企业形象，显著增加消费者对产品的偏好和销量。以韩国方便面市场为例，Ottogi的CSR活动使其年销量平均增长6.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨企业社会责任活动如何通过塑造企业形象影响消费者选择和销售表现。

Method: 利用媒体曝光度构建企业社会责任活动的评分，分析其对消费者效用和销量的影响。

Result: Ottogi的CSR活动使其年销量平均增长23.7百万包（6.7%），效果相当于广告支出增加近60%。

Conclusion: CSR活动可通过提升企业形象促进销量增长，对企业发展具有显著价值。

Abstract: This paper empirically examines the extent to which a favorable view of a
firm, shaped by its social contributions, influences consumer choices and firm
sales. Using a favorability rating that reflects media exposure of each firm's
corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities in the Korean instant noodles
market during the 2010s, we find evidence that improvements in the corporate
image of Ottogi - one of the country's largest instant noodle producers -
positively affected consumer utility for the firm's products. Notably, Ottogi's
annual sales of its major brands increased by an average of 23.7 million
packages, or 6.7%, as a result of CSR activities and the associated rise in
consumer favorability. This effect is comparable in magnitude to that of a
nearly 60% increase in advertising spending. Our findings suggest that CSR can
foster firm growth by boosting product sales.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于职业的技能多样性和质量来估算经济复杂性的方法，称为“隐藏复杂性”，与传统基于经济输出的“显性复杂性”形成对比。该方法与工资水平和劳动生产率增长正相关，而传统方法则无此关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经济复杂性通常通过经济输出来衡量，但能力本身不可观测，因此需要一种更直接的方法来估算行业和地区的技能禀赋。

Method: 通过量化特定行业所需职业的技能多样性和质量来估算隐藏复杂性，并与传统的显性复杂性（基于出口或生产）进行对比。

Result: 隐藏复杂性与工资水平和劳动生产率增长正相关，而显性复杂性则无此关联。

Conclusion: 基于职业的技能评估方法为经济复杂性提供了新的视角，并展示了其在经济增长分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Economic complexity measures aim to quantify the capability content or
endowment of industries and territories; however, capabilities are not
observable, and therefore cannot be directly used in the computations. We
estimate such endowments by quantifying the quality and diversity of the skills
in the occupations required in specific industries. We refer to this job-based
assessment as the hidden complexity, in contrast with the usual revealed
complexity, which is computed from economic outputs such as exports or
production. We show that our job-based measure of complexity is positively
associated to wage levels and labor productivity growth, whereas the classic
revealed measure is not. Finally, we discuss the application of these methods
at the territorial level, showing their connection with economic growth.

Motivation: 探讨外汇储备与GDP及军费支出的关系，并分析人民币在全球外汇储备中的趋势。

Method: 使用岭回归和Lasso回归分析数据，建立复杂的地缘政治网络模型。

Result: 军费支出比GDP更能解释外汇储备；人民币正逐步接近西方外汇储备平衡。

Conclusion: 人民币与西方外汇储备可能在15至40年内达到新平衡，取决于地缘政治和经济因素。

Abstract: We show that the amount of foreign exchange reserves (FER) in the world in a
given currency is highly correlated with the GDP and military spending of that
country for a set of western economies during the last 20 years. Taking into
account multicollinearity, Ridge and Lasso regressions reveal that the Foreign
Exchange Reserve is better explained by military spending than GDP for seven
western currencies. For each year shown, military spending is statistically
significant more than the monetary instrument M2. Comparing the currency of the
second world economy, the Chinese renminbi, is well beyond the western FER
equilibrium, but yearly analysis shows that there is a steady trend towards a
new FER balance. Next, we define a complex geopolitical network model in which
the probability of switching to an alternative FER currency depends both on
economic and political factors. Military spending is introduced into the model
as an average share of GDP observed within the data. As the GDP of a particular
country grows, so does the military power of a country. The nature of the
creation of new currency networks initially depends only on geopolitical
allegiance. As the volume of trade with a particular country changes over a
designated threshold, a country switches to the currency of that country due to
increased trade. If the current steady trend continues within the same
geopolitical setting as in the past twenty years, we extrapolate that the RMB
and Western currencies could reach a new FER balance within 15 to 40 years,
depending on the model setup.

Abstract: We study $k$-price auctions in a complete information environment and
characterize all pure-strategy Nash equilibrium outcomes. In a setting with $n$
agents having ordered valuations, we show that any agent, except those with the

welfare increases monotonically as we go from $k=2$ (second-price auction) to
$k=n$ (lowest-price auction), with the first-price auction achieving the
highest worst-case welfare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法捕捉多维偏好中因冲突标准导致的不完全可比性。

Result: 该框架能直观且理论严谨地建模多维偏好，支持不完全可比情况下的权衡分析。

Conclusion: 提出的方法扩展了现有表示，为多维不完全偏好提供了更灵活和严谨的工具。

Abstract: In this paper, I propose a new framework for representing multidimensional
incomplete preferences through zonotope-valued utilities, addressing the
shortcomings of traditional scalar and vector-based models in decision theory.
Traditional approaches assign single numerical values to alternatives, failing
to capture the complexity of preferences where alternatives remainmain
incomparable due to conflicting criteria across multiple dimensions. Our method
maps each alternative to a zonotope, a convex geometric object in
\(\mathbb{R}^m\) formed by Minkowski sums of intervals, which encapsulates the
multidimensional structure of preferences with mathematical rigor. The
set-valued nature of these payoffs stems from multiple sources, including
non-probabilistic uncertainty, such as imprecise utility evaluation due to
incomplete information about criteria weights, and probabilistic uncertainty
arising from stochastic decision environments. By decomposing preference
relations into interval orders and utilizing an extended set difference
operator, we establish a rigorous axiomatization that defines preference as one
alternative's zonotope differing from another's within the non-negative orthant
of \(\mathbb{R}^m\). This framework generalizes existing representations and
provides a visually intuitive and theoretically robust tool for modeling
trade-offs among each dimension, while preferences are incomparable.

Result: 在动态多代理匹配环境中，稳定且高效的结果是可能的。

Conclusion: 为复杂匹配过程的动态演变及其有效管理提供了深入理解。

Abstract: This paper explores a novel extension of dynamic matching theory by analyzing
a three-way matching problem involving agents from three distinct populations,
each with two possible types. Unlike traditional static or two-way dynamic
models, our setting captures more complex team-formation environments where one
agent from each of the three populations must be matched to form a valid team.
We consider two preference structures: assortative or homophilic, where agents
prefer to be matched with others of the same type, and dis-assortative or
heterophilic, where diversity within the team is valued. Agents arrive
sequentially and face a trade-off between matching immediately or waiting for a
higher quality match in the future albeit with a waiting cost. We construct and
analyze the corresponding transition probability matrices for each preference
regime and demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of stationary
distributions. Our results show that stable and efficient outcomes can arise in
dynamic, multi-agent matching environments, offering a deeper understanding of
how complex matching processes evolve over time and how they can be effectively
managed.

We provide an equivalent\ncharacterization of the DiD potential outcome model using sequential\nconditional moment restrictions on observables, which shows that the DiD\nidentification assumptions typically imply nonparametric overidentification\nrestrictions. We derive the semiparametric efficient influence function (EIF)\nin closed form for DiD and ES causal parameters under commonly imposed parallel\ntrends assumptions. The EIF is automatically Neyman orthogonal and yields the\nsmallest variance among all asymptotically normal, regular estimators of the\nDiD and ES parameters. Leveraging the EIF, we propose simple-to-compute\nefficient estimators. Our results highlight how to optimally explore different\npre-treatment periods and comparison groups to obtain the tightest (asymptotic)\nconfidence intervals, offering practical tools for improving inference in\nmodern DiD and ES applications even in small samples. Calibrated simulations\nand an empirical application demonstrate substantial precision gains of our\nefficient estimators in finite samples."}

In a parallel stream, choice models in cognitive\npsychology have focused on modelling the decision-making process, but typically\nin controlled scenarios. Recent research developments have attempted to bridge\nthe modelling paradigms, with choice models that are based on psychological\nfoundations, such as decision field theory (DFT), outperforming traditional\neconometric choice models for travel mode and route choice behaviour. The use\nof physiological data, which can provide indications about the choice-making\nprocess and mental states, opens up the opportunity to further advance the\nmodels. In particular, the use of such data to enrich 'process' parameters\nwithin a cognitive theory-driven choice model has not yet been explored.

This paper\nintroduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework\ndesigned to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in\nMAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic\nvoting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the\nrelevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational\ncontext; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing\nimportance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different\ntime horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based\nconsensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items\nare agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in\nthe presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N\ngreater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient\ninter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage\nand similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata.

Context is derived by aggregating and\ninferring from dynamic IoT data, making it highly volatile and posing\nchallenges in maintaining freshness and real-time accessibility. Caching is a\npotential solution, but traditional policies struggle with the transient nature\nof context in IoT (e.g., ensuring real-time access for frequent queries or\nhandling fast-changing data). To address this, we propose the Dynamic Context\nMonitoring Framework (DCMF) to enhance context caching in Context Management\nPlatforms (CMPs) by dynamically evaluating and managing context. DCMF comprises\ntwo core components: the Context Evaluation Engine (CEE) and the Context\nManagement Module (CMM). The CEE calculates the Probability of Access (PoA)\nusing parameters such as Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Context (QoC),\nCost of Context (CoC), timeliness, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs),\nassigning weights to assess access likelihood. Based on this, the CMM applies a\nhybrid Dempster-Shafer approach to manage Context Freshness (CF), updating\nbelief levels and confidence scores to determine whether to cache, evict, or\nrefresh context items. We implemented DCMF in a Context-as-a-Service (CoaaS)\nplatform and evaluated it using real-world smart city data, particularly\ntraffic and roadwork scenarios.

Caching is a\npotential solution, but traditional policies struggle with the transient nature\nof context in IoT (e.g., ensuring real-time access for frequent queries or\nhandling fast-changing data). To address this, we propose the Dynamic Context\nMonitoring Framework (DCMF) to enhance context caching in Context Management\nPlatforms (CMPs) by dynamically evaluating and managing context. DCMF comprises\ntwo core components: the Context Evaluation Engine (CEE) and the Context\nManagement Module (CMM).

Based on this, the CMM applies a\nhybrid Dempster-Shafer approach to manage Context Freshness (CF), updating\nbelief levels and confidence scores to determine whether to cache, evict, or\nrefresh context items. We implemented DCMF in a Context-as-a-Service (CoaaS)\nplatform and evaluated it using real-world smart city data, particularly\ntraffic and roadwork scenarios.

In contrast,\nsimple, lossless models fail to accurately represent complex behavior and\nprovide no further runtime advantage."}

While\nspecialized network infrastructure (e.g., time-sensitive networking (TSN)\nswitches) provides deterministic data transport across the network, achieving\nstrict end-to-end timing guarantees requires equally capable end devices to\nsupport deterministic traffic. These end devices, however, often employ\ngeneral-purpose computing platforms like standard PCs, which lack native\nsupport for deterministic traffic and suffer from unpredictable delays\nintroduced by their software stack and system architecture. Although\nspecialized NICs with hardware scheduling offload can mitigate this problem,\nthe limited compatibility hinders their widespread adoption, particularly for\ncost-sensitive applications or in legacy devices.\n  To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel software-based driver model,\nnamely KeepON, to enable the support of deterministic packet transmissions on\nend devices equipped with standard NICs. The key idea of KeepON is to have the\nNIC keep on transmitting fixed-size data chunks as placeholders, thereby\nmaintaining a predictable temporal transmission pattern. The real-time packets\ngenerated by the mission-critical application(s) will then be precisely\ninserted into this stream by replacing placeholders at the designated position\nto ensure their accurate transmission time. We implement and evaluate KeepON by\nmodifying the network driver on a Raspberry Pi using its standard NIC.

Research efforts have been dedicated\nto improving different aspects of FL, such as algorithm improvement, resource\nallocation, and client selection, to enable its deployment in distributed edge\nnetworks for practical applications. One of the reasons for the poor FL model\nperformance is due to the worker dropout during training as the FL server may\nbe located far away from the FL workers. To address this issue, an Hierarchical\nFederated Learning (HFL) framework has been introduced, incorporating an\nadditional layer of edge servers to relay communication between the FL server\nand workers. While the HFL framework improves the communication between the FL\nserver and workers, large number of communication rounds may still be required\nfor model convergence, particularly when FL workers have non-independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) data. Moreover, the FL workers are assumed to\nfully cooperate in the FL training process, which may not always be true in\npractical situations. To overcome these challenges, we propose a\nsynthetic-data-empowered HFL framework that mitigates the statistical issues\narising from non-IID local datasets while also incentivizing FL worker\nparticipation. In our proposed framework, the edge servers reward the FL\nworkers in their clusters for facilitating the FL training process. To improve\nthe performance of the FL model given the non-IID local datasets of the FL\nworkers, the edge servers generate and distribute synthetic datasets to FL\nworkers within their clusters.

We propose a novel\nmultimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event\ncameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high\ntemporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural\nNetwork and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB\nimages. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and\nspatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly\ndetection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach\noutperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving\nmillisecond-level real-time performance."}

Probing analyses show that accent strength is\nbest predicted by a subset of the segment's pretrained representation features,\nin which perceptually salient phonological features that contrast the expected\nAmerican English and realized non-native English segments are given prominent\nweighting. A multinomial logistic regression of pretrained representation-based\nsegment distances from American and Indian English baselines on accent ratings\nreveals strong associations between the odds of accent strength and distances\nfrom the baselines, in the expected directions.

We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to\nreason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by\npairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding\npipeline.

Notably, the\n\"gibberish\" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt\noptimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM\nalignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is\nnon-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms\nfail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we\npropose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an\nevolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning\nstrategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent\ncomplexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in\nresponse to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines\nunconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens\npresent within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across\nclassification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning\ntasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency.

A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain\nsynchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or\ninconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper\nintroduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework\ndesigned to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in\nMAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic\nvoting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the\nrelevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational\ncontext; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing\nimportance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different\ntime horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based\nconsensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items\nare agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in\nthe presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N\ngreater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient\ninter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage\nand similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations\nin a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's\nefficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%\nvoting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a\n92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an\n82% cache hit rate for memory access."}

These benchmarks evaluate the performance of LLMs on specific\ncode-related tasks, such as code understanding and generation. A critical step\nin constructing code benchmarks is the design of prompts. However, as existing\ncode benchmarks typically rely on a single prompt template per task, they are\nprone to the issue of prompt sensitivity, where minor prompt variations could\nresult in substantial performance variations, leading to unreliable evaluations\nof model capabilities.\n  While previous studies have explored prompt sensitivity, their experimental\ndesigns and findings are limited to traditional natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present an empirical study to investigate prompt\nsensitivity in code benchmarks. We first propose a general framework that\nmodifies prompt templates in a manner that preserves both their semantics and\ntheir structure as much as possible. Based on the framework, we conduct\nextensive experiments across eight code benchmark tasks on 10 representative\nopen-source LLMs, with each task featuring 100 semantically similar prompt\ntemplates. We then analyze the evaluation results using various statistical\nmetrics, focusing on both absolute and relative model performance. Our findings\nsuggest that even slight prompt variations can lead to significant shifts in\nperformance. Additionally, we observe that such variations can introduce\ninconsistencies in the performance rankings across different models.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity."}

This is mainly achieved by refining approaches to\nprocessing and integrating non-textual elements in PDFs into the RAG framework\nto derive precise and relevant answers, as well as fine-tuning large language\nmodels to better adapt to our system. We provide an in-depth experimental\nevaluation of our solution, demonstrating its capability to extract accurate\ninformation that can be applied to different types of content across PDFs. This\nwork not only pushes the boundaries of retrieval-augmented QA systems but also\nlays a foundation for further research in multimodal data integration and\nprocessing."}

Soil samples were photographed in a standardized top-view\nposition with a resolution of 45 MP and a minimum scale of 39.4 micrometers per\npixel, both in their moist and dry states. A custom test bench employing 13x9\ninch white aluminum trays, on which the samples are spread in a thin layer, was\nused. For samples exceeding a size limit, a coning and quartering method was\nemployed for mass reduction."}

In\norder to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under\nundesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,\nit is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low\nframe rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based\nforeground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures\nscattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex\noptimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general\nfeatures, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of\nnoise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and\ngeneral features to accurately separate the components from various types of\nnoise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization\nproblem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex\nsubproblems by newly established algorithms.

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions.

In this work, we propose a stain\nnormalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color\ndiscrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and\nvector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the\ntarget color features, and decoding the stained structure features to\nnormalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by\ndifferent images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this\nassumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color\nfeatures will map.

However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field\noverwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To\nfulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,\nefficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and\ndata quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ\nlayer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework\naims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a\ncase study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that\npartially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8\nobject detection task performance.

This raises a\ncritical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and\ntransferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?\n  To answer this, we make two key contributions.

A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation\nacross 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,\nreveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.\nInterestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather\nthan pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks.

To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models.

Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs.

Under this\nassumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color\nfeatures will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention\nmechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color\n(decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of\nstain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to\nselect a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we\nvalidate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection\nalgorithm.

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for\nfuture work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,\nand progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by\ntraining on formal constitutional principles."}

In this work,\nthe network dynamism is governed by an oblivious adversary that controls which\nnodes join and leave the system in each round. The adversary has full knowledge\nof the system and unbounded computational power, but cannot see the random\nchoices made by the protocol. Our analysis builds on the framework of Augustine\net al.

An SVM is also trained on this\nrepresentation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas,\ndemonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned\nlatent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with\nthe spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful\nindicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical\napplicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and\nenhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable\ndecision-making."}

Aggregating feedback into a single reward model risks\ndisproportionately suppressing minority preferences. To address this, we\npresent a novel reward modeling approach for learning individualized reward\nmodels. Our approach uses a language model to guide users through reflective\ndialogues where they critique agent behavior and construct their preferences.\nThis personalized dialogue history, containing the user's reflections and\ncritiqued examples, is then used as context for another language model that\nserves as an individualized reward function (what we call a \"verbal reward\nmodel\") for evaluating new trajectories.

While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers\nsignificantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher\nmodel tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision\nfor tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation\n(LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by\nreformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and\nintra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction\ndistributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail),\nrespectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources\nof teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group\nloss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform\nintra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during\ndistillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and\nImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods,\nachieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class\nperformance.

To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF.

In\nthis work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely\nfrom scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality\ntext generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a\nbase model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that\nfacilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support\nthis, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved\nlength control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental\nevaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,\nconsistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,\nachieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and\nArena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and\nQwen3-235B.

The concept of\nrevocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme\nis revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme\nrevoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the\nindividual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition\npower. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust\nrevocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and\ntraining set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face\nmatcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)\nstrongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power\nextends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have\nthe same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the\nmodels can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The\nbiometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible\nthat the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is\ntypically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different\npersons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value\nin attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor\ntemplate. We also explore the feasibility of using a Vision Transformer (ViT)\nbackbone-based face matcher in the revocable biometric system proposed in this\nwork and demonstrate that it is less suitable compared to typical ResNet-based\ndeep CNN backbones."}

Inspired by these principles,\nFilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which\ntransforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage\nwhich transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual\nand auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a\nMulti-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in\ngenerating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a\nvast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates\nprofessional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm\nControl module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by\nsimulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements\nto achieve engaging content.

In particular,\nreachability analysis is increasingly used in Open-Source Software (OSS)\nprojects to identify reachable vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) through call\ngraphs, enabling a focus on exploitable risks. Performing reachability analysis\ntypically requires the vulnerable function (VF) to track the call chains from\ndownstream applications. However, such crucial information is usually\nunavailable in modern vulnerability databases like NVD. While directly\nextracting VF from modified functions in vulnerability patches is intuitive,\npatches are not always available. Moreover, our preliminary study shows that\nover 26% of VF do not exist in the modified functions. Meanwhile, simply\nignoring patches to search vulnerable functions suffers from overwhelming\nnoises and lexical gaps between descriptions and source code.

By implementing a large-scale comparative analysis involving a\ndiverse selection of pretrained models, including general-purpose architectures\npretrained on large-scale datasets such as CLIP and DINOv2, to\nbiomedical-specific models like MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, and PubMedCLIP, we\nrigorously assess each model's capacity to effectively adapt and generalize to\nprognosis tasks, particularly under conditions of severe data scarcity and\npronounced class imbalance. The benchmark was designed to capture critical\nconditions common in prognosis tasks, including variations in dataset size and\nclass distribution, providing detailed insights into the strengths and\nlimitations of each fine-tuning strategy. This extensive and structured\nevaluation aims to inform the practical deployment and adoption of robust,\nefficient, and generalizable AI-driven solutions in real-world clinical\nprognosis prediction workflows."}

Most existing\nhyperbolic learning methods use fixed distance measures for all data, assuming\na uniform hierarchy across all data points.

In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware distance measure in\nhyperbolic spaces, which dynamically adapts to varying hierarchical structures.\nOur approach derives the distance measure by generating tailored projections\nand curvatures for each pair of data points, effectively mapping them to an\nappropriate hyperbolic space. We introduce a revised low-rank decomposition\nscheme and a hard-pair mining mechanism to mitigate the computational cost of\npair-wise distance computation without compromising accuracy. We present an\nupper bound on the low-rank approximation error using Talagrand's concentration\ninequality, ensuring theoretical robustness.

Existing encoder decoder based methods\ntypically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption\nthat the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of\nlogical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a\nparticular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal\nsemantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.\nThanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these\nabnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.\nThis ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with\nmisleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel\nnormality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly\ndetection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder\ndirectly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the\nreconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics\nof normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable\nsemantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of\nnormal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic\nfeatures are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the\nreconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality.

Prior work has largely centered on\nintra-group behavioral consistency in multi-agent systems, with limited\nattention given to behavioral consistency in multi-agent grouping scenarios. In\nthis paper, we introduce Dual-Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC), a novel MARL\ncontrol method designed to explicitly regulate agent behaviors at both\nintra-group and inter-group levels. DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups\nand dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these\ngroups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these\ngroups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group\nconsistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.\nSimultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral\nstrategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.\nCrucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad\napplicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in\nvarious grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly\nenhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task\nspecialization, yielding substantial performance improvements. DLBC provides\nnew ideas for behavioral consistency control of multi-intelligent body systems,\nand its potential for application in more complex tasks and dynamic\nenvironments can be further explored in the future."}

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for\nfuture work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,\nand progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by\ntraining on formal constitutional principles."}

Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses\nexisting multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater\ntraining efficiency.

However,\nexisting film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and\nthus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse\ncamera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and\nunengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end\nAI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for\nprofessional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard\noutputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography\nfrom extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,\naudience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,\nFilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which\ntransforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage\nwhich transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual\nand auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a\nMulti-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in\ngenerating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a\nvast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates\nprofessional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm\nControl module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by\nsimulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements\nto achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models\nlike (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive\nexperiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and\ncinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking."}

A central challenge in\nthis setting is maintaining visual consistency, particularly in how characters\nand objects persist and evolve throughout the story. Despite recent advances in\ndiffusion models, current approaches often fail to preserve key character\nattributes, leading to incoherent narratives. In this work, we propose a\ncollaborative multi-agent framework that autonomously identifies, corrects, and\nrefines inconsistencies across multi-panel story visualizations. The agents\noperate in an iterative loop, enabling fine-grained, panel-level updates\nwithout re-generating entire sequences. Our framework is model-agnostic and\nflexibly integrates with a variety of diffusion models, including rectified\nflow transformers such as Flux and latent diffusion models such as Stable\nDiffusion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method\noutperforms prior approaches in terms of multi-panel consistency."}

Unlike prior\nworks focused on game-style visuals, RealPlay aims to produce photorealistic,\ntemporally consistent video sequences that resemble real-world footage. It\noperates in an interactive loop: users observe a generated scene, issue a\ncontrol command, and receive a short video chunk in response. To enable such\nrealistic and responsive generation, we address key challenges including\niterative chunk-wise prediction for low-latency feedback, temporal consistency\nacross iterations, and accurate control response. RealPlay is trained on a\ncombination of labeled game data and unlabeled real-world videos, without\nrequiring real-world action annotations. Notably, we observe two forms of\ngeneralization: (1) control transfer-RealPlay effectively maps control signals\nfrom virtual to real-world scenarios; and (2) entity transfer-although training\nlabels originate solely from a car racing game, RealPlay generalizes to control\ndiverse real-world entities, including bicycles and pedestrians, beyond\nvehicles.

Similar results have previously been\nachieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally\nreconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video\ngenerators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene\ncoherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce\nSurfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by\nindexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they\nhave observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past\nviews when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our\nmethod produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction\nof the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our\napproach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate\nsuperior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene\ncoherence and camera control."}

In this paper, we propose\nTC-Light, a novel paradigm characterized by the proposed two-stage post\noptimization mechanism. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an\ninflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first\nstage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical\nvideo representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained\ntexture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate\nperformance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark.\nExtensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible\nrelighting results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.\nThe code and video demos are available at\nhttps://dekuliutesla.github.io/tclight/."}

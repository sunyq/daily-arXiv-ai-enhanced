### [1] [Fuzzy, Symbolic, and Contextual: Enhancing LLM Instruction via Cognitive Scaffolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21204)
*Vanessa Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了架构归纳偏置如何影响大语言模型在指导性对话中的认知行为，通过引入符号支架机制和短期记忆模式来促进结构化推理，实验表明完整系统在认知行为方面优于基线变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型架构中的归纳偏置如何影响其在苏格拉底式辅导中的认知行为，探索通过架构设计来塑造模型的教学策略。

Method: 引入符号支架机制和短期记忆模式，通过五个系统变体的控制消融实验，使用专家设计的评分标准和基于LLM的评估框架进行系统比较。

Result: 完整系统在所有认知行为指标上一致优于基线变体，移除记忆或符号结构会降低抽象、自适应探测和概念连续性等关键认知行为。

Conclusion: 架构支架能够可靠地塑造大语言模型中涌现的教学策略，支持处理层面的解释，表明架构设计对模型认知行为具有重要影响。

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

TL;DR: 评估GraphRAG在阿尔茨海默病领域的应用效果，比较其与标准GPT-4o的回答质量和可追溯性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学研究中面临幻觉、领域知识有限和缺乏可解释性等问题，GraphRAG作为改进方法在生物医学领域的研究还很有限

Method: 构建包含50篇论文和70个专家问题的阿尔茨海默病数据库，使用GPT-4o作为LLM，比较GraphRAG与标准GPT-4o的回答质量和可追溯性

Result: 研究评估了两种流行GraphRAG系统的质量和可追溯性，并提供了易于使用的界面供研究人员测试标准RAG和GraphRAG性能

Conclusion: GraphRAG在专业领域如阿尔茨海默病研究中具有潜力，但需要进一步评估和改进，研究为此提供了测试平台

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

### [4] [Multi-Ontology Integration with Dual-Axis Propagation for Medical Concept Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21320)
*Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi,Arya Hadizadeh Moghaddam,Dongjie Wang,Zijun Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINKO是一个基于大语言模型的集成本体学习框架，通过同时利用多个医学本体图谱，在异构本体系统内和跨系统进行双轴知识传播，以增强医学概念表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单一本体系统或多个孤立本体系统的知识整合，缺乏统一的学习结构，导致概念表示学习局限于本体内部关系，忽略了跨本体连接。

Method: 1) 使用LLM为ontology概念嵌入提供图检索增强的初始化；2) 通过双轴知识传播联合学习：a) 本体内部垂直传播，b) 本体间水平传播；3) 作为插件编码器与现有EHR预测模型兼容。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验验证了LINKO相对于最先进基线的优越性能，在数据有限和罕见疾病预测场景中表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LINKO框架通过整合多个ontology系统并实现跨本体知识传播，显著提升了医学概念表示学习的效果，为EHR预测模型提供了更好的编码器解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

### [5] [Think in Games: Learning to Reason in Games via Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21365)
*Yi Liao,Yu Gu,Yuan Sui,Zining Zhu,Yifan Lu,Guohua Tang,Zhongqian Sun,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TiG框架通过将强化学习决策重构为语言建模任务，让大语言模型在游戏环境中直接交互学习程序性知识，同时保持解释能力，显著降低了数据需求和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂推理任务表现出色但无法将静态知识转化为动态决策的问题，弥合陈述性知识和程序性知识之间的差距。

Method: 将基于强化学习的决策重新表述为语言建模任务：LLMs生成语言引导的策略，通过环境反馈的在线强化学习进行迭代优化。

Result: TiG成功弥合了陈述性和程序性知识之间的差距，以显著更低的数据和计算需求实现了与传统RL方法相竞争的性能，并提供逐步的自然语言解释。

Conclusion: TiG框架有效结合了LLMs的世界知识和推理能力与RL的交互学习优势，为复杂交互任务提供了透明且可解释的决策方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

### [6] [AHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21376)
*Tony Lee,Haoqin Tu,Chi Heem Wong,Zijun Wang,Siwei Yang,Yifan Mai,Yuyin Zhou,Cihang Xie,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AHELM是一个全面的音频-语言模型基准测试，集成了10个评估维度，包括感知、推理、公平性等，测试了14个模型并发现Gemini 2.5 Pro在多个方面领先但存在公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-语言模型评估缺乏标准化基准，测试维度有限且难以跨模型比较，需要开发一个全面的评估框架。

Method: 开发AHELM基准，整合多个数据集（包括新创建的PARADE和CoRe-Bench），标准化提示词、推理参数和评估指标，测试14个开放和闭源模型。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个维度中的5个排名第一，但在ASR任务中存在群体不公平问题；基线系统表现意外良好，其中一个仅具备语音转文本功能的系统总体排名第五。

Conclusion: AHELM提供了音频-语言模型的全面评估框架，揭示了当前模型的优势与不足，特别是公平性问题，并作为持续更新的基准测试平台。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

Motivation: 传统遗忘操作主要基于经典逻辑，如变量消除和AGM收缩，但缺乏对认知状态的深入分析。本文旨在从认知角度研究遗忘操作，探索在更丰富语义结构中的遗忘含义。

Method: 采用认知状态视角，提出五种通用认知遗忘类型，并在Spohn排序函数中实例化七种具体操作。借鉴逻辑编程和AGM理论的公理体系，构建评估框架对操作进行全面分析。

Result: 建立了认知遗忘的完整分类体系，七种具体操作在公理评估中表现出不同的特性和适用场景，揭示了遗忘操作之间的差异性和共同特征。

Conclusion: 研究为认知层面的遗忘操作提供了系统框架，展示了不同遗忘操作在认知状态中的表现，为知识管理中的选择性遗忘提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

### [10] [Learning Lifted Action Models From Traces of Incomplete Actions and States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21449)
*Niklas Jansen,Jonas Gösgens,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从状态-动作轨迹中学习STRIPS+模型的新方法SYNTH，用于处理滑动拼图等任务中状态信息不完整、动作参数隐含的复杂学习场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型学习方法大多假设动作是完整的STRIPS动作或所有域谓词都可观察，但实际应用中状态信息往往不完整，动作参数也隐含，需要更"现实"的学习设置。

Method: 引入STRIPS+变体，允许动作参数在前提条件中隐含，并提出SYNTH算法通过构建分层的前提表达式序列来唯一识别对象并接地隐含的动作参数。

Result: SYNTH算法被证明具有正确性和完备性，并在从现有STRIPS域派生的STRIPS+模型生成的状态-动作轨迹上验证了可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理状态信息不完整和动作参数隐含的现实学习场景，为从部分观察数据中学习动作模型提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus是一个包含311个任务的基准测试，专门针对多模态网络代理设计，要求深度视觉推理、来源验证和长时程工具使用，而非简单的图像搜索和文本匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态浏览基准测试往往可以通过浅层的固定工作流程解决，无法真正测试多模态理解能力。需要构建一个能够评估细粒度视觉推理、来源验证和长时程工具使用的挑战性基准。

Method: 采用空间-时间外推法构建任务，每个任务包含多个弱局部视觉信号，需要通过迭代的文本-图像搜索进行提取和传播，并在检索噪声下进行交叉验证。提供模型无关的代理框架和浏览工具。

Result: 最强代理（o3）在不搜索情况下达到15.1%准确率，在搜索框架下达到36.0%准确率；而最强的开源模型（Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct）在不搜索时为0.0%，经过20轮搜索后达到6.9%。

Conclusion: MMSearch-Plus成功构建了一个真正需要多模态理解的挑战性基准，揭示了当前模型在来源验证、基于部件的推理和长时程规划方面的失败，为多模态代理的发展提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于模糊Z数的智慧推理计算框架，将智慧量化为多维度和置信度双属性表示，通过道德困境任务验证了方法的有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智慧测量依赖自我报告，无法反映智慧固有的谦逊和不确定性特征。需要开发能够同时考虑多维性和置信度的计算框架来改进心理学测量并实现人性化AI

Method: 使用模糊推理系统和Z数（智慧分数+置信度分数），通过文化中立的图画道德困境任务收集语言响应，映射到5个智慧成分，基于21条规则和高斯核密度估计的隶属函数进行整合

Result: 概念验证研究表明，系统产生的双属性智慧表示与既定量表有适度但显著的相关性，与无关特质关系可忽略，支持收敛和区分效度

Conclusion: 该研究将智慧形式化为多维、不确定性感知的构念，通过模糊Z数为AI系统提供可解释、置信度敏感的安全推理，在严格计算和类人判断之间找到中间地带

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的反事实解释仅关注如何最小化修改现有计划来满足不同目标，但无法捕捉问题的高层特性。需要一种能够解释规划问题本身特性的方法。

Method: 提出了基于反事实场景的解释范式，给定规划问题P和LTLf公式ψ，识别对P的最小修改使得其能够生成满足ψ的计划。提出了两种基于显式量化满足ψ计划的定性实例化方法。

Result: 分析了生成反事实场景的计算复杂度，证明其通常与计算P的计划成本相当，展示了该方法的实际可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建实用算法提供了基础，反事实场景解释在自动化规划中具有实际应用价值，能够有效解释规划问题的特性。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

*Eduardo Illueca-Fernandez,Kaile Chen,Fernando Seoane,Farhad Abtahi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthProcessAI是一个基于GenAI的框架，通过集成多个大型语言模型(LLM)来自动解释过程挖掘结果并生成报告，简化了医疗保健领域过程挖掘的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程挖掘在医疗保健工作流分析中具有强大潜力，但面临技术复杂性、缺乏标准化方法和实践培训资源有限等障碍，需要更易用的解决方案。

Method: 开发了一个综合框架，包装现有的Python(PM4PY)和R(bupaR)库，集成多个LLM进行自动过程图解释和报告生成，使用脓毒症进展数据作为概念验证。

Result: 框架成功处理了四个概念验证场景的脓毒症数据，技术性能稳健。LLM评估显示Claude Sonnet-4和Gemini 2.5-Pro获得最高一致性分数(3.79/4.0和3.65/4.0)。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合结构化分析和AI驱动的解释，将复杂的过程挖掘结果转化为医疗保健应用中可操作的见解，代表了方法学上的新颖进展。

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

*Issa Hanou,Sebastijan Dumančić,Mathijs de Weerdt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过学习基于状态函数的广义野标点条件，构建可以跨问题实例通用的野标点图，提高规划器的解决效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野标点提取算法在某些规划问题中效果不佳，需要一种能够自动模拟域内通用的野标点发现方法

Method: 从解决的问题实例中学习基于状态函数的广义野标点，构建有向广义野标点图，包括循环可能性以处理重复子计划

Result: 从少量小型实例学习的广义野标点图在同域的更大实例中也有效，当识别出重复循环时性能显著提升

Conclusion: 广义野标点能够提取可解释的域信息，通过少量计划学习即可应用于自动规划器

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

Motivation: 多机器人导航和路径规划等高层次多代理规划问题可以通过确定性动作和观测有效模型化，但现有Dec-POMDP求解器无法高效处理大规模问题

Method: 提出Det-Dec-POMDPs模型类（确定性过渡和观测），并设计迭代确定性POMDP规划（IDPP）算法，基于联合均衡策略搜索框架

Result: IDPP算法特别优化了大规模Det-Dec-POMDPs的处理能力

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模多机器人规划问题提供了实用的解决方案，充分利用了确定性特性来提高计算效率

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

Motivation: 弥复杂运营研究输出与业务利益相关者理解之间的鸿沟，通过自然语言摘要、情境可视化和定制化KPI来提升决策支持效果。

Method: 采用混合整数规划构建多周期多品类的战术库存再分配优化模型，结合AI代理、RESTful API和动态用户界面的技术架构，支持实时交互和模拟分析。

Result: 案例研究表明该系统能够有效预防缺货、降低成本并维持服务水平，显著改善规划结果。

Conclusion: 该系统为供应链规划提供了创新的决策支持解决方案，未来可通过集成私有LLM、迁移学习、强化学习和贝叶斯神经网络来进一步增强可解释性、适应性和实时决策能力。

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

TL;DR: 将多启发式A*（MHA*）扩展为随时算法A-MHA*，能够快速找到可行解并持续改进，保持次优性和完备性保证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHA*虽然利用多个不可采纳启发式函数加速搜索，但只能一次性求解且需要精心设置膨胀因子，缺乏持续改进解的能力

Method: 受ARA*算法启发，将ARA*的概念精确适配到MHA*框架中，开发随时版本A-MHA*

Result: 在3D路径规划和滑块拼图领域验证性能，相比MHA*和其他随时算法表现良好

Conclusion: A-MHA*成功扩展了MHA*的随时求解能力，保持了原有的理论保证，在实际问题中表现出色

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

*Farhad Abtahi,Mehdi Astaraki,Fernando Seoane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEDLEY是一个医疗AI框架，通过保留多个AI模型的多样性输出而非追求共识，将模型偏见视为潜在优势，幻觉视为待验证假设，增强医疗推理的透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为AI偏见是需要消除的缺陷，但人类推理本身就包含教育、文化和经验形成的偏见，这些偏见可能不可避免且具有价值。

Method: 开发了MEDLEY概念框架，协调30多个大型语言模型，保留共识和少数观点，将模型特定偏见记录为优势，幻觉视为临床医生验证的临时假设。

Result: 概念验证演示器在合成病例中成功保留了共识和少数观点，使诊断不确定性和潜在偏见对临床监督透明可见。

Conclusion: MEDLEY通过重新定义AI不完美性为资源，提供了范式转变，为开发可信医疗AI系统开辟了新的监管、伦理和创新途径。

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多忽视科学文档的层次结构和文本视觉元素的语义整合，需要一种能够直接解决这两个挑战的自动化海报生成方法。

Method: 提出Poster Tree分层中间表示，采用多智能体协作策略，内容摘要和布局规划智能体通过迭代协调和相互反馈，联合优化逻辑一致性、内容保真度和视觉连贯性。

Result: 在多个学术领域的广泛实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估上均优于现有基线，生成的海报质量最接近专家设计标准，在信息保存、结构清晰度和用户偏好方面表现优异。

Conclusion: PosterForest框架成功解决了科学海报生成中的层次结构和语义整合问题，为自动化科学海报生成提供了有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

*Fabrizio Fagiolo,Nicolo' Vescera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种变分算法解决旅行商问题，采用紧凑排列编码减少量子比特需求，通过优化-冻结-重用策略在训练实例上优化电路结构后直接复用于新实例，仅需重新优化参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统变分算法中每次遇到新问题实例都需要重新进行结构搜索的高成本问题，提高NISQ设备上的实现效率。

Method: 使用紧凑排列编码减少量子比特需求；采用优化-冻结-重用策略：先在训练实例上用模拟退火优化电路结构，然后冻结该结构，在新实例上仅重新优化电路参数。

Result: 在4-7个城市的40个随机对称实例上，4城市达到100%最优路径采样概率，5城市90%，6城市80%，7城市降至约20%，显示方法的可扩展性限制。

Conclusion: 该方法对中等规模问题展现出强大的泛化能力，冻结Ansatz能显著减少求解时间而不降低解质量，但存在可扩展性限制，有望扩展到车辆路径和作业车间调度等更复杂问题。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分析中理解时间变量间的因果关系是一个核心挑战，特别是在完整因果结构未知的情况下。专家通常能够提供摘要因果图来捕捉主要因果关系，但如何利用这种高层抽象来指导微观层面的因果发现需要理论支持。

Method: 提出了在给定摘要因果图背景知识和假设存在忠实且因果充分的分布条件下，保证微观层面时间变量间边可定向性的理论条件。这些条件即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下也适用。

Result: 研究结果为微观层面的边定向提供了理论保证，即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下也能工作。这些发现为利用摘要因果图指导复杂时间系统中的因果发现提供了实用指导。

Conclusion: 该工作强调了将专家知识融入观测时间序列数据分析以改进因果推断的价值，为利用高层因果抽象指导微观因果发现提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP)，一种零样本测试时规划框架，通过树搜索和双层采样过程解决传统梯度引导在非凸、不可微和多奖励场景下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度引导方法在凸可微奖励场景表现良好，但在现实世界的非凸目标、不可微约束和多奖励结构中效果显著下降。现有监督规划方法需要任务特定训练或价值估计器，限制了测试时灵活性和零样本泛化能力。

Method: TDP将测试时规划构建为树搜索问题，采用双层采样过程：1) 通过无训练粒子引导生成多样化父轨迹以鼓励广泛探索；2) 通过任务目标引导的快速条件去噪精炼子轨迹。仅使用预训练模型和测试时奖励信号。

Result: 在三个不同任务上评估：迷宫金币收集、机械臂方块操作和AntMaze多目标探索。TDP在所有任务上始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TDP通过结构化轨迹生成平衡探索与利用，成功解决了梯度引导的局限性，无需任务特定训练即可实现零样本泛化，在复杂现实场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种协作式多智能体系统来模拟临床团队会诊，通过动态分配专家智能体进行分层迭代辩论，在识别充血性心力衰竭、急性肾损伤和败血症方面表现优于单智能体基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床叙述的准确解释对患者护理至关重要，但单模型方法缺乏高风险临床任务所需的鲁棒性

Method: 使用管理者智能体协调动态分配的专家智能体团队，进行分层迭代辩论以达成共识，仅分析SOAP笔记中的主观和客观部分

Result: 在420个MIMIC-III笔记数据集上评估，动态多智能体配置在识别三种疾病方面表现持续改善

Conclusion: 通过模拟临床团队的推理过程，该系统为更准确、鲁棒和可解释的临床决策支持工具提供了有前景的路径

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

TL;DR: 提出了CoBA框架，通过语义三元组分解和选择性修改来生成反偏见数据，有效减少深度学习模型对虚假相关性的依赖，提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易学习训练数据中的虚假相关性，导致性能下降和泛化能力差，需要一种通用方法来同时处理多种偏见并增强分布外鲁棒性。

Method: CoBA框架：1）将文本分解为主语-谓语-宾语三元组；2）选择性修改三元组以破坏虚假相关性；3）从调整后的三元组重构文本生成反偏见数据。

Result: 实验表明CoBA不仅提高了下游任务性能，还有效减少了偏见并增强了分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoBA提供了一个通用且鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效应对虚假相关性带来的挑战，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毒性言论数据集缺乏人口统计背景，限制了我们对不同年龄段用户在线交流方式的理解

Method: 与德国公共服务内容网络funk合作，收集Instagram、TikTok和YouTube的匿名评论，使用预定义毒性关键词筛选，结合人工标注和LLM标注（3,024条人工标注+30,024条LLM标注），识别侮辱、虚假信息、广播费批评等关键类别

Result: 16.7%的评论被标记为有问题，发现年龄相关的毒性言论模式差异：年轻用户偏好表达性语言，年长用户更常参与虚假信息和贬低行为

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究跨人口统计的语言变异提供了新机会，支持开发更公平和年龄感知的内容审核系统

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

TL;DR: TrInk是一个基于Transformer的笔迹生成模型，通过引入缩放位置嵌入和高斯记忆掩码来改善文本与笔画的对齐，在IAM-OnDB数据集上相比之前方法显著降低了字符错误率和词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的笔迹生成方法在捕捉全局依赖性和文本-笔画对齐方面存在不足，需要开发能够更好处理这些问题的模型。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的TrInk模型，在交叉注意力模块中引入缩放位置嵌入和高斯记忆掩码来改善对齐效果，并设计了主客观评估流程来全面评估生成笔迹的质量。

Result: 在IAM-OnDB数据集上，相比之前方法实现了35.56%的字符错误率降低和29.66%的词错误率降低，显著提升了生成笔迹的准确性和质量。

Conclusion: TrInk模型通过Transformer架构和创新的注意力机制改进，在笔迹生成任务上取得了显著性能提升，证明了其在捕捉全局依赖性和改善文本-笔画对齐方面的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose TrInk, a Transformer-based model for ink
generation, which effectively captures global dependencies. To better
facilitate the alignment between the input text and generated stroke points, we
introduce scaled positional embeddings and a Gaussian memory mask in the
cross-attention module. Additionally, we design both subjective and objective
evaluation pipelines to comprehensively assess the legibility and style
consistency of the generated handwriting. Experiments demonstrate that our
Transformer-based model achieves a 35.56\% reduction in character error rate
(CER) and an 29.66% reduction in word error rate (WER) on the IAM-OnDB dataset
compared to previous methods. We provide an demo page with handwriting samples

*Yoshiki Takenami,Yin Jou Huang,Yugo Murawaki,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大语言模型中的踏跃效应（anchoring effect），发现LLM与人类一样容易受该认知偏见影响，而推理模型能减轻这种效应，人格特质则与效应敏感性无显著关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知偏见在人类中已得到深入研究，但在LLM中的表现需要更多研究。本文通过价格协商场景来探索LLM是否也存在踏跃效应，以提高LLM在实际应用中的可靠性和责任性。

Method: 研究设计了卖方LLM代理应用踏跃效应的价格协商实验，使用主观和客观指标评估协商结果，并分析了推理能力和人格特质与踏跃效应敏感性的关系。

Result: 实验结果显示LLM像人类一样容易受踏跃效应影响，推理模型能够减轻这种效应（长链式思绪可缓解踏跃效应），但人格特质与效应敏感性没有显著关联。

Conclusion: 研究证实了LLM中存在人类偏见，推理能力可以减少认知偏见的影响。这些发现有助于更深入理解LLM的认知偏见，为实现安全负责的LLM应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

TL;DR: Percept-V数据集评估多模态大语言模型在基本视觉感知任务上的表现，发现模型性能随问题复杂度增加而显著下降，且不同认知技能的难度存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在复杂任务上表现优异，但缺乏对基本视觉感知能力的系统评估，需要测试模型在无污染生成图像上的简单感知能力。

Method: 创建包含7200张程序生成图像的Percept-V数据集，分为30个类别测试不同视觉感知技能，并在GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进模型上进行测试。

Result: 实验显示所有测试模型在问题复杂度增加时性能显著下降，不同类别表现出相似的趋势，某些认知技能比其他技能更难。

Conclusion: MLLMs在基本视觉感知任务上存在明显局限性，性能随复杂度增加而下降，需要进一步改进模型的底层视觉理解能力。

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Motivation: 科学大语言模型的发展受到科学数据复杂性的形式，需要从数据角度理解其特殊需求和挑战

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM评估存在严重标签偏见，Claude标签总是提高分数，Gemini标签总是降低分数，错误标签经常导致排名反转，评分差异可达50个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型越来越多地被用于评估输出，需要研究其判断是否受到模型标签的影响，以确保评估的公平性。

Method: 使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude三种模型，在四种标签条件下（无标签、真实标签、两种错误标签）进行自评和交叉评估，采用整体偏好投票和三个质量维度（连贯性、信息性、简洁性）的百分比评分。

Result: 发现明显的非对称偏见：Claude标签始终提升分数，Gemini标签始终降低分数；错误标签经常导致排名反转，偏好投票差异达50个百分点，质量评分差异达12个百分点；Gemini在真实标签下自评分崩溃，Claude的自偏好增强。

Conclusion: 感知到的模型身份会严重扭曲高级判断并微妙影响详细质量评分，强调需要盲评或多模型评估协议来确保LLM基准测试的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

TL;DR: BED-LLM方法通过贝叶斯实验设计框架，让大语言模型能够智能地选择最大化信息增益的问题，在多轮对话中显著提升信息收集能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大语言模型作为多轮对话代理的能力，使其能够智能地、自适应地从用户或外部来源收集信息

Method: 基于序列贝叶斯实验设计框架，迭代选择最大化期望信息增益的问题，使用基于LLM信念分布的概率模型，并设计了专门的EIG估计器和候选查询策略

Result: 在20个问题游戏和用户偏好推断测试中，相比直接提示和其他自适应策略，BED-LLM取得了显著的性能提升

Conclusion: BED-LLM为LLM提供了原则性的信息收集框架，使其能够作为有效的多轮对话代理与外部环境交互

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Motivation: 传统HFACS分析方法存在扩展性和一致性问题，需要一种自动化、可扩展的解决方案来改善航空安全分析。

Method: 使用强化学习策略GRPO对Llama-3.1 8B语言模型进行微调，结合专门设计的多组件奖励系统和合成数据生成技术来应对类别不平衡问题。

Result: 模型表现显著提升，准确匹配准确度从0.0400提升到0.1800（增长350%），部分匹配准确度达到0.8800，超越了GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5-fiash等先进模型。

Conclusion: 证明了专门领域优化的小型模型能够提供更高效、更好的安全分析解决方案，同时提出了一种新的模型评估方法。

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到多语言字母表字符扰动攻击，导致性能显著下降，主要源于子词分词器的词汇表外问题

Method: 用基于像素的表示替代基于文本的嵌入，将单词渲染为单个图像，增强对噪声输入的鲁棒性并扩展多语言文本兼容性

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试中验证了模型对拼写噪声的鲁棒性和在多语言环境中的有效性

Conclusion: 像素基础的生成语言模型能有效解决文本模型的词汇表外问题，提供更强的噪声鲁棒性和多语言兼容性

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督语音模型是否像人类一样表现出语言习得的关键期效应，即延迟第二语言接触导致习得困难，延迟第一语言接触偏移导致第一语言保持。

Method: 训练具有不同第二语言训练开始时间和第一语言训练结束时间的自监督语音模型，使用儿童导向语音数据，评估其音素辨别性能。

Result: 自监督语音模型没有表现出明显的语音习得关键期效应。延迟第二语言接触的模型在第二语言上表现更好，延迟第一语言接触偏移导致第一语言遗忘。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型在语音习得方面不表现出人类式的关键期效应，这与基于文本的语言模型的研究结果不同，表明语音和文本处理在语言习得机制上可能存在差异。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DMP的解码内存管道方法，通过选择性推理和退火解码来加速自一致性方法中的多响应生成，在保持性能的同时实现最高3倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在幻觉问题，现有的自一致性方法虽然有效但计算成本高昂，因为需要重复生成。研究发现自一致性方法中存在冗余，即不同生成结果之间存在共享前缀标记，而非精确答案标记对语义内容贡献很小。

Method: 提出了解码内存管道(DMP)方法，通过识别自一致性方法中的冗余（表现为跨生成的共享前缀标记），采用选择性推理和退火解码策略来加速生成过程。该方法与模型、数据集、解码策略和自一致性基线正交。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在不牺牲AUROC性能的情况下实现了最高3倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: DMP方法能够显著提高多响应生成的效率，并且有望扩展到对齐和推理任务中，为解决自一致性方法的高计算成本问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

TL;DR: 本文通过'正常性'概念重新审视图灵测试，认为图灵测试评估的是平均/正常人类智能而非卓越智能，需要机器像普通人一样犯错。ChatGPT等大语言模型追求卓越智能而非正常智能，因此难以通过真正的图灵测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新解读图灵测试，探讨其对人工智能和人类认知理解的真正意义，挑战当前以大语言模型为代表的人工智能发展方向。

Method: 从统计学角度分析'正常'概念的双重含义（规范性和数学性），重新诠释图灵测试中'平均人类审讯者'的概念，将其理解为多个法官判断的标准化聚合。

Result: 提出图灵测试是正常智能的测试，由正常法官（代表多个审讯者平均判断）评估。ChatGPT等模型追求卓越智能，属于'人工聪明'而非真正的人工智能。

Conclusion: 图灵测试能否促进人类认知理解的关键在于人类心智是否可简化为平均心智，这超出了图灵测试本身，质疑了其所依赖的正常主义范式的概念基础。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现自动文本摘要评估存在严重的可复现性问题，ROUGE到LLM评估方法在不同实验设置下表现差异显著，提出了统一评估框架并揭示了评估指标在准确性、计算成本和稳定性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对自动文本摘要评估中存在的可复现性挑战，研究旨在揭示不同评估指标在实际应用中的表现差异，特别是LLM评估方法的可靠性问题。

Method: 基于SummEval数据集构建统一的开源评估框架，对六种代表性评估指标（包括经典ROUGE和新兴LLM方法如G-Eval、SEval-Ex）进行系统性实验比较。

Result: 发现文献报告性能与实际实验结果存在显著差异，揭示结构性权衡：与人类判断最一致的指标往往计算密集且运行稳定性较差，LLM评估存在随机性、技术依赖和有限可复现性问题。

Conclusion: 呼吁建立更稳健的评估协议，包括详尽文档记录和方法标准化，以确保自动摘要评估的更高可靠性，特别强调需要解决LLM评估的随机性和可复现性挑战。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

TL;DR: LLMs作为自动审稿生成器在检测研究逻辑缺陷方面表现不佳，即使论文存在明显逻辑错误，其生成的审稿意见也无显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地被用作全自动审稿生成器，需要了解其在检测研究逻辑缺陷这一核心审稿能力上的具体表现和局限性，以确保科学诚信。

Method: 开发了一个全自动的反事实评估框架，在受控条件下测试各种ARG方法检测研究逻辑一致性的能力。

Result: 研究发现，与预期相反，研究逻辑中的缺陷对ARG生成的审稿输出没有显著影响，表明当前模型在这方面存在严重局限。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现提出了三个可操作的建议，并公开了反事实数据集和评估框架，以促进该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医学奖励模型评估的空白，为医学多模态大语言模型的可靠评估提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在临床对齐方面的不足，并展示了微调改进的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义维度分析方法依赖预定义维度，只能提供粗粒度表示，忽略了更精细的概念区分。需要开发能够揭示粗粒度语义维度下子维度结构的新方法。

Method: 引入DCSRM模型，将大语言模型的词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入，每个编码特定语义信息。使用体素编码模型将这些子维度映射到大脑激活模式。

Result: 识别出一组可解释的语义子维度，发现语义维度按照不同原则结构化，极性是驱动分解为子维度的关键因素。神经相关性支持了这些子维度的认知和神经科学合理性。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了更细粒度的可解释语义子维度，揭示了概念意义的组织结构，为理解语言和大脑中意义的组织方式提供了新见解。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型存在可量化的意识形态深度差异，一些模型具有更稳固、抽象的政治特征，而另一些模型则更容易被提示工程操控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型表现出明显的意识形态倾向，但这些立场的稳定性和深度尚未被充分理解，表面响应容易被提示工程操控，需要探究其内部是否具有连贯的意识形态基础。

Method: 采用双重方法：1) 通过指令提示和激活引导测量开源LLM的可操控性；2) 使用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)探测模型内部机制，分析意识形态特征的分布和抽象程度。

Result: 发现可操控性较低的模型具有更独特和抽象的意识形态特征，其中一个模型比同等规模模型多7.3倍的政治特征。对深度模型核心政治特征的靶向消融能导致相关主题推理的一致逻辑转变，而浅层模型则只会增加拒绝输出。

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是LLMs的可量化属性，可操控性为研究其潜在政治架构提供了有价值的窗口，表明不同模型在意识形态表征的稳固性和复杂性上存在显著差异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

TL;DR: 本论文提出两种AI驱动的奖励策略，通过RLAIF框架激发7B参数小语言模型的中文问候语创意写作能力，其中基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法在生成质量和训练效率方面表现更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型创意写作能力强但计算需求大，小语言模型是替代方案但现有方法如SFT缺乏新颖性，RLHF成本高昂，需要更有效的方法来激发小模型的创意写作能力

Method: 采用RLAIF框架，探索两种AI奖励策略：1）使用多智能体拒绝采样框架训练的奖励模型；2）基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法，通过对抗训练和反思机制优化奖励函数

Result: 两种方法都显著提升了创意输出效果，但基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法在生成质量上表现更优，训练效率更高，减少对人类标注数据的依赖

Conclusion: 基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法为创意小语言模型提供了更可扩展和有效的路径，自动化评估方法与人类判断高度一致

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次聚类的自动分类器选择方法，通过优先考虑多样性来改进集成学习在假新闻检测中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的集成学习方法在假新闻检测中性能严重依赖于分类器的多样性，但选择真正多样化的模型仍然是一个关键挑战，特别是当模型倾向于学习冗余模式时

Method: 首先计算分类器之间的成对多样性，应用层次聚类将其组织成不同粒度级别的组，然后通过HierarchySelect探索层次级别来选择每个级别的一个分类器池，每个池代表不同的内部多样性，最后选择最具多样性的池进行集成构建

Result: 在6个数据集中的2个上实现了最高准确率，优于Elbow启发式方法和最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过优先考虑多样性并扩展性能考虑，有效提升了集成学习在假新闻检测中的效果，为解决分类器冗余问题提供了新思路

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Abstract: We present MahaSTS, a human-annotated Sentence Textual Similarity (STS)
dataset for Marathi, along with MahaSBERT-STS-v2, a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT
model optimized for regression-based similarity scoring. The MahaSTS dataset
consists of 16,860 Marathi sentence pairs labeled with continuous similarity
scores in the range of 0-5. To ensure balanced supervision, the dataset is
uniformly distributed across six score-based buckets spanning the full 0-5
range, thus reducing label bias and enhancing model stability. We fine-tune the
MahaSBERT model on this dataset and benchmark its performance against other
alternatives like MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT. Our experiments
demonstrate that MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity
tasks in Marathi, highlighting the impact of human-curated annotations,
targeted fine-tuning, and structured supervision in low-resource settings. The

privacy and comply with regulations, while preserving data usability for
diverse and crucial downstream tasks. This survey provides a comprehensive
overview of current trends and recent advances in text anonymization

evaluation frameworks, comprehensive metrics, benchmarks, and practical
toolkits for real-world deployment of anonymization solutions. This review
consolidates current knowledge, identifies emerging trends and persistent

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均提升7.15%的准确率，同时保持原始数据集规模

Conclusion: 建立了通过数据和模型动态人机协同进化的可持续LLM训练新范式

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Method: 对32名参与者按四种Keirsey人格类型分组，在数据分析、创意写作、信息检索和写作辅助四个任务中评估GPT-4和Claude 3.5的交互

Result: 理性类型强烈偏好GPT-4（尤其是目标导向任务），理想主义者更喜欢Claude 3.5（创意和分析任务），其他人格类型偏好依任务而异，情感分析确认了这些模式

Conclusion: 人格基础的分析能够曝露传统评估方法忽略的LLM差异，虽然总体有用性评分相似，但不同人格类型的用户确实存在系统性偏好

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

Motivation: 开发一个具有卓越文本表示能力的通用上下文文本嵌入模型，通过高质量、多样化的训练数据提升检索模型性能。

Method: 使用统一的多任务框架，包括专门的数据转换和训练策略。通过LLM API构建数据合成管道（包括释义、增强和硬负例生成），采用两阶段训练策略（检索预训练和全任务微调）。

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are
released on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0 license. For reproducibility, we

Motivation: 误导性可视化图表是社交媒体和网络上错误信息的重要来源，违反图表设计原则会扭曲数据并导致读者得出错误结论。现有AI模型训练和评估缺乏大型、多样化的公开数据集。

Method: 创建了Misviz真实数据集和Misviz-synth合成数据集，使用最先进的多模态大语言模型、基于规则的系统以及微调分类器进行全面评估。

Result: 任务仍然极具挑战性，检测误导性可视化图表对现有模型来说难度很大。

Conclusion: 发布了Misviz、Misviz-synth数据集和相关代码，为检测误导性可视化图表提供了重要的基准资源。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在多任务学习中存在跷跷板现象，某些任务的提升会损害其他任务性能，需要解决参数更新冲突问题

Method: 1) 独立微调识别核心参数区域 2) 基于区域重叠的任务聚类 3) 核心参数直接移植+非核心参数SLERP融合 4) 轻量级流水线SFT训练并冻结核心区域

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中显著减轻任务干扰和遗忘，持续优于传统多任务和多阶段微调基线

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架通过参数隔离和智能融合有效解决了多任务微调的冲突问题，为LLM适配下游任务提供了新思路

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

*Diane Tchuindjo,Omar Khattab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了推理密集型回归(RiR)任务，针对需要从文本中推断细微数值属性的场景，并开发了MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，在基准测试中取得了65%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究越来越多地将大语言模型应用于推理密集型回归任务，这类任务需要从文本中进行深度分析来推断数值属性，但现有的冻结LLM提示和Transformer微调方法在此类任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出了MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化（通过分析批次数据动态优化提示）和神经集成学习（整合多个模型的预测），该方法简单轻量且不需要大量任务特定数据。

Result: 在三个现实问题构建的RiR基准测试中，MENTAT方法相比冻结LLM提示和Transformer微调基线取得了最高65%的性能改进。

Conclusion: MENTAT方法在推理密集型回归任务上表现显著优于现有基线方法，但该领域仍有很大的改进空间，需要未来的进一步研究发展。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PiCSAR是一种无需训练的方法，通过联合对数似然对推理链和最终答案进行评分，在数学推理任务中显著优于现有方法，使用更少样本获得更好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Best-of-n采样通过生成多个候选解并选择奖励最高的方案来提高大语言模型的准确性，但关键挑战在于如何在没有真实答案的情况下设计评分函数来识别正确的推理链。

Method: 提出概率置信选择与排序（PiCSAR）方法，使用推理过程和最终答案的联合对数似然来评分每个候选生成，该方法自然分解为推理置信度和答案置信度。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中取得显著提升（MATH500 +10.18，AIME2025 +9.81），在20次比较中的16次以至少2倍更少的样本优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 分析表明正确的推理链展现出显著更高的推理和答案置信度，证明了PiCSAR方法的有效性。

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更安全、更负责任的AI系统提供了实用工具，能够有效支持大规模训练数据集的质量监控和分析。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for
indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based
pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

Result: 混合CNN随机森林模型表现最佳（85.4%准确率），优于自定义CNN基线（74.3%），VGG16预训练模型达到82.3%准确率

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合是自动化牙科诊断支持的有效途径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本外观迁移中由于Query-Key对齐导致的注意力泄漏问题，该问题会影响语义映射的准确性

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：1) Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射；2) Key-Value重排增强特征对应；3) 使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化以保持语义一致性

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于现有最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，显著提升了零样本外观迁移的性能表现

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的加速缓存框架，通过分析缓存累积误差的两个主要组件（特征偏移误差和步长放大误差），采用离线残差分析、轨迹感知校正和残差线性化模型，实现2倍推理加速同时保持甚至提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销巨大，特征缓存虽然是有前景的加速策略，但简单的重用会导致明显的质量下降，需要解决缓存引入的累积误差问题。

Method: 提出ERTACache框架：1）离线残差分析识别可重用步骤；2）通过轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分间隔；3）使用闭式残差线性化模型近似缓存诱导误差；联合校正特征偏移误差和步长放大误差。

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中，ERTACache实现高达2倍推理加速，同时保持甚至改善视觉质量。在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上，2倍加速下VBench退化最小，有效保持基准保真度。

Conclusion: ERTACache通过系统分析缓存误差机制并提出联合校正方法，成功解决了扩散模型缓存加速中的质量退化问题，实现了效率与质量的平衡，为扩散模型的实际部署提供了有效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该文章提出了时间视觉筛选(TVS)方法，通过保留关键视频段落和重构查询，以解决视频大语言模型的细粒度时间语义理解问题，在训练和推理阶段都取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类自然地通过拖动进度条进行时间筛选，但当前的视频大语言模型因为帧采样稀疏和帧间理解监督不充分，无法抓取细粒度的时间语义。

Method: 提出时间视觉筛选(TVS)任务，包括：(1)保留关键视频段落，(2)同步重构查询到最直接形式保持答案一致性，(3)保持答案的不变性和一致性。TVS是一个模块化的前端适配器任务，可集成到视频指令微调和视频问答管道中。

Result: 建立了首个TVS基准，提出的ReSimplifyIt基线在视频剪辑任务上比之前方法提升了0.47的F-1分数，同时在查询重写任务上也取得了竞争力的表现。实验显示集成TVS能够在训练阶段获得7.33%的相对提升，在推理阶段获得34.6%的相对提升。

Conclusion: TVS通过时间信息筛选有效改善了视频-语言理解能力，优化了理解负担和认知负荷的分配，在训练时对齐查询与关键视觉信息，在推理时支持查询感知的段落聚焦和流程化的查询表示。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

Result: 观察到使用姿态标注进行手术工具定位能够获得高质量结果

Conclusion: 姿态标注是手术工具定位的充分标注方式，发布的标注软件和基准模型将促进该标注方式的采用

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型安全机制容易受到分布偏移的规避攻击，或者需要大量模型特定调整，存在局限性。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，以补丁方式向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，支持构建多种安全补丁并灵活合并为统一补丁。

Result: 在六个不同的T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，显著优于其他7种最先进的安全机制（约20%），同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: Safe-Control是一种有效的即插即用安全解决方案，能够显著减少T2I模型的不安全内容生成，同时保持模型性能，具有很好的适应性和兼容性。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域（边界模糊）以及无目标或多目标情况时表现不佳，需要开发一个能同时预测目标存在性和生成分割掩码的系统。

Method: 提出GENNAV系统，能够预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码。构建了GRiN-Drive基准数据集，包含无目标、单目标和多目标三种样本类型。

Result: GENNAV在标准评估指标上优于基线方法。在5个不同地理区域的4辆汽车上进行的真实世界实验中，展现了优异的零样本迁移性能和跨环境鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV系统在处理stuff-type目标区域识别任务中表现出色，特别是在处理复杂场景和无目标/多目标情况时具有显著优势，验证了其在真实世界环境中的实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

TL;DR: R-4B是一种自适应思考的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度自动决定是否启动思考过程，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时也会进行冗余的逐步思考过程，导致计算效率低下。需要一种能够自适应决定是否启动思考的模型来提高效率。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练，结合双模式策略优化(BPO)。首先在精心策划的数据集上训练模型，包含思考和非思考两种模式的样本；然后在改进的GRPO框架下进行第二阶段训练，强制策略模型为每个输入查询生成两种模式的响应。

Result: R-4B在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中达到最先进性能，在大多数任务中优于Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准测试上与更大的16B模型性能相当，但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思考机制成功解决了多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时的计算效率问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

Conclusion: Mamba-based融合架构能显著推动多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下表现突出。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg是一个新颖的框架，通过联合3D辐射高斯重建和3D/3D配准，实现了椎体级别的CT/X射线配准，在噪声X射线条件下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统"渲染比较"方法在CT/X射线配准中的空间信息丢失和域差距问题，以及现有双平面X射线3D重建方法对密集视图要求和噪声处理的局限性。

Method: 提出RadGS-Reg框架，包含双平面X射线椎体辐射高斯重建模块（采用基于学习的RadGS重建方法和反事实注意力学习机制），以及患者特定的预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验表明，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg通过联合重建和配准的方法，有效解决了CT/X射线配准中的关键挑战，为图像引导导航提供了高精度和实时性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型面临重大挑战，需要合成数据来推动相关研究发展。

Method: 创建包含620万个合成3D住宅建筑的多模态数据集，每个建筑通过三种模态表示：LoD 4语义3D线框图、对应平面图图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云，语义标注从平面图图像中提取。

Result: 成功构建了SYNBUILD-3D数据集，包含丰富的语义信息（房间、门窗等），支持多模态3D建筑生成算法的开发，数据集和代码样本已公开。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D为开发新颖的生成式AI算法提供了重要资源，能够自动化创建LoD 4级别的3D建筑模型，同时保持语义-几何一致性，推动3D建筑建模领域的发展。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

Method: 提出了一种新颖的统一方法，能够同时处理三种径向畸变配置：单图像畸变、两图像相同畸变和两图像独立畸变。基于此方法构建了新的最小求解器。

Result: 在包括鱼眼相机图像在内的标准基准测试中，所提出的求解器在所有三种情况下都比现有最先进求解器更快，同时保持了相似的精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为径向畸变单应性估计提供了一个统一的框架，开发出的求解器在速度和精度方面都表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过全局概念激活向量(GCAV)框架，解决了多层CAVs表示不一致问题，实现跨层概念对齐和稳定的模型解释


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 独立计算的各层CAVs存在表示不一致性问题，影响跨层比较的可靠性

Method: 采用对比学习对齐各层概念表示，通过注意力机制构建全局集成的GCAV

Result: 显著降低了TCAV分数方差，提升了概念定位准确性和对对抗性驱动的稳健性

Conclusion: GCAV提供了更全面、可解释性强的深度学习模型概念编码理解方法

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个新颖的视觉上下文提示框架，通过在已见类别上训练的模型，仅使用上下文示例作为提示即可直接泛化到未见的新类别，无需参数调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ReID方法需要针对特定领域训练模型，缺乏泛化能力且需要大量标注数据。自监督学习虽然减少标注需求，但难以捕捉ReID关键的身份敏感特征。

Method: 结合LLM和视觉基础模型：LLM通过任务特定提示从少样本正负对推断语义身份规则，然后指导VFM通过动态视觉提示提取ID判别特征。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上的表现明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP通过将LLM衍生的语义概念与VFM预训练先验对齐，实现了对新类别的泛化，消除了数据集特定重新训练的需求。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

TL;DR: 本研究使用SegResNet模型在PANTHER挑战赛的两个MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务上进行评估，结果显示T1加权MRI任务DSC为0.56，T2加权MRI任务性能下降至DSC 0.33，表明小数据集和不同MRI序列对胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断、治疗计划和结果评估至关重要，但由于解剖变异性和数据集有限，自动化分割仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 采用SegResNet模型作为Auto3DSeg架构的一部分，在91例T1加权动脉对比增强MRI和50例T2加权MR-Linac病例上进行5折交叉验证，使用STAPLE集成方法并关注解剖相关感兴趣区域。

Result: 任务1（T1加权MRI）获得DSC 0.56、5mm DSC 0.73、HD95 41.1mm；任务2（T2加权MRI）性能下降，DSC 0.33、5mm DSC 0.50、HD95 20.1mm。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示了基于MRI的小数据集胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战性，不同MRI序列会引入变异性。尽管性能一般，但展示了自动化分割的潜力，强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强方法，通过逆向推断底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题，显著提升分割模型的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的心脏MRI分割模型难以泛化到不同成像序列，因为图像对比度差异很大。虽然成像协议不同，但相同的自旋物理属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）支配着所有获取的图像。

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）从观测的MRI图像逆向推断底层自旋属性，通过解决非线性逆问题；2）使用扩散模型学习自旋属性的先验分布；3）基于估计的自旋属性合成任意新序列的图像。

Result: 该方法能够从MRI图像获得有意义的自旋属性估计，作为可解释的潜在变量，实现高度灵活的图像合成。实验显示Reverse Imaging能够在完全不同图像对比度和成像协议下实现高度准确的分割。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging通过物理驱动的数据增强方法，从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化能力，为医学图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法为了泛化性而设计为用户无关，但过度依赖2D约束会损害3D精度，无法同时考虑个性化身体形状和3D姿态合理性。

Method: 首先校准用户身体形状，然后基于该形状进行个性化姿态拟合，使用点扩散变换器实现形状条件3D姿态先验，通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代指导姿态拟合。

Result: 方法不仅提高了骨盆对齐姿态精度，还改善了绝对姿态精度，且仅需合成数据训练，可作为即插即用模块增强现有3D姿态估计器性能。

Conclusion: PHD通过解耦形状校准和姿态拟合过程，有效缓解了对2D约束的过度依赖，在数据效率和集成灵活性方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

Method: 采用分层时间剪枝(HTP)策略：1)时间相关性增强剪枝分析帧间运动相关性；2)稀疏聚焦时间MHSA减少注意力计算；3)掩码引导姿态标记剪枝器通过聚类保留信息量最大的姿态标记

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上，HTP将训练MACs减少38.5%，推理MACs减少56.8%，推理速度平均提升81.1%，同时达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 该框架通过有效的分层剪枝策略，在显著降低计算成本的同时保持了扩散模型的性能优势，为高效3D人体姿态估计提供了可行方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 三阶段框架：1）2D风格转换模块将二值指纹转为灰度图像；2）3D结构扩展网络将2D图像外推为3D解剖体积；3）基于3D GAN的OCT真实感细化器添加纹理和噪声

Result: 生成了42万个合成样本，预训练识别模型后在小型真实数据集上微调，将EER从15.62%显著降低到2.50%

Conclusion: Print2Volume有效解决了OCT指纹数据稀缺问题，生成的合成数据质量高，能显著提升生物识别性能

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Motivation: 手术视频记录易于获取，但自动内容索引仍靠成挑战，特别是在医学内镜视频中对手术器械进行分割和识别。

Method: 使用区域基于全卷积网络（region-based fully convolutional network）进行实例感知的器械分割和识别，包括二值分割（器械/背景）和多类器械识别。

Result: 在训练样本数量较少的情况下，能够很高准确地定位和分割器械区域；但识别具体器械类型仍靠成挑战，主要因为手术器械之间高度相似。

Conclusion: 该方法在手术器械分割方面表现良好，但在器械类型识别方面需要更多研究来应对器械高度相似性带来的挑战。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

pretraining on remote sensing imagery. We introduce SatDINO, a model tailored
for representation learning in satellite imagery. Through extensive experiments
on multiple datasets in multiple testing setups, we demonstrate that SatDINO
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on much more common masked
autoencoders (MAE) and achieves competitive results in multiple benchmarks.
  We also provide a rigorous ablation study evaluating SatDINO's individual
components. Finally, we propose a few novel enhancements, such as a new way to
incorporate ground sample distance (GSD) encoding and adaptive view sampling.
These enhancements can be used independently on our SatDINO model. Our code and

TL;DR: 提出一种为全屏截图像（WSI）生成2D索引地图的标准化框架，通过细细细细的组织地图描述WSI内容，解决大规模WSI集合中手动检查的效率问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前WSI缺乏标准化的元数据标准，大规模WSI集合的内容选择依靠手动检查，效率低下且不适合包含数百万对象的大规模集合

Method: 提出一种通用框架，为WSI生成2D索引地图并提供基于具体应用领域的拓扑机制。组织成三个层次：来源、组织类型和病理改变，每个层都将WSI的区域分配到特定类别

Result: 在临床病理学领域进行了实践验证，使用通用语法和语义实现不同目录之间的互操性，并通过WSI目录、机器学习和图基于WSI表示等具体例子展示了该标准的优势和适用性

Conclusion: 该标准化框架能够为WSI集合提供详细的组织地图，大大提高了大规模WSI集合的内容选择效率，为AI算法开发提供了可靠的元数据支持，对于推动医学图像分析领域的发展具有重要意义

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中经常出现训练时未见的新类别，传统增量学习方法需要完全标注的数据集，这在实践中不现实

Method: 使用置信度伪标签替代人工标注，将伪标签集成到各种CIL方法中，通过置信度选择机制

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上评估性能下降，相比有监督方法获得竞争性结果，在class-iNCD方法上领先5%以上

Conclusion: ICPL方法在无监督增量学习方面表现出色，适用于资源受限环境，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

TL;DR: MedShift是一个基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges的统一类条件生成模型，用于合成和真实X射线图像之间的跨域转换，解决了医学成像中的域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成医学数据虽然可扩展，但与真实临床设置存在显著域差距，限制了模型的泛化能力。需要解决合成和真实X射线图像在衰减行为、噪声特性和软组织表示方面的差异。

Method: 提出MedShift模型，基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges，学习共享的域无关潜在空间，支持训练期间见过的任何域对之间的无缝转换。无需域特定训练或配对数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，MedShift在较小模型尺寸下仍能提供强大性能，在推理时可灵活调整以优先考虑感知保真度或结构一致性。

Conclusion: MedShift为医学成像中的域适应提供了一个可扩展和可泛化的解决方案，在X-DigiSkull新数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 现有全球树木监测产品主要关注二元树冠覆盖或冠层高度，无法在个体层面识别树木，限制了大规模树木监测的能力。

Method: 使用深度学习方法和3米分辨率PlanetScope影像，通过高斯核模拟可扩展大小的树冠，从机载激光雷达数据自动提取数十亿个点进行训练，能够识别森林内外个体树木。

Conclusion: 该方法为全球高分辨率树木监测提供了可扩展框架，并能适应未来提供改进影像的卫星任务。

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射(3DGS)虽然能实现高保真实时渲染，但在动态场景中存在高斯数据量过大和训练时间过长的问题，限制了其在流式任务中的应用。

Method: 提出分层锚点结构组织高斯球，粗粒度高斯表示场景低分辨率结构，细粒度高斯负责细节渲染；采用混合变形和生成策略建模帧间运动；使用双向自适应掩码机制提升训练效率。

Result: 大量实验表明，M框架在显著减少训练时间的同时，实现了优于现有方法的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 该框架为动态3D高斯溅射提供了一种高效的流式训练解决方案，在保持渲染质量的同时大幅提升了训练效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在本地设备部署时计算资源占用过高的问题，为视频指令系统和探索机器人等应用提供轻量化解决方案。

Method: 首先构建了一个仅有125M参数的专业图片描述模型，然后提出Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架，通过DeepLens模块提取详细的视觉表征并改善视觉基准能力。

Result: 该轻量模型在单句和详细描述任务上都达到了与大型多模态通用模型相当的性能，而Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架有效减少了视觉盲点问题。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了小规模专业模型在本地设备上部署的可行性，并通过改进的视觉基准技术显著提升了图片描述质量。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide
future method development.

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法通常只关注单一技术或特定类型OOD数据集，忽略了组合多种现有解决方案的潜力

Method: 提出Multi-Method Ensemble (MME)评分方法，统一整合最先进的OOD检测器，结合特征截断和多种评分函数

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试中显著优于现有方法，在ImageNet-1K基准上平均FPR95达到27.57%，比最佳基线提升6%

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验证明，组合特征截断和多种评分函数可以有效提升OOD检测的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Conclusion: 局部增强方法通过减少背景干扰，能够更有效地提升对抗补丁攻击的效果和迁移能力

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ELV-Halluc基准，首次专门针对长视频幻觉问题，系统研究了语义聚合幻觉(SAH)，发现SAH随语义复杂度增加而增加，并通过位置编码和DPO策略显著减少了27.7%的SAH比例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉内容。之前的基准主要关注短视频，而长视频中由于多个事件的语义复杂性增加，语义聚合幻觉(SAH)变得尤为关键，需要单独深入研究。

Method: 引入ELV-Halluc基准专门研究长视频幻觉；通过实验确认SAH的存在及其与语义复杂度的关系；采用位置编码策略和DPO（直接偏好优化）策略来缓解SAH；构建包含8K对抗数据对的数据集。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，显示SAH随语义复杂度增加而增加；模型在快速变化的语义上更容易产生SAH；位置编码策略有助于缓解SAH；DPO策略增强了模型区分事件内和事件间语义的能力；在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上均取得改进，SAH比例大幅减少27.7%。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统性地研究了长视频中的语义聚合幻觉问题，提出了有效的缓解策略，为视频多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题提供了新的研究方向和解决方案。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了基础模型在显微图像分析中的性能，为材料科学和生物图像分析提供了高效精确的分割解决方案

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Motivation: 无人机场景中宽视野和复杂组合语义对视觉语言理解提出挑战，现有方法缺乏细粒度语义且依赖精确实体划分，在动态环境中效果有限。

Method: HCCM框架包含两个组件：1）区域-全局图像文本对比学习（RG-ITC），避免精确场景划分，通过局部视觉区域与全局文本对比捕获层次化语义；2）区域-全局图像文本匹配（RG-ITM），评估全局跨模态表示中的局部语义一致性。还引入动量对比和蒸馏机制提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在GeoText-1652数据集上达到28.8%（图像检索）和14.7%（文本检索）的Recall@1最佳性能。在未见过的ERA数据集上实现39.93%的平均召回率，优于微调基线。

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的视觉语言理解挑战，通过层次化跨粒度对比和匹配学习实现了优异的性能和强大的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

*Yujin Park,Haejun Chung,Ikbeom Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EZ-Sort通过CLIP零样本预排序和不确定性引导的MergeSort，将成对比较的标注成本降低90.5%，比现有方法减少19.8%的标注量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成对比较虽然比绝对评分更可靠，但需要O(n^2)次标注，计算成本过高。现有方法通过主动采样将成本降至O(n log n)，但仍需进一步优化

Method: 1) 使用CLIP模型进行分层零样本预排序 2) 用自动化比较替代简单的人工比较 3) 初始化桶感知Elo分数 4) 运行不确定性引导的人机协同MergeSort

Result: 在多个数据集上验证：人脸年龄估计(FGNET)、历史图像年代学(DHCI)、视网膜图像质量评估(EyePACS)。相比全量成对比较减少90.5%人工标注，比现有方法减少19.8%标注量，同时保持或提高了评分者间可靠性

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性感知采样，为成对排序提供了高效可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可穿戴设备的普及，从自我中心视角建模人机交互成为一个重要但尚未充分探索的问题。研究旨在探索仅通过头部和手腕跟踪能恢复多少交互信息。

Method: 采用扩散变换器架构和独特的三变量扩散过程，联合建模人体运动、物体轨迹和接触序列。在头部中心规范空间中操作，增强全局方向鲁棒性。提出基于传送带的推理方法，可处理任意长度序列。

Result: 通过广泛评估，ECHO在自我中心人机交互重建方面超越了现有方法，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: ECHO首次提出了从最小观测数据中统一恢复三种模态的框架，展示了仅通过头部和手腕跟踪就能有效恢复人机交互信息的能力，为可穿戴设备应用提供了重要技术基础。

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了从单词级到行级OCR的进阶方法，通过直接处理整行文本来避免单词分割错误，并利用更大的语言上下文提高识别准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统字符分割OCR和现代单词级OCR都存在分割错误问题，单词检测成为了新的性能瓶颈。需要进一步提升OCR系统的准确性和效率。

Method: 提出从单词级OCR向行级OCR迁移的方法，直接将整行文本输入模型，输出字符序列。这样可以避免单词分割错误，并利用更大的句子上下文。

Result: 实验结果显示端到端准确性提高5.4%，效率提高4倍。还创建了包含251个英语页面图像的行级注释数据集。

Conclusion: 行级OCR方法在准确性和效率方面都显著优于单词级方法，并且有潜力利用大语言模型的进步。这是一个有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

TL;DR: 本研究评估了BLIP-2、InstructBLIP和LLaVA-1.5三个现成视觉语言模型在城市场景空间推理任务上的表现，发现零样本性能尚可，但通过合成CoT监督数据集微调后性能显著提升，特别是在否定和反事实推理等挑战性问题类型上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在通用场景上预训练，但其在城市领域中的细粒度空间推理能力（如物体、布局和深度线索理解）尚未得到充分探索，需要系统评估这些模型在城市场景中的表现。

Method: 构建基于街景图像分割、深度和物体检测预测的合成VQA数据集，每个问题都配有LLM生成的链式思维答案用于逐步推理监督，然后对三个VLMs进行零样本评估和微调实验。

Result: VLMs在零样本设置下表现合理，但使用合成的CoT监督数据集微调后性能大幅提升，特别是在否定和反事实推理等挑战性问题类型上改进显著。

Conclusion: 城市空间推理是VLMs的新挑战领域，合成数据集构建为通用模型适应专业领域提供了一条实用路径，CoT监督微调能有效提升模型在城市场景中的推理能力。

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法大多只考虑单一时间背景或专注于分类回归任务，无法进行细粒度空间预测，且往往局限于单一时间点或特定疾病

Method: Temporal Flow Matching (TFM) - 统一的生成式轨迹方法，学习底层时间分布，可回退到最近图像预测器，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM始终超越自然成像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和鲁棒的基线

Conclusion: TFM解决了医学成像中时间动态建模的基本差距，为疾病进展建模、治疗规划和解剖发展跟踪等应用提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Leibovich评分在肾清细胞癌复发风险预测中存在个体化精度不足和缺少形态学信息的问题

Method: 使用预训练编码器和Cox生存模型，测试单模态、后期融合和中间融合等多种模式，整合本前CT和本后病理全手片图像

Result: WSI基础模型表现超过CT模型，中间融合方式最优，接近调整后Leibovich评分，形态学通过融合添加价值

Conclusion: 基础模型多模态整合在肾癌个体化风险预测中具有可行性，未来需探索更好的融合策略和更大数据集

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Motivation: 传统深度学习CGH方法存在三个主要问题：端到端网络忽略物理关系降低可解释性；CNN感受野有限难以捕捉长距离依赖；ASM方法局限于有限近场距离

Method: 深度展开网络将梯度下降分解为两个模块：自适应带宽保持模型（ABPM）扩展工作距离，相位域复数去噪器（PCD）使用复数可变形自注意力模块捕捉全局特征

Result: PSNR超过35dB，在模拟和真实数据上均达到最先进的结果，ABPM相比ASM方法具有更宽的工作距离

Conclusion: 所提出的DUN方法有效解决了CGH中的非线性不适定问题，在保持物理可解释性的同时显著提升了重建质量和灵活性

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Method: 扩展autoPET III nnU-Net框架，将用户提供的前景和背景点击编码为额外输入通道；系统研究空间提示表示方法；提出在线模拟用户交互和自定义点采样策略；使用欧几里得距离变换(EDT)编码。

Result: EDT编码方法持续优于高斯核；集成模型在交叉验证中表现最佳，相比基线模型减少了假阳性和假阴性；在有和没有外部数据训练的情况下都取得了良好结果。

Conclusion: 可提示模型在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中具有实现高效用户引导分割工作流程的潜力，代码已公开。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

Motivation: 现有HD地图构建方法使用基于注意力的标准映射技术存在泛化问题，容易产生虚假道路元素，需要更精确的图像到BEV空间映射方法。

Method: 提出新颖的概率投影机制，基于相机参数进行几何映射，通过置信度评分来优化映射对齐和过滤无关元素，并改进时序处理选择性地积累可靠信息。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集的新划分上实验表明，性能优于最先进方法，特别是在nuScenes和长感知距离挑战场景中改进显著。

Conclusion: 该方法通过概率投影和置信度机制有效提升了HD地图构建的精度和泛化能力，为自动驾驶场景提供了更可靠的地图生成解决方案。

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在数据增强时需要进行资源密集型全微调的问题，降低计算成本，使合成数据生成更加实用和可访问。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过低秩适应（LoRA）进行专门微调，构建轻量级合成数据生成管道。

Result: 在7个不同目标检测数据集上验证，仅用500张合成图像就比ODGEN基线使用5000张图像的效果更好，mAP@.50:.95提升高达21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA证明了质量和效率导向的方法比暴力生成更有效，仅用10%的数据和少量计算成本就能达到最先进性能，使合成数据创建更加实用和可访问。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有对抗性攻击检测方法需要昂贵的重新训练、修改网络架构或降低干净输入的性能，需要一种无需模型修改的实时检测方案。

Method: 通过在VGG-16上并行监控激活熵，分析早期卷积层中对抗性输入引起的熵变化模式。

Result: 对抗性输入使早期卷积层激活熵产生7%的偏移，实现了90%的检测准确率，误报率和漏报率均低于20%。

Conclusion: CNN的可靠性可以通过激活熵单独评估，为实现实时自诊断视觉系统提供了实用方案，且不影响原始模型性能。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Method: 开发CAD2DMD-SET合成数据生成工具，利用3D CAD模型、高级渲染技术和高保真图像合成技术生成多样化的VQA标签数据集，并构建DMDBench验证集评估模型性能。

Result: 使用CAD2DMD-SET生成的数据集对三个独立的独立模型进行微调后，ANLS指标显著提升，其中InternVL模型的得分增长了200%，且不影响其他任务的性能。

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET生成的训练数据集能够实质性提升LVLMs在具有挑战性条件下的稳健性和性能，该工具将作为开源项目释放，以支持社区生成更多的测量设备数据集。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,

*Zhixiong Zeng,Jing Huang,Liming Zheng,Wenkang Han,Yufeng Zhong,Lei Chen,Longrong Yang,Yingjie Chu,Yuzhi He,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UItron是一个开源的GUI代理基础模型，具有先进的GUI感知、定位和规划能力，通过系统数据工程和交互基础设施显著提升了移动/PC设备自动化操作性能，特别是在中文应用场景中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建GUI代理面临操作轨迹稀缺、交互基础设施不足以及基础模型初始能力有限等挑战，需要开发一个能够系统解决这些问题的开源基础模型。

Method: 采用监督微调处理各种GUI场景的感知和规划任务，然后开发课程强化学习框架支持在线环境的复杂推理和探索，建立了连接移动和PC设备的交互环境。

Result: UItron在GUI感知、定位和规划基准测试中表现优异，特别是在中文移动应用交互方面取得显著进展，收集了超过100万步操作轨迹数据。

Conclusion: UItron通过系统性的数据工程和交互基础设施构建，推动了GUI代理向实际应用迈进一步，为解决中文场景下的GUI自动化操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

*Ha Min Son,Zhe Zhao,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLIP-DCA方法来解决CLIP模型在域泛化评估中的性能下降问题，通过增强域感知表示和分离分类特征来提升在分布外数据上的表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有域泛化评估对基础模型如CLIP可能不够挑战性，因为其预训练数据可能已覆盖许多基准测试。需要更好的方法来评估CLIP在真实未见数据场景下的表现

Method: CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的域感知表示；2）通过合成生成多样化域数据；3）鼓励从域特征中解耦实现域不变分类

Result: CLIP-DCA相比现有方法在更具挑战性的评估中显示出显著改进，特别是在更分布外的数据集上表现更好

Conclusion: 增强域感知是基础模型中实现有效域不变分类的前提条件，CLIP-DCA通过解耦分类和域感知表示成功提升了域泛化性能

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了在视频学习中使用非典型异常数据对开放世界学习的益处，发现即使简单的学习方法也能在OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别等任务中提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在开放世界中展示出卓越的泛化和发现能力，而现有研究主要关注封闭集中的典型数据，视频领域的开放世界新颖发现研究不足。

Method: 收集包含各种非典型异常视频的新数据集，将其用于模型训练过程中的表示学习，重点关注OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别三个关键任务。

Result: 实验表明，使用非典型数据能持续提升各种设置下的性能；增加非典型样本的类别多样性可进一步提升OOD检测性能；在新类别发现任务中，使用较小但语义更多样的非典型样本集比使用较大但更典型的数据集效果更好；在零样本动作识别中，非典型视频的语义多样性有助于模型更好地泛化到未见过的动作类别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频对开放世界中的视觉表示学习具有显著益处，新提出的数据集鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

*Nattapong Kurpukdee,Adrian G. Bors*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无监督视频持续学习方法，通过核密度估计和新颖检测来处理无标签、无任务边界的视频数据序列学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据具有丰富的空间-时间信息，但在无监督持续学习领域很少被深入研究。现有研究主要集中在有监督学习，依赖标签和任务边界知识，而标签数据成本高且不实用。

Method: 提出使用无监督视频Transformer网络提取深度嵌入特征，通过核密度估计（KDE）构建非参数概率数据表示。引入新颖检测准则来动态扩展内存集群，捕捉新任务的新知识，并利用过往任务的过移学习作为当前任务的初始状态。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Something-to-Something V2三个标准视频动作识别数据集上进行深度评估，在不使用任何标签或类别边界的情况下，提出的方法在连续学习多个任务时显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为无监督视频持续学习领域提供了一个实用的解决方案，通过非参数方法有效处理了视频数据的复杂性和计算需求，为该领域的进一步研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

TL;DR: 基于nnU-Net框架，采用多阶段级联预训练策略，通过数据增强和模型集成方法，在有限的胰腺导管腺癌MRI数据上实现了最先进的分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌(PDAC)的MRI自动分割对临床工作流程至关重要，但面临肿瘤组织对比度差和标注数据稀缺的挑战

Method: 使用nnU-Net框架，采用深度多阶段级联预训练策略：从通用解剖基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上进行微调。通过五折交叉验证评估数据增强方案和训练计划，并构建定制化的异构专家模型集成

Result: Task 1获得0.661的Tumor Dice分数，Task 2获得0.523的分数，实现了5.46 mm的MASD和17.33 mm的HD95边界精度指标

Conclusion: 提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务中开发专业化高性能模型的鲁棒方法，通过度量感知集成策略有效解决了数据增强的权衡问题

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学评估中表现优异，在多项选择题测试中准确率达92.8%，显著优于GPT-4和GPT-3.5，但在真实临床场景中仍需专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估专门针对肿瘤学优化的新型大语言模型GPT-5在临床决策支持中的表现，特别是在放射肿瘤学领域的应用潜力。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：300道多项选择题的ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试和60个真实放射肿瘤学病例。四位认证放射肿瘤学家评估治疗建议的正确性、全面性和幻觉情况。

Result: GPT-5在多项选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于GPT-4(78.8%)和GPT-3.5(62.1%)。在病例评估中，正确性评分3.24/4，全面性评分3.59/4，幻觉罕见但存在实质性错误。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，但生成的临床建议仍需严格的专家监督，在复杂场景中仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法主要依赖精心设计的图像特征提取器和记忆库来捕捉对象间逻辑关系，但在正常数据有限的情况下存在挑战，需要增强逻辑异常检测能力

Method: 构建三个互补的记忆库：1）类级文本记忆库用于逻辑异常检测；2）对象级图像记忆库保持完整对象轮廓；3）补丁级记忆库用于结构性异常检测。通过多级检索和比较计算异常分数

Result: 在涉及工业和医疗领域的七个公开数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过协作记忆库统一结构性和逻辑性异常检测是有效的，TMUAD框架在多个领域表现出色

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

TL;DR: VoCap是一个灵活的视频模型，能够处理视频和多种模态提示（文本、框或掩码），生成时空掩码和对应的目标中心描述，同时解决可提示视频目标分割、参考表达式分割和目标描述任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中细粒度定位掩码和详细语义属性的理解是视频理解的基础任务，但获取此类数据既繁琐又昂贵。

Method: 通过预处理带有真实掩码的视频来突出感兴趣的目标，并将其输入大型视觉语言模型（VLM）来为现有大规模分割数据集（SAV）生成伪目标描述。在SAV-Caption数据集上大规模训练VoCap模型，并结合其他图像和视频数据集。

Result: 在参考表达式视频目标分割上达到最先进的结果，在半监督视频目标分割上具有竞争力，并为视频目标描述建立了基准。

Conclusion: VoCap模型在多个视频理解任务上表现出色，提出的SAV-Caption数据集将为相关研究提供重要资源。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，但视觉事件识别存在固有歧义性，同一图像可能被多个动词类别合理描述，需要重新审视这一设定。

Method: 将动词分类重新定义为单正例多标签学习(SPMLL)问题，提出Graph Enhanced Verb MLP模型，结合图神经网络捕捉标签相关性和对抗训练优化决策边界。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在保持传统top-1和top-5准确率竞争力的同时，实现了超过3%的平均精度均值(MAP)提升。

Conclusion: 动词分类本质上是多标签问题，提出的SPMLL框架和GE-VerbMLP模型有效解决了视觉事件识别中的语义模糊性，为场景识别任务提供了新的评估基准和方法论。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

TL;DR: DriveQA是一个全面的开源文本和视觉基准测试，用于评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的表现，发现现有模型在数值推理、复杂路权场景等方面存在显著弱点，但通过微调可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解。人类驾驶员需要识别现实数据集中罕见的边缘案例，因此需要构建一个全面的驾驶知识测试基准。

Method: 提出了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉版本(DriveQA-V)，涵盖交通法规和场景的各个方面。通过实验评估最先进的LLM和MLLM模型，并进行微调和预训练实验。

Result: 1) SOTA模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点；2) 在DriveQA上微调可提高多个类别的准确性，特别是在监管标志识别和交叉口决策方面；3) DriveQA-V的环境变化分析揭示了模型对光照、视角、距离和天气条件的敏感性；4) 在DriveQA上预训练可提升下游驾驶任务性能，在nuScenes和BDD等真实数据集上取得更好结果。

Conclusion: DriveQA基准测试揭示了当前LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识理解方面的局限性，但通过针对性的微调和预训练可以显著改善模型性能，证明模型能够内化文本和合成交通知识，并在下游QA任务中有效泛化。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据规模增长，数据分析工作流复杂性增加，非专家在关系数据库中执行因果推断工作流会导致重复性瓶颈，阻碍及时的业务洞察。

Method: ORCA是一个LLM代理系统，能够编排完整的数据分析流程：解释自然语言查询、导航数据库表、生成SQL代码、预处理数据、使用因果推断库配置建模过程。

Result: 在基准测试和合成电商数据集上的实证评估显示，ORCA在表理解、查询生成和因果效应估计方面具有竞争优势，在估计平均处理效应方面比GPT-4o mini提升超过7倍。

Conclusion: ORCA通过自动化常规工作流同时保持专家监督，能够实现稳健的数据驱动决策，降低对统计计算技术专业知识的要求。

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for decision-making science while the
complexity of the data analysis workflow, ranging from data wrangling to causal
analysis, increases substantially as the scale of data grows in complicated
business environments. Especially, the execution of the workflow in relational
databases by non-experts can result in repetitive bottlenecks which impede
timely and responsible business insights. To address this challenge, we propose
ORCA (Orchestrating Causal Agent), an LLM agentic system that can automate
routine workflows in RDBMS while preserving expert oversight via human-AI
interactions. ORCA orchestrates the full data analysis pipeline: interpreting
natural language queries, navigating tables from DB servers, generating proper
SQL codes, preprocessing data, and configuring modeling processes using causal
inference libraries. Domain experts still can control the automation through
iterative interactions with ORCA, enabling robust data-driven decision making
with less technical expertise in statistical computing. Empirical evaluations
on benchmark and synthetic e-commerce datasets demonstrate competitive
performance of ORCA in table understanding, query generation, and cause-effect
estimation -- achieving over $7\times$ improvement in estimating average
treatment compared to GPT-4o mini.

support approximate nearest neighbor search. We submitted implementations to
both Task 1 (approximate search on the PUBMED23 dataset) and Task 2 (k-nearest
neighbor graph construction on the GOOAQ dataset) under the official resource
constraints of 16 GB RAM and 8 CPU cores. The Hilbert forest demonstrated
competitive performance in Task 1 and achieved the fastest construction time in
Task 2 while satisfying the required recall levels. These results highlight the
practical effectiveness of Hilbert order-based indexing under strict memory
limitations.

TL;DR: Miffie是一个基于大语言模型的数据库自动化规范化框架，通过双模型自优化架构实现高精度的模式规范化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据库规范化对保持数据完整性至关重要，但传统手动方法耗时且容易出错，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 采用双模型自优化架构：生成模块消除异常，验证模块提供反馈，循环优化直到满足规范化要求；使用任务特定的零样本提示来提高准确性和成本效率

Result: 实验结果表明Miffie能够规范化复杂的数据库模式，同时保持高精度

Conclusion: Miffie框架成功实现了数据库规范化的自动化，无需人工干预，为大语言模型在数据库管理中的应用提供了有效方案

Abstract: Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it
is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by
data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization
framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie
enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high
accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that
combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and
verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on
the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the
requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot
prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost
efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex
database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

### [121] [Fast and Scalable Mixed Precision Euclidean Distance Calculations Using GPU Tensor Cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21230)
*Brian Curless,Michael Gowanlock*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出FaSTED算法，利用GPU张量核心的FP16-32混合精度计算欧氏距离，相比现有FP64方法获得2.5-51倍加速，精度损失小于0.06%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU张量核心具有高计算吞吐量，但之前只研究了FP64精度计算。利用FP16-32混合精度可以显著提升欧氏距离计算性能，但需要解决数据供给瓶颈问题

Method: 设计FaSTED算法，通过层次化数据重用和各级内存（全局内存、共享内存、寄存器）的高效利用，最大化张量核心的计算吞吐量

Result: 在4个128-960维真实数据集上，相比现有FP64张量核心算法获得2.5-51倍加速，相比FP32 CUDA核心算法也有显著提升，精度损失小于0.06%

Conclusion: FaSTED算法成功利用张量核心的FP16-32混合精度能力，为欧氏距离计算提供了快速可扩展的解决方案，在保持高精度的同时大幅提升性能

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with tensor cores (TCs) that are commonly used for
matrix multiplication in artificial intelligence workloads. However, because
they have high computational throughput, they can lead to significant
performance gains in other algorithms if they can be successfully exploited. We
examine using TCs to compute Euclidean distance calculations, which are used in
many data analytics applications. Prior work has only investigated using 64 bit
floating point (FP64) data for computation; however, TCs can operate on lower
precision floating point data (i.e., 16 bit matrix multiplication and 32 bit
accumulation), which we refer to as FP16-32. FP16-32 TC peak throughput is so
high that TCs are easily starved of data. We propose a Fast and Scalable Tensor
core Euclidean Distance (FaSTED) algorithm. To achieve high computational
throughput, we design FaSTED for significant hierarchical reuse of data and
maximize memory utilization at every level (global memory, shared memory, and
registers). We apply FaSTED to the application of similarity searches, which
typically employ an indexing data structure to eliminate superfluous Euclidean
distance calculations. We compare to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) TC Euclidean
distance algorithm in the literature that employs FP64, as well as to two
single precision (FP32) CUDA core algorithms that both employ an index. We find
that across four real-world high-dimensional datasets spanning 128-960
dimensions, the mixed-precision brute force approach achieves a speedup over
the SOTA algorithms of 2.5-51x. We also quantify the accuracy loss of our mixed
precision algorithm to be less than <0.06% when compared to the FP64 baseline.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出基于随机游走的去中心化联邦平均算法DFedRW，通过随机游走更新替代多步本地更新，解决异构数据下的收敛问题，并支持部分聚合和量化以提高通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在异构和不平衡数据下收敛缓慢或陷入次优解，且集中式架构存在单点故障和通信瓶颈问题。去中心化联邦学习虽能提高鲁棒性和隐私性，但现有方法忽略掉队者问题，减少训练数据并引入采样偏差。

Method: 提出DFedRW算法，使用随机游走更新替代多步本地更新；允许聚合部分随机游走更新，确保每次计算都贡献模型更新；提出量化版本进一步提高通信效率。

Result: 在凸条件下达到O(1/k^(1-q))的收敛上界；量化版本在通信和收敛间取得平衡；数值分析显示比传统FedAvg收敛速度和准确率更高，在高异构性下测试准确率提升38.3%和37.5%。

Conclusion: DFedRW算法有效解决了去中心化联邦学习在异构数据环境下的收敛问题，通过随机游走和部分聚合机制提高了训练效率和模型性能，量化版本进一步优化了通信效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a communication-efficient distributed machine
learning method that allows multiple devices to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data. FL can be categorized into centralized and
decentralized paradigms. The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to
aggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,
communication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the
decentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides
improved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in
leveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this
approach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal
models in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this
challenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),
which replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk
updates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized
versions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data
and introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial
random walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model
update. To further improve communication efficiency, we also propose a
quantized version of DFedRW. We demonstrate that (quantized) DFedRW achieves
convergence upper bound of order $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{k^{1-q}})$ under convex
conditions. Furthermore, we propose a sufficient condition that reveals when
quantization balances communication and convergence. Numerical analysis
indicates that our proposed algorithms outperform (decentralized) FedAvg in
both convergence rate and accuracy, achieving a 38.3\% and 37.5\% increase in
test accuracy under high levels of heterogeneities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPC社区虽然采用激励措施促进可复现研究，但由于基础设施独特性、软件依赖和严格访问限制，许多论文仍无法满足可复现要求

Method: 开发CORRECT GitHub Action工具，支持在远程HPC资源上安全执行测试，结合持续集成(CI)和完整溯源信息来替代资源访问限制

Result: 在三种不同类型的HPC应用上评估CORRECT的可用性，证明其能有效自动化和记录可复现性评估

Conclusion: 更好的HPC兼容CI解决方案将提高应用程序的可复现性，CORRECT工具为解决现有限制提供了可行方案

Abstract: The high-performance computing (HPC) community has adopted incentive
structures to motivate reproducible research, with major conferences awarding
badges to papers that meet reproducibility requirements. Yet, many papers do
not meet such requirements. The uniqueness of HPC infrastructure and software,
coupled with strict access requirements, may limit opportunities for
reproducibility. In the absence of resource access, we believe that regular
documented testing, through continuous integration (CI), coupled with complete
provenance information, can be used as a substitute. Here, we argue that better
HPC-compliant CI solutions will improve reproducibility of applications. We
present a survey of reproducibility initiatives and describe the barriers to
reproducibility in HPC. To address existing limitations, we present a GitHub
Action, CORRECT, that enables secure execution of tests on remote HPC
resources. We evaluate CORRECT's usability across three different types of HPC
applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of using CORRECT for automating
and documenting reproducibility evaluations.

Motivation: IoT应用在异构云边端环境中的快速发展带来了分布式调度优化的重大挑战，包括固定神经网络架构与计算异构性不兼容、跨域数据非IID分布以及跨域协作机制不足等问题。

Method: 提出KD-AFRL框架，包含三个核心创新：1）资源感知的混合架构生成机制；2）隐私保护的基于环境聚类的联邦学习方法；3）面向环境的跨架构知识蒸馏机制。

Result: 实验显示相比最佳基线，收敛速度提升21%，完成时间、能耗和加权成本分别提升15.7%、10.8%和13.9%。可扩展性实验表明在域数量增加时性能保持能力提升3-5倍。

Conclusion: KD-AFRL框架有效解决了多域IoT应用调度问题，在性能、效率和可扩展性方面均表现出显著优势，为异构云边端环境中的分布式调度提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications across
heterogeneous Cloud-Edge-IoT environments presents significant challenges in
distributed scheduling optimization. Existing approaches face issues, including
fixed neural network architectures that are incompatible with computational
heterogeneity, non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data
distributions across IoT scheduling domains, and insufficient cross-domain
collaboration mechanisms. This paper proposes KD-AFRL, a Knowledge
Distillation-empowered Adaptive Federated Reinforcement Learning framework that
addresses multi-domain IoT application scheduling through three core
innovations. First, we develop a resource-aware hybrid architecture generation
mechanism that creates dual-zone neural networks enabling heterogeneous devices
to participate in collaborative learning while maintaining optimal resource
utilization. Second, we propose a privacy-preserving environment-clustered
federated learning approach that utilizes differential privacy and K-means
clustering to address non-IID challenges and facilitate effective collaboration
among compatible domains. Third, we introduce an environment-oriented
cross-architecture knowledge distillation mechanism that enables efficient
knowledge transfer between heterogeneous models through temperature-regulated
soft targets. Comprehensive experiments with real Cloud-Edge-IoT infrastructure
demonstrate KD-AFRL's effectiveness using diverse IoT applications. Results
show significant improvements over the best baseline, with 21% faster
convergence and 15.7%, 10.8%, and 13.9% performance gains in completion time,
energy consumption, and weighted cost, respectively. Scalability experiments
reveal that KD-AFRL achieves 3-5 times better performance retention compared to
existing solutions as the number of domains increases.

Abstract: The evolution of blockchain technology, from its origins as a decentralized
ledger for cryptocurrencies to its broader applications in areas like
decentralized finance (DeFi), has significantly transformed financial
ecosystems while introducing new challenges such as Maximum Extractable Value
(MEV). This paper explores MEV on the Polygon blockchain, with a particular
focus on Atomic Arbitrage (AA) transactions. We establish criteria for
identifying AA transactions and analyze key factors such as searcher behavior,
bidding dynamics, and token usage. Utilizing a dataset spanning 22 months and
covering 23 million blocks, we examine MEV dynamics with a focus on Spam-based
and Auction-based backrunning strategies. Our findings reveal that while
Spam-based transactions are more prevalent, Auction-based transactions
demonstrate greater profitability. Through detailed examples and analysis, we
investigate the interactions between network architecture, transaction
sequencing, and MEV extraction, offering comprehensive insights into the
evolution and challenges of MEV in decentralized ecosystems. These results
emphasize the need for robust transaction ordering mechanisms and highlight the
implications of emerging MEV strategies for blockchain networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型训练经常因各种故障而中断，需要强大的容错能力。现有的无备份方法如冗余计算、动态并行和数据重路由都存在性能损失问题。

Method: Odyssey通过统一的性能模型、快速执行计划搜索、准确性能估计和高效通信优化，智能选择最优恢复策略。

Result: 在32卡集群实验中，Odyssey保持恢复后与无故障训练性能差距在11.00%以内，同时保持模型收敛和高效内存使用。相比最先进方法，吞吐量分别比Oobleck和Recycle提高1.229倍和1.355倍。

Conclusion: Odyssey系统能够有效处理训练中断问题，提供接近无故障训练的性能表现，是解决大规模语言模型训练容错问题的有效方案。

Abstract: Training large language models faces frequent interruptions due to various
faults, demanding robust fault-tolerance. Existing backup-free methods, such as
redundant computation, dynamic parallelism, and data rerouting, each incur
performance penalties, whether from ongoing overhead, lengthy reconfigurations,
or post-recovery inefficiencies. We propose Odyssey, an adaptive fault-tolerant
system that intelligently selects optimal recovery strategies when a failure
occurs. Odyssey achieves this through a unified performance model, expedient
execution plan search, accurate performance estimation, and efficient
communication optimizations. Experiments on a 32-card cluster show that Odyssey
maintains a performance gap of within 11.00% between post-recovery and
failure-free training, while preserving model convergence and efficient memory
usage. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, Odyssey achieves up to 1.229x and
1.355x higher average throughput than Oobleck and Recycle, respectively.

Motivation: 现有的MoE模型卸载技术由于I/O瓶颈和稀疏计算问题，硬件利用率较低，需要新的方法来充分利用硬件资源

Method: 提出SpecMoEOff方法，采用推测解码技术扩大专家工作负载，开发专用CPU分块注意力验证内核，并集成自动超参数调优器

Result: 实验结果显示，SpecMoEOff相比最先进的MoE卸载技术实现了最高2.5倍的解码吞吐量提升

Conclusion: SpecMoEOff通过推测解码和硬件资源协调，有效解决了MoE模型卸载中的硬件利用率问题，显著提升了推理性能

Abstract: Recent advancements in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have significantly
increased their parameter scale as well as model performance. Extensive
offloading techniques have been proposed to address the GPU memory limitations
of MoE inference. However, due to the I/O bottleneck and sparse computation of
MoE models, existing offloading techniques still suffer from low hardware
utilization. To fully utilize the hardware resources, we propose SpecMoEOff,
which employs the speculative decoding technique to enlarge the workload of
each expert. SpecMoEOff orchestrates the GPU and CPU by both theoretical and
empirical roofline analysis. In addition, we develop a dedicated CPU chunked
attention verification kernel to fit the speculative decoding in offloading
scenarios as well as minimizing the additional overhead led by draft models.
SpecMoEOff further integrates an optimizer to automatically tune the
hyperparameters of speculative decoding under given hardware and workload.
Experimental results show that SpecMoEOff achieves up to 2.5x decode throughput
improvement over the state-of-the-art MoE offloading techniques.

TL;DR: 数字双生体中推出了一种推-拉更新调度器(PPS)方案，通过动态分配通信资源来平衡正常状态下的双生体对齐和异常检测，优化了资源使用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字双生体的准确性依赖于与物理系统的及时同步，需要在拉取更新(减少偏差)和推送更新(异常报告)之间找到最优的资源分配方案。

Method: 设计了一种推-拉更新调度器(PPS)中经访问框架，动态分配用于两种类型更新的通信资源，在保持异常检测保证的同时优化资源使用。

Result: 与现有最优方案相比，该方案将错误信息的偏差年龄(AoII)减少了20%以上，并将最差情况下的异常检测AoII从70ms降低到20ms(在1ms平均偏差AoII约束下)。

Conclusion: PPS框架能够有效地平衡数字双生体的正常状态同步和异常检测需求，显著提升了系统性能和资源利用效率。

Abstract: A digital twin (DT) contains a set of virtual models of real systems and
processes that are synchronized to their physical counterparts. This enables
experimentation and examination of counterfactuals, simulating the consequences
of decisions in real time. However, the DT accuracy relies on timely updates
that maintain alignment with the real system. We can distinguish between: (i)
pull-updates, which follow a request from the DT to the sensors, to decrease
its drift from the physical state; (ii) push-updates, which are sent directly
by the sensors since they represent urgent information, such as anomalies. In
this work, we devise a push-pull scheduler (PPS) medium access framework, which
dynamically allocates the communication resources used for these two types of
updates. Our scheme strikes a balance in the trade-off between DT alignment in
normal conditions and anomaly reporting, optimizing resource usage and reducing
the drift age of incorrect information (AoII) by over 20% with respect to
state-of-the-art solutions, while maintaining the same anomaly detection
guarantees, as well as reducing the worst-case anomaly detection AoII from 70
ms to 20 ms when considering a 1 ms average drift AoII constraint.

Motivation: 现有仿真框架缺乏在QoS Flow Identifier级别对多流行为的高保真建模能力，无法满足智能工厂中设备处理多种并发流量流的QoS需求。

Method: 扩展Simu5G支持每QFI建模，并设计QoS感知的比例公平调度器(QoS-PF)，动态平衡延迟、保证比特率和优先级指标。

Result: 在包含边缘机器视觉、实时控制回路和大容量数据传输的智能工厂场景中，QoS-PF提高了截止时间遵守率和公平性，同时不牺牲吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该工作为工业5G部署中高级QoS策略的仿真和分析提供了方法和架构基础，所有扩展都以模块化和开源方式实现以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Private 5G networks are emerging as key enablers for smart factories, where a
single device often handles multiple concurrent traffic flows with distinct
Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Existing simulation frameworks, however,
lack the fidelity to model such multi-flow behavior at the QoS Flow Identifier
(QFI) level. This paper addresses this gap by extending Simu5G to support
per-QFI modeling and by introducing a novel QoS-aware Proportional Fairness
(QoS-PF) scheduler. The scheduler dynamically balances delay, Guaranteed Bit
Rate (GBR), and priority metrics to optimize resource allocation across
heterogeneous flows. We evaluate the proposed approach in a realistic smart
factory scenario featuring edge-hosted machine vision, real-time control loops,
and bulk data transfer. Results show that QoS-PF improves deadline adherence
and fairness without compromising throughput. All extensions are implemented in
a modular and open-source manner to support future research. Our work provides
both a methodological and architectural foundation for simulating and analyzing
advanced QoS policies in industrial 5G deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为每对语言单独开发翻译器，导致复杂度呈指数级增长。为了解决这个问题，需要一种统一的翻译框架来简化多语言之间的代码转换。

Method: 使用语言特定的词法分析器和解析器将源代码转换为AST，然后通过双向CrossGL翻译模块（包括ToCrossGLConverter导入类和CodeGen目标生成类）实现翻译，最后通过后端实现处理完整的翻译流水线。

Result: 通过跨编程领域的全面评估，证明了系统在所有支持的后端上都能成功编译和执行，验证了通用代码翻译的实践可行性。

Conclusion: CrossTL代表了向语言无关编程迈出的重要一步，实现了"一次编写，到处部署"的开发模式，统一的IR设计使得添加新语言只需最少的努力。

Abstract: We present CrossTL, a universal programming language translator enabling
bidirectional translation between multiple languages through a unified
intermediate representation called CrossGL. Traditional approaches require
separate translators for each language pair, leading to exponential complexity
growth. CrossTL uses a single universal IR to facilitate translations between
CUDA, HIP, Metal, DirectX HLSL, OpenGL GLSL, Vulkan SPIR-V, Rust, and Mojo,
with Slang support in development. Our system consists of: language-specific
lexers/parsers converting source code to ASTs, bidirectional CrossGL
translation modules implementing ToCrossGLConverter classes for importing code
and CodeGen classes for target generation, and comprehensive backend
implementations handling full translation pipelines. We demonstrate
effectiveness through comprehensive evaluation across programming domains,
achieving successful compilation and execution across all supported backends.
The universal IR design enables adding new languages with minimal effort,
requiring only language-specific frontend/backend components. Our contributions
include: (1) a unified IR capturing semantics of multiple programming
paradigms, (2) a modular architecture enabling extensibility, (3) a
comprehensive framework supporting GPU compute, graphics programming, and
systems languages, and (4) empirical validation demonstrating practical
viability of universal code translation. CrossTL represents a significant step
toward language-agnostic programming, enabling write-once, deploy-everywhere
development.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel research direction for model-to-text/code
transformations by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be enhanced
with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The focus is on quantum
and hybrid quantum-classical software systems, where model-driven approaches
can help reduce the costs and mitigate the risks associated with the
heterogeneous platform landscape and lack of developers' skills. We validate
one of the proposed ideas regarding generating code out of UML model instances
of software systems. This Python code uses a well-established library, called
Qiskit, to execute on gate-based or circuit-based quantum computers. The RAG
pipeline that we deploy incorporates sample Qiskit code from public GitHub
repositories. Experimental results show that well-engineered prompts can
improve CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and
consistent quantum code. However, the proposed research direction can go beyond
this through further investigation in the future by conducting experiments to
address our other research questions and ideas proposed here, such as deploying
software system model instances as the source of information in the RAG
pipelines, or deploying LLMs for code-to-code transformations, for instance,
for transpilation use cases.

Abstract: Unit testing is a core practice in programming, enabling systematic
evaluation of programs produced by human developers or large language models

been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to
produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL,
a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate
high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to
iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in
an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is
trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to
produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the
code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability
to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator.
In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B
trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the
same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth
unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those
induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL
outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit
tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 使用指令微调的大语言模型通过LoRA适配器和候选约束解码来实现故障分配，在EclipseJDT和Mozilla数据集上获得良好的短列表质量，显示了在实际应用中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型项目中的故障分配任务速度慢且不一致，需要一种轻量化的解决方案来替代成本高的特征工程和图基方法。

Method: 提出一种轻量框架，使用指令微调的大语言模型（LLM）结合LoRA适配器，并采用候选约束解码来确保分配结果的有效性。

Result: 在EclipseJDT和Mozilla数据集上进行测试，模型在短列表质量上表现强劲（Hit at 10指标达到0.753），虽然Top-1准确率不高。在最新数据集上准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: 指令微调的LLM提供了一种实用的替代方案，适合实际中的人在循环故障分配场景，有潜力在真实世界中应用。

Abstract: Bug triaging, the task of assigning new issues to developers, is often slow
and inconsistent in large projects. We present a lightweight framework that
instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) with LoRA adapters and uses
candidate-constrained decoding to ensure valid assignments. Tested on
EclipseJDT and Mozilla datasets, the model achieves strong shortlist quality
(Hit at 10 up to 0.753) despite modest exact Top-1 accuracy. On recent
snapshots, accuracy rises sharply, showing the framework's potential for
real-world, human-in-the-loop triaging. Our results suggest that
instruction-tuned LLMs offer a practical alternative to costly feature
engineering and graph-based methods.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在软件工程代理任务中，简单的观察屏蔽策略比复杂的LLM摘要方法更有效且成本更低，能够将成本减半同时保持或略微提高解决率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在处理复杂任务时会产生冗长昂贵的上下文历史，虽然现有SE代理使用LLM摘要来解决这个问题，但需要验证这种复杂方法是否真的比简单忽略旧观察更有效。

Method: 在SWE-agent框架和SWE-bench Verified数据集上，系统比较了原始代理、LLM摘要和简单观察屏蔽三种策略，使用了五种不同的模型配置进行测试。

Result: 观察屏蔽策略将成本减半，同时解决率与LLM摘要相当甚至略高（如Qwen3-Coder 480B从53.8%提升到54.8%），且成本更低。

Conclusion: 在SWE-agent环境中，最简单有效的上下文管理方法就是最简单的观察屏蔽策略，复杂摘要方法可能并不必要。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative
reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long,
expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE)
agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this
issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible
performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present
a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench
Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple
observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while
matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM
summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate
from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization
at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on
SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be
the simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility

TL;DR: LMPA是一个将大语言模型集成到指针分析中的新框架，通过LLM识别类似系统API的用户定义函数并相应建模，提高分析精度和可扩展性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指针分析框架由于对代码语义理解不足，导致对用户定义函数的处理过于保守，传播错误事实。LLM的发展为解决这一问题提供了新机会

Method: LMPA识别类似系统API的用户定义函数并相应建模，减少错误的跨调用上下文传播；通过推断初始点集和使用自然语言增强的摘要策略来改进基于摘要的分析

Result: 论文提出了LMPA的愿景框架，但未提供具体的实验结果（可能是愿景性论文）

Conclusion: LMPA展示了将LLM集成到指针分析中的潜力，能够提高精度和可扩展性，同时论文讨论了实现这一愿景的关键挑战

Abstract: Pointer analysis has been studied for over four decades. However, existing
frameworks continue to suffer from the propagation of incorrect facts. A major
limitation stems from their insufficient semantic understanding of code,
resulting in overly conservative treatment of user-defined functions. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities to bridge
this gap. In this paper, we propose LMPA (LLM-enhanced Pointer Analysis), a
vision that integrates LLMs into pointer analysis to enhance both precision and
scalability. LMPA identifies user-defined functions that resemble system APIs
and models them accordingly, thereby mitigating erroneous cross-calling-context
propagation. Furthermore, it enhances summary-based analysis by inferring
initial points-to sets and introducing a novel summary strategy augmented with
natural language. Finally, we discuss the key challenges involved in realizing
this vision.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了MPTCS方法，一种多策略测试用例选择框架，用于从任何策略测试方法生成的候选池中选择可重用、策略无关的测试用例，基于可解性、多样性和通用难度来揭示智能体行为的典型缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习策略测试方法通常针对特定策略生成测试套件，这些测试用例对其他策略的相关性不明确，难以实现测试用例的重用和跨策略验证。

Method: MPTCS使用一组策略基于难度评分从候选测试用例池中选择测试用例，采用受质量-多样性算法启发的离散化通用测试用例描述符表面来促进测试套件的多样性。

Result: 评估了难度评分的有效性，分析了方法效果和成本与策略集中策略数量的依赖关系，考察了多样性方法对状态空间的覆盖情况和触发故障行为的策略。

Conclusion: MPTCS能够选择出多样化的、策略无关的测试用例，有效揭示智能体行为的典型缺陷，为强化学习策略的可靠性验证提供了可重用的测试框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents show great promise in solving sequential
decision-making tasks. However, validating the reliability and performance of
the agent policies' behavior for deployment remains challenging. Most
reinforcement learning policy testing methods produce test suites tailored to
the agent policy being tested, and their relevance to other policies is
unclear. This work presents Multi-Policy Test Case Selection (MPTCS), a novel
automated test suite selection method for RL environments, designed to extract
test cases generated by any policy testing framework based on their
solvability, diversity, and general difficulty. MPTCS uses a set of policies to
select a diverse collection of reusable policy-agnostic test cases that reveal
typical flaws in the agents' behavior. The set of policies selects test cases
from a candidate pool, which can be generated by any policy testing method,
based on a difficulty score. We assess the effectiveness of the difficulty
score and how the method's effectiveness and cost depend on the number of
policies in the set. Additionally, a method for promoting diversity in the test
suite, a discretized general test case descriptor surface inspired by
quality-diversity algorithms, is examined to determine how it covers the state
space and which policies it triggers to produce faulty behaviors.

TL;DR: 大规模比较人类开发者与三大AI代码助手（ChatGPT、DeepSeek-Coder、Qwen-Coder）生成的代码质量，发现AI代码更简单但存在更多安全漏洞和未使用构造


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代码助手在软件开发中的广泛应用，需要了解AI生成代码与人类编写代码在可靠性、可维护性和安全性方面的差异

Method: 评估超过50万个Python和Java代码样本，使用正交缺陷分类法识别代码缺陷，采用通用弱点枚举分析安全漏洞

Result: AI生成的代码更简单重复但包含更多未使用构造和硬编码调试，人类代码结构更复杂但可维护性问题更集中，AI代码包含更多高风险安全漏洞

Conclusion: AI和人类编写的代码具有不同的缺陷特征，需要在AI辅助编程中采用专门的质量保证实践

Abstract: As AI code assistants become increasingly integrated into software
development workflows, understanding how their code compares to human-written
programs is critical for ensuring reliability, maintainability, and security.
In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human
developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and
Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security
vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code
samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via
Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common
Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and
more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging,
while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher
concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also
contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the
distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need
for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.

Method: 采用定性研究方法，对IT行业不同部门的敏捷和DevOps从业者进行11次半结构化访谈，通过主题分析提取51个独特代码并综合为19个主题。

Result: 研究详细分析了DevOps生命周期各阶段中敏捷方法的整合和实施情况，提出了敏捷方法与DevOps实践相互关系的新理解框架。

Conclusion: 研究成功达成了研究目标，为IT行业提供了关于敏捷方法如何有效整合到DevOps实践中的实践指导和理论框架。

Abstract: The demand for rapid software delivery in the Information Technology (IT)
industry has significantly intensified, emphasising the need for faster
software products and service releases with enhanced features to meet customer
expectations. Agile methodologies are replacing traditional approaches such as
Waterfall, where flexibility, iterative development and adaptation to change
are favoured over rigid planning and execution. DevOps, a subsequent evolution
from Agile, emphasises collaborative efforts in development and operations
teams, focusing on continuous integration and deployment to deliver resilient
and high-quality software products and services. This study aims to critically
assess both Agile and DevOps practices in the IT industry to identify the
feasibility and applicability of Agile methods in DevOps practices. Eleven
semi-structured interviews were conducted with Agile and DevOps practitioners
in varying capacities across several sectors within the IT industry. Through
thematic analysis, 51 unique codes were extracted and synthesised into 19
themes that reported on each phase of the DevOps lifecycle, specifically
regarding the integration and implementation of Agile methods into DevOps
practices. Based on the findings, a new understanding detailing the
interrelationship of Agile methods in DevOps practices was discussed that met
the research objectives.

### [140] [Treatment effects at the margin: Everyone is marginal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21583)
*Haotian Deng*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 该论文开发了一个框架，用于在政策同时改变参与激励和关注结果时识别处理效应，提出了边际加权估计量来解决内生选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准方法（如Heckman选择方程、局部平均处理效应、DID或RDD）无法在政策同时改变谁被观察的情况下分离处理效应，特别是在政策诱导进入的边际处。

Method: 引入了边际加权估计量，能够恢复政策诱导进入者的因果效应，为具有内生选择的情境提供政策相关的替代方法。

Result: 开发了一个能够广泛应用的框架，特别适用于依赖简化形式因果推断估计的领域，如劳动经济学、发展经济学和健康经济学。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决政策同时改变参与激励和结果变量的因果识别问题提供了有效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: This paper develops a framework for identifying treatment effects when a
policy simultaneously alters both the incentive to participate and the outcome
of interest -- such as hiring decisions and wages in response to employment
subsidies; or working decisions and wages in response to job trainings. This
framework was inspired by my PhD project on a Belgian reform that subsidised
first-time hiring, inducing entry by marginal firms yet meanwhile changing the
wages they pay. Standard methods addressing selection-into-treatment concepts
(like Heckman selection equations and local average treatment effects), or
before-after comparisons (including simple DiD or RDD), cannot isolate effects
at this shifting margin where treatment defines who is observed. I introduce
marginality-weighted estimands that recover causal effects among policy-induced
entrants, offering a policy-relevant alternative in settings with endogenous
selection. This method can thus be applied widely to understanding the economic
impacts of public programmes, especially in fields largely relying on
reduced-form causal inference estimation (e.g. labour economics, development
economics, health economics).

*Gordon Burtch,Robert Moakler,Brett R. Gordon,Poppy Zhang,Shawndra Hill*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文分析了数字平台广告实验工具（Lift测试和A/B测试）的差异，发现A/B测试存在受众分异问题，而Lift测试保持因果有效性，并提出了减少分异影响的配置建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字平台为广告主提供实验工具优化广告活动，但A/B测试中广告投放算法可能将不同广告变体投给不同受众群体，导致结果既反映广告内容效果又反映受众构成变化，影响因果解释。

Method: 研究大规模测量了3,204个Lift测试和181,890个A/B测试，分析受众平衡性，并探讨不同广告活动配置对减少分异交付的影响。

Result: Lift测试显示无显著受众不平衡，确认其因果有效性；A/B测试显示明显不平衡。某些广告配置选择可以减少A/B测试中的分异交付，降低算法对结果的影响。

Conclusion: 虽然无法完全消除A/B测试中的分异交付，但研究提供了基于证据的指导，帮助广告主在A/B测试中获得更可推广的广告内容洞察。Lift测试在因果推断方面更可靠。

Abstract: Many digital platforms offer advertisers experimentation tools like Meta's
Lift and A/B tests to optimize their ad campaigns. Lift tests compare outcomes
between users eligible to see ads versus users in a no-ad control group. In
contrast, A/B tests compare users exposed to alternative ad configurations,
absent any control group. The latter setup raises the prospect of divergent
delivery: ad delivery algorithms may target different ad variants to different
audience segments. This complicates causal interpretation because results may
reflect both ad content effectiveness and changes to audience composition. We
offer three key contributions. First, we make clear that divergent delivery is
specific to A/B tests and intentional, informing advertisers about ad
performance in practice. Second, we measure divergent delivery at scale,
considering 3,204 Lift tests and 181,890 A/B tests. Lift tests show no
meaningful audience imbalance, confirming their causal validity, while A/B
tests show clear imbalance, as expected. Third, we demonstrate that campaign
configuration choices can reduce divergent delivery in A/B tests, lessening
algorithmic influence on results. While no configuration guarantees eliminating
divergent delivery entirely, we offer evidence-based guidance for those seeking
more generalizable insights about ad content in A/B tests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然成本驱动的OFDI理论基础已确立，但关于因果机制的实证证据仍然有限，需要研究企业如何应对国内投入冲击进行生产重新配置

Method: 利用中国2017年废纸进口禁令作为外生冲击，采用双重差分策略，使用2000-2023年企业层面数据，分析造纸行业供应链特征

Result: 政策冲击使企业在政策后时期相对于对照组垂直OFDI概率增加约16%，证实企业通过跨境生产重新配置来应对国内投入冲击

Conclusion: 研究为理解企业在面对投入市场波动时的全球生产决策微观基础做出贡献，垂直OFDI是应对供给侧中断的战略性回应

Abstract: This paper examines how adverse supply-side shocks in domestic input markets
influence firms' vertical outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) decisions.
While the theoretical basis for cost-driven OFDI is well established, empirical
evidence on the causal mechanisms remains limited. We develop a framework in
which input cost shocks raise unit production costs, but firms undertake
vertical OFDI only when shocks are sufficiently severe or when baseline costs
are already high. Firm heterogeneity leads to a sorting pattern, whereby more
productive firms are more likely to invest abroad. To test this mechanism, we
exploit China's 2017 waste paper import ban as an exogenous shock and leverage
a distinctive feature of the paper product industry's supply chain. Using a
difference-in-differences strategy and firm-level data from 2000 to 2023, we
find that the policy shock increased the probability of vertical OFDI by
approximately 16% in the post-policy period relative to a control group. These
results provide robust evidence that firms respond to domestic input shocks by
reallocating production across borders, highlighting vertical OFDI as a
strategic response to supply-side disruptions. The findings contribute to
understanding the micro-foundations of global production decisions in the face
of input market volatility.

TL;DR: EconAgentic是一个基于大语言模型的框架，用于解决DePIN（去中心化物理基础设施）市场中AI代理自主操作带来的风险和效率问题，通过模拟AI代理对代币激励的响应来优化市场效率和社会目标对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DePIN市场通过代币经济和智能合约快速发展，但缺乏监管和AI代理的自主部署带来了效率低下和与人类价值观不对齐的风险，需要新的框架来应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出EconAgentic框架，重点研究三个领域：1）建模DePIN市场的动态演化 2）评估利益相关者行为及其经济影响 3）分析宏观经济指标以实现市场结果与社会目标的对齐。通过模拟AI代理对代币激励的响应、基础设施投资和市场适应，并与人类启发式基准进行比较。

Result: EconAgentic能够为DePIN市场的效率、包容性和稳定性提供有价值的见解，有助于学术理解和实际改进去中心化代币化经济的设计与治理。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了DePIN市场中AI代理自主操作带来的挑战，为去中心化经济的优化治理提供了有效的解决方案，具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Abstract: The Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) market is revolutionizing
the sharing economy through token-based economics and smart contracts that
govern decentralized operations. By 2024, DePIN projects have exceeded \$10
billion in market capitalization, underscoring their rapid growth. However, the
unregulated nature of these markets, coupled with the autonomous deployment of
AI agents in smart contracts, introduces risks such as inefficiencies and
potential misalignment with human values. To address these concerns, we
introduce EconAgentic, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered framework designed
to mitigate these challenges. Our research focuses on three key areas: 1)
modeling the dynamic evolution of DePIN markets, 2) evaluating stakeholders'
actions and their economic impacts, and 3) analyzing macroeconomic indicators
to align market outcomes with societal goals. Through EconAgentic, we simulate
how AI agents respond to token incentives, invest in infrastructure, and adapt
to market conditions, comparing AI-driven decisions with human heuristic
benchmarks. Our results show that EconAgentic provides valuable insights into
the efficiency, inclusion, and stability of DePIN markets, contributing to both
academic understanding and practical improvements in the design and governance
of decentralized, tokenized economies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多将福利非领取视为理性决策，但长期因素的影响证据有限，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用德国面板研究劳动力市场和社会保障(PASS)2008-2020年数据，结合行政数据重建家庭福利领取和收入历史，首次应用GETTSIM微观模拟模型模拟家庭资格。

Result: 长期因素显著影响UB II领取概率：较长福利领取历史增加概率，较高收入潜力和正收入冲击降低概率。忽略长期因素会导致现有模型设定错误。

Conclusion: 长期因素在福利领取决策中起重要作用，应纳入非领取行为分析框架，现有模型因忽略这些因素可能存在设定偏误。

Abstract: Extensive research demonstrates that many households eligible for
means-tested benefits do not claim them, a phenomenon known as non-take-up.
Empirical studies frequently conceptualise non-take-up as a rational decision,
occurring when the perceived net utility of claiming is negative.
Theoretically, long-term factors can substantially impact this decision.
Despite the potential relevance of longitudinal aspects, evidence on their
influence remains limited.
  This study addresses this gap by incorporating long-term factors in the
analysis of non-take-up behaviour relating to Unemployment Benefit II (UB II),
Germany's basic means-tested welfare programme. Using data from the German
Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS) from 2008 to 2020, linked
with administrative data from Germany's Federal Employment Agency (PASS-ADIAB),
this study reconstructs households' benefit receipt and income histories, even
during non-survey periods. This allows modelling benefit non-take-up for
eligible households using the duration and frequency of past benefit receipt.
In addition, the use of administrative data mitigates bias from self-reported
benefit receipt. Household eligibility for UB II is simulated using GETTSIM, an
open-source microsimulation model, applied to the PASS dataset for the first
time.
  Findings indicate that long-term factors significantly influence the
probability of claiming UB II. Specifically, a longer history of benefit
receipt increases this probability, whereas higher income potential and
positive income shocks reduce it. Including long-term factors substantially
affects the estimated impact of traditionally used determinants of non-take-up,
indicating a potential misspecification in existing models that neglect them.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了经济复杂性的组合模型，通过引入能力相关性的底层网络和细粒度的生产函数，将经济复杂性指数转化为对经济体能力的直接度量，提高了经济增长预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统经济复杂性指数（ECI）虽然能有效预测经济增长，但其基于同质能力组合的微观基础与不同产品类别需要不同能力、产品空间存在相互关联的事实不一致，需要建立更准确的理论模型。

Method: 通过两个创新扩展组合模型：1）建立能力相关性的底层网络；2）用细粒度的产品级产出函数替代原有的二元专业化函数。使用216个国家、5000种产品、20年的贸易数据进行验证。

Result: 模型能够准确复制产品空间的特征拓扑结构和国家出口篮子的复杂性分布，将经济复杂性度量转化为对经济体能力的直接度量，提高了ECI预测经济增长的信息量。

Conclusion: 该模型弥合了ECI与能力之间的差距，使经济复杂性能够作为生产能力替代性的代理指标，为理解经济发展提供了更准确的理论基础。

Abstract: Economic complexity - a group of dimensionality-reduction methods that apply
network science to trade data - represented a paradigm shift in development
economics towards materializing the once-intangible concept of capabilities as
inferrable and quantifiable. Measures such as the Economic Complexity Index
(ECI) and the Product Space have proven their worth as robust estimators of an
economy's subsequent growth; less obvious, however, is how they have come to be
so. Despite ECI drawing its micro-foundations from a combinatorial model of
capabilities, where a set of homogeneous capabilities combine to form products
and the economies which can produce them, such a model is consistent with
neither the fact that distinct product classes draw on distinct capabilities,
nor the interrelations between different products in the Product Space which so
much of economic complexity is based upon.
  In this paper, we extend the combinatorial model of economic complexity
through two innovations: an underlying network which governs the relatedness
between capabilities, and a production function which trades the original
binary specialization function for a fine-grained, product-level output
function. Using country-product trade data across 216 countries, 5000 products
and two decades, we show that this model is able to accurately replicate both
the characteristic topology of the Product Space and the complexity
distribution of countries' export baskets. In particular, the model bridges the
gap between the ECI and capabilities by transforming measures of economic
complexity into direct measures of the capabilities held by an economy - a
transformation shown to both improve the informativeness of the Economic
Complexity Index in predicting economic growth and enable an interpretation of
economic complexity as a proxy for productive structure in the form of
capability substitutability.

TL;DR: 本研究使用2018年中国家庭收入调查数据，通过三种统计方法分析辽宁和内蒙古城乡地区蒙古族、满族和汉族的收入差距，发现农村蒙古族存在显著工资惩罚，而城市收入差距主要可由公共部门就业和中共党员身份解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估中国不同民族群体（外来少数民族蒙古族、内部少数民族满族和主体民族汉族）在城乡地区的收入差距，探究民族政策在劳动力市场整合中的效果。

Method: 使用2018年中国家庭收入项目调查数据，采用三种统计方法：简单OLS线性回归、带交互项的线性回归、以及Blinder-Oaxaca分解法。

Result: 农村地区蒙古族遭受显著的民族工资惩罚，可能源于歧视；城市地区三个群体的收入差距主要可由公共部门职业参与和中共党员身份解释；农村蒙古族在公共部门工作和中共党员身份方面的回报率高于其他两个民族。

Conclusion: 中国的民族优惠政策在促进少数民族与汉族在劳动力市场结果方面的整合是有效的，这一发现与先前研究一致。

Abstract: This study analyzes the 2018 Chinese Household Income Project survey data to
evaluate the income gaps between an "outsider" ethnic minority group, the
Mongols, an "insider" ethnic minority group, the Manchus, and the majority Han
group in urban and rural areas of Liaoning province and Inner Mongolia in
China. Three statistical methods, a simple first-order OLS linear regression,
linear regressions with interaction terms, and the Blinder-Oaxaca
Decomposition, are used to investigate the income disparity amongst the three
groups. The results indicate that Mongols suffer a significant ethnic wage
penalty attributable to possible discrimination in the rural areas of these two
provinces, while the urban income gaps between the three groups can mostly be
explained by participation in public sector occupations or affiliation with the
Chinese Communist Party. In rural settings, Mongols also have higher returns to
public sector jobs and CCP membership compared to the other two ethnic groups.
The findings suggest that Chinese affirmative actions regarding ethnic policy
are effective in accelerating the integration of ethnic minorities with Han in
the outcomes of the labor market. This conclusion is consistent with previous
studies.

Motivation: 随着健康系统建模的发展，需要建立对医疗保健生产过程的稳健概念表征。Leontief技术（固定投入比例）在经济学中看似限制性强，但作者希望验证其在复杂健康系统模型中的适用性。

Method: 在马拉维Thanzi La Onse模型中采用基于Leontief技术的生产方法，并将其整合到全疾病、基于代理的建模框架中，分析该技术在实际应用中的表现。

Result: 研究发现，当Leontief技术被整合到全疾病、基于代理的模型中时，其原本的限制性特征（如规模收益不变、分段线性水平集）不再存在，反而成为描述医疗保健生产的丰富结构。

Conclusion: Leontief框架为描述医疗保健生产和检验健康系统投资回报提供了强大的建模工具，其在实际复杂模型中的应用价值超出了传统经济学理论的预期。

Abstract: As health system modeling (HSM) advances to include more complete
descriptions of the production of healthcare, it is important to establish a
robust conceptual characterisation of the production process. For the Thanzi La
Onse model in Malawi we have incorporated an approach to production that is
based on a form of Leontief technology -- fixed input proportions. At first
sight, this form of technology appears restrictive relative to the general
conception of a production function employed in economics. In particular, the
Leontief technology is associated with constant returns to scale, and level
sets that are piecewise linear, both of which are highly restrictive
properties. In this article we demonstrate that once incorporated into an all
disease, agent-based model these properties are no longer present and the
Leontief framework becomes a rich structure for describing healthcare
production, and hence for examining the returns to health systems investments.

TL;DR: 将非从众偏好嵌入社会学习模型，研究代理人在追求正确性和选择少数行动之间的权衡，分析其对信息获取、均衡策略和社会福利的影响

Motivation: 传统社会学习模型主要关注信息聚合，但现实中人们往往有非从众动机（如追求独特性、科学优先权等），需要研究这种动机如何影响信息获取和社会学习过程

Method: 在Bikhchandani-Hirshleifer-Welch模型基础上嵌入非从众偏好，使用高斯-二次规范，分析外生信号和内生产信息获取（固定进入成本和精度凸成本）

Result: 非从众动机使均衡临界点偏离1/2，扩大信息购买区域，维持信息性行动；适度非从众可抵消过早从众，但过度非从众会对抗信息性社会信号并导致低价值实验

Conclusion: 非从众偏好对社会学习具有双重影响：适度程度可改善信息聚合，但过度会损害信息效率，在科学优先竞争等应用中需要平衡独特性和信息价值

Abstract: We embed a taste for nonconformism into a canonical
Bikhchandani-Hirshleifer-Welch social-learning model. Agents value both
correctness and choosing the minority action (fixed or proportion-based bonus).
We study exogenous signals and endogenous acquisition with a fixed entry cost
and convex cost of precision in a Gaussian-quadratic specification. Contrarian
motives shift equilibrium cutoffs away from 1/2 and expand the belief region
where information is purchased, sustaining informative actions; conditional on
investing, chosen precision is lower near central beliefs. Welfare is shaped by
a trade-off: mild contrarianism counteracts premature herding, whereas strong
contrarianism steers actions against informative social signals and induces
low-value experimentation. A tractable characterization delivers closed-form
cutoffs, comparative statics, and transparent welfare comparisons. Applications
include scientific priority races and academic diffusion, where distinctiveness
yields rents yet excessive contrarianism erodes information aggregation.

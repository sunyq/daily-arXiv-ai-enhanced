However, most algorithms require a\nsynchronization mechanism, which is costly in terms of computational resources\nand time. If an algorithm can be executed in asynchrony, then it can use all\nthe available computation power, and the nodes can execute without being\nscheduled or locked. However, to show that an algorithm guarantees convergence\nin asynchrony, we need to generate the entire global state transition graph and\ncheck for the absence of cycles. This takes time exponential in the size of the\nglobal state space. In this dissertation, we present a theory that explains the\nnecessary and sufficient properties of a multiprocessor algorithm that\nguarantees convergence even without synchronization. We develop algorithms for\nvarious problems that do not require synchronization. Additionally, we show for\nseveral existing algorithms that they can be executed without any\nsynchronization mechanism. A significant theoretical benefit of our work is in\nproving that an algorithm can converge even in asynchrony. Our theory implies\nthat we can make such conclusions about an algorithm, by only showing that the\nlocal state transition graph of a computing node forms a partial order, rather\nthan generating the entire global state space and determining the absence of\ncycles in it. Thus, the complexity of rendering such proofs, formal or social,\nis phenomenally reduced. Experiments show a significant reduction in time taken\nto converge, when we compare the execution time of algorithms in the literature\nversus the algorithms that we design.

This paper introduces a\nCUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing\nefficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash\nequilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm\nfor solving large imperfect-information games.\n  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the\nlarge size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA\ntensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose\nthe game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2)\ninherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by\npairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This\ndesign reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and\nnode connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a\nround-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and\nrecursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach\nconstructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$\nnodes.

Leveraging lightweight techniques for content-based\nreplica placement and indexing of shards, AerialDB has been optimized for\nefficient processing of different possible combinations of typical spatial and\ntemporal queries performed by real-world disaster management applications.\nUsing containerized deployment spanning up to 400 drones and 80 edges, we\ndemonstrate that AerialDB is able to scale efficiently while providing near\nreal-time performance with different realistic workloads. Further, AerialDB\ncomprises a decentralized and locality-aware distributed execution engine which\nprovides graceful degradation of performance upon edge failures with relatively\nlow latency while processing large spatio-temporal data. AerialDB exhibits\ncomparable insertion performance and 100 times improvement in query performance\nagainst state-of-the-art baseline. Moreover, it exhibits a 10 times and 100\ntimes improvement with insertion and query workloads respectively over the\ncloud baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "AerialDB\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u533a\u57df\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u5378\u8f7d\u5230\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u4e91\u7aef\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "AerialDB\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5bb9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u526f\u672c\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u5206\u7247\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u7a7a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u5728400\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c80\u4e2a\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "AerialDB\u5728\u63d2\u5165\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347100\u500d\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e91\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534710\u500d\u548c100\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AerialDB\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

We first show that under no-anticipation and parallel-trends\nassumptions, we can identify event-study effects comparing outcomes under the\nactual treatment path and under the status-quo path where all units would have\nkept their period-one treatment throughout the panel. Those effects can be\nhelpful to evaluate ex-post the policies that effectively took place, and once\nproperly normalized they estimate weighted averages of marginal effects of the\ncurrent and lagged treatments on the outcome. Yet, they may still be hard to\ninterpret, and they cannot be used to evaluate the effects of other policies\nthan the ones that were conducted. To make progress, we impose another\nrestriction, namely a random coefficients distributed-lag linear model, where\neffects remain constant over time. Under this model, the usual distributed-lag\ntwo-way-fixed-effects regression may be misleading. Instead, we show that this\nrandom coefficients model can be estimated simply.

The primary\ncontributions of this paper are threefold: we analyze threat models unique to\nmusic information retrieval systems; we provide a theoretical analysis and\npropose an efficient AHE-based solution through inner products of music\nembeddings to deliver privacy-preserving similarity search; and finally, we\ndemonstrate the efficiency and practicality of the proposed approach through\nempirical evaluation and comparison to FHE schemes on real-world MP3 files.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u6cd5\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\uff08AHE\uff09\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u97f3\u4e50\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u52a0\u5bc6\u548c\u5168\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\uff08FHE\uff09\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u7248\u6743\u8bb8\u53ef\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u6c34\u5370\u5bf9\u62bd\u8c61\u6570\u5b66\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u97f3\u4e50\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAHE\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u97f3\u4e50\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5185\u79ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e0eFHE\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AHE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u97f3\u4e50\u5d4c\u5165\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing studies\ncaution that these tensions may not meaningfully reduce U.S. dependence on\nChina-linked supply chains. This study examines the drivers of this unmet\nreallocation under overlapping geopolitical and public health disruptions. It\ninvestigates how these shocks jointly reconfigured bilateral trade and global\nvalue chain (GVC) participation and positioning among the U.S., China, and\nmajor trading partners during 2016-2023. Using monthly bilateral trade data\nacross all sectors and multi-regional input-output tables for GVC\ndecomposition, we combine a multi-period event-study with structural analysis\nto evaluate trade-flow disruptions and shifts in participation and functional\npositioning within GVCs. We find that China's exports remained robust, expanded\nacross global markets, and sustained a rise in GVC participation, becoming more\nembedded in upstream segments through increased intermediate shipments to Asia\nand Europe. Meanwhile, U.S. imports increasingly shifted toward \"China+1\"\npartners, especially ASEAN, whose trade structures remain closely tied to\nChinese upstream supply chains. These strengthening triangular relationships\nreveal how global reallocation and GVCs have evolved around the U.S. and China\nacross successive shocks. Based on the evidence, we propose a supply chain\nresilience framework defined by three interacting dimensions: the level of GVC\nparticipation, the functional position within the value chain, and a country's\ncapacity to re-couple in the post-shock landscape, conditioned by market\ndiversification, economic complexity, and institutional capability.

Although there are increasing calls to include post-growth\nscenarios in high-level assessments, a coherent framework with what is required\nto model post-growth adequately remains absent. This article addresses this gap\nby: (1) identifying the minimum requirements for post-growth models, and (2)\nestablishing a set of model elements for representing specific policy themes.\nDrawing on a survey of modellers and on relevant post-growth literature, we\ndevelop a framework of minimum requirements for post-growth modelling that\nintegrates three spheres: biophysical, economic, and social, and links them to\npost-growth goals. Within the biophysical sphere, we argue that embeddedness\nrequires the inclusion of resource use and pollution, environmental limits, and\nfeedback mechanisms from the environment onto society. Within the economic\nsphere, models should disaggregate households, incorporate limits to\ntechnological change and decoupling, include different types of government\ninterventions, and calculate GDP or output endogenously.

As\nthe Internet grows, and more users connect, IPv6 is increasingly supported and\navailable to users and servers alike. But despite this steady growth, it\nremains unclear if the information control systems that implement censorship\n(firewalls, deep packet inspection, DNS injection, etc) are as effective with\nIPv6 traffic as they are with IPv4. In this paper, we perform the first global\nmeasurement of DNS censorship on the IPv6 Internet. Leveraging a recent\ntechnique that allows us to discover IPv6-capable open resolvers (along with\ntheir corresponding IPv4 address), we send over 20 million A and AAAA DNS\nrequests to DNS resolvers worldwide, and measure the rate at which they block,\nat the resolver, network, and country level as well examine the characteristics\nof blocked domains. We observe that while nearly all censors support blocking\nIPv6, their policies are inconsistent with and frequently less effective than\ntheir IPv4 censorship infrastructure. Our results suggest that supporting IPv6\ncensorship is not all-or-nothing: many censors support it, but poorly. As a\nresult, these censors may have to expend additional resources to bring IPv6\ncensorship up to parity with IPv4.

This result allowed\nMarkowitz to obtain his famous expression for portfolio variance. We show that\nMarkowitz's equation for portfolio random returns and the expression for\nportfolio variance, which results from it, describe a simplified approximation\nof the real markets when the volumes of all consecutive trades with the\nsecurities are assumed to be constant during the averaging interval. To show\nthis, we consider the investor who doesn't trade shares of securities of his\nportfolio. The investor only observes the trades made in the market with his\nsecurities and derives the time series that model the trades with his portfolio\nas with a single security. These time series describe the portfolio return and\nvariance in exactly the same way as the time series of trades with securities\ndescribe their returns and variances. The portfolio time series reveal the\ndependence of portfolio random returns on the random returns of securities and\non the ratio of the random volumes of trades with the securities to the random\nvolumes of trades with the portfolio.

Existing benchmarks fail to account for\nthis variability, leaving an important aspect of DBMS behavior underexplored.\n  In this paper, we address this gap by extending the Yahoo! Cloud Serving\nBenchmark (YCSB) to include an \"extend\" operation, which appends data to record\nfields, simulating the growth of values over time. Using this modified\nbenchmark, we have measured the performance of three popular DBMS backends:\nMongoDB, MariaDB with the InnoDB storage engine, and MariaDB with the MyRocks\nstorage engine. Our experiments alternate between extending values and\nexecuting query workloads, revealing significant performance differences driven\nby storage engine design and their handling of variable-sized values.\n  Our key contribution is the introduction of a novel benchmarking approach to\nevaluate the impact of growing value sizes and isolate the effect of querying\ndata with a distribution of data sizes from any cost associated with accessing\ndata after a history of updates.

We introduce\na lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared\nand task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between\ntasks.

This\navoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation\ntasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and\ntesting labels in lane line segmentation.

The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing\nEvaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative\ncategories according to category-level statistics, \\textit{e.g.}, category\nfrequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of\nLVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing\nobject hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that\noverlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative\nobject categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination\nsearching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate\nthe most misleading distractors (\\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or\nincorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which\nserves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To\nexplore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination\nsearching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to\napproximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with\nthe highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of\nhallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching\nconstructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false\ndescriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of\nat least 9\\% and up to 23\\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs,\nsignificantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities.

In practice, datasets often differ widely in structure,\nformat, schema, and semantics, creating substantial challenges for EM. We refer\nto this setting as Heterogeneous EM (HEM). This survey offers a unified\nperspective on HEM by introducing a taxonomy, grounded in prior work, that\ndistinguishes two primary categories -- representation and semantic\nheterogeneity -- and their subtypes. The taxonomy provides a systematic lens\nfor understanding how variations in data form and meaning shape the complexity\nof matching tasks.

Prior works have achieved notable progress on\nhuman-oriented erasing using explicit mask guidance and semantic-aware\ninpainting. However, they struggle under complex multi-IP scenarios involving\nhuman-human occlusions, human-object entanglements, and background\ninterferences. These challenges are mainly due to: 1) Dataset limitations, as\nexisting datasets rarely cover dense occlusions, camouflaged backgrounds, and\ndiverse interactions; 2) Lack of spatial decoupling, where foreground instances\ncannot be effectively disentangled, limiting clean background restoration. In\nthis work, we introduce a high-quality multi-IP human erasing dataset with\ndiverse pose variations and complex backgrounds.

Our multiphase approach combines expert\nannotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We\nlabeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic\nclassification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For\nsemantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%),\nfollowed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama\nslightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models\nshowing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to\nannotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection.

A key challenge in MARL is credit\nassignment, which involves assessing each agent's contribution to the shared\nreward.

In this work, we formalize the credit assignment level as the number\nof agents cooperating to obtain a reward, and address scenarios with multiple\ncoexisting levels. We introduce a multi-level advantage formulation that\nperforms explicit counterfactual reasoning to infer credits across distinct\nlevels.

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to\nstandard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional\nQ network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a\nlower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action\nselection and estimation bias of Q values. Simulation results show that the\nproposed algorithm can improve the privacy and the semantic information\ntransmission quality by up to 77.8% and 14.3% compared to the traditional\nreinforcement learning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u9690\u853d\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cb\u597d\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u69fd\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u9632\u6b62\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7a83\u53d6\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4f20\u8f93\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u6837\u8f85\u52a9\u53cc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6df1\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u529f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534777.8%\u548c14.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4f20\u8f93\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, label errors, defined as missing labels,\nincorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the\nquality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes\nof training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for\ndetecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically\nvalidated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to\ncorrect such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open\nproblem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction\ncalled REC$\\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the\nframework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced\nmicrotasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each\ncandidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate\nambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nREC$\\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our\ncrowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a\nrate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original\nannotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark\nfor label error detection and correction.

Despite the ever-improving capabilities\nof large language models (LLMs), effectively integrating persona fidelity in\nconversations remains challenging due to the limited diversity in existing\ndialogue data.

The key innovation is\nto train a dialogue model to correlate augmented responses with a quality score\nduring training and then leverage this knowledge at inference. We use\nnoun-based substitution for augmentation and semantic similarity-based scores\nas a proxy for response quality.

In the first stage, we train\nmodality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image using contrastive loss by\nconcatenating features from the three encoders. In the second stage, we train\ncross-encoders using contrastive learning to refine multimodal representations.\nAdditionally, we incorporate sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features to\nenhance implicit hate detection.

With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key\ninformation based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have\nsignificantly improved the performance of MER.

In this work, we extend\nsingle-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing\nthat when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct\npatterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by\naugmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10\nattributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary\ngender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns.\nFocusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias\nthrough the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called\nCoreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less\nconfident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five\nrecently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along\nvarious demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and\nsocio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about\ndoubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings.

This paper examines ASR bias through a\nphilosophical lens, arguing that systematic misrecognition of certain speech\nvarieties constitutes more than a technical limitation -- it represents a form\nof disrespect that compounds historical injustices against marginalized\nlinguistic communities. We distinguish between morally neutral classification\n(discriminate1) and harmful discrimination (discriminate2), demonstrating how\nASR systems can inadvertently transform the former into the latter when they\nconsistently misrecognize non-standard dialects. We identify three unique\nethical dimensions of speech technologies that differentiate ASR bias from\nother algorithmic fairness concerns: the temporal burden placed on speakers of\nnon-standard varieties (\"temporal taxation\"), the disruption of conversational\nflow when systems misrecognize speech, and the fundamental connection between\nspeech patterns and personal/cultural identity.

To\nbridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark\ndataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and\nshape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed\nthis dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques,\nincorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and\nhuman motions.

Retraining these massive\nmodels is computationally prohibitive, while existing knowledge editing\ntechniques can be slow and may introduce unforeseen side effects. To address\nthis, we propose DySK-Attn, a novel framework that enables LLMs to efficiently\nintegrate real-time knowledge from a dynamic external source. Our approach\nsynergizes an LLM with a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be updated\ninstantaneously. The core of our framework is a sparse knowledge attention\nmechanism, which allows the LLM to perform a coarse-to-fine grained search,\nefficiently identifying and focusing on a small, highly relevant subset of\nfacts from the vast KG.

Unlike natural scene segmentation, lesion delineation must reconcile\nsubtle texture and color variations, frequent artifacts (hairs, rulers,\nbubbles), and a strong need for precise boundary localization to support\ndownstream diagnosis. In this paper we introduce Our method, a novel ResNet\ninspired dual resolution architecture specifically designed for melanocytic\ntumor segmentation. Our method maintains a full resolution stream that\npreserves fine grained boundary information while a complementary pooled stream\naggregates multi scale contextual cues for robust lesion recognition. The\nstreams are tightly coupled by boundary aware residual connections that inject\nhigh frequency edge information into deep feature maps, and by a channel\nattention module that adapts color and texture sensitivity to dermoscopic\nappearance. To further address common imaging artifacts and the limited size of\nclinical datasets, we propose a lightweight artifact suppression block and a\nmulti task training objective that combines a Dice Tversky segmentation loss\nwith an explicit boundary loss and a contrastive regularizer for feature\nstability. The combined design yields pixel accurate masks without requiring\nheavy post processing or complex pre training protocols.

However, most existing\nagent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after\ndeployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving\nenvironments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution\ntechniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction\ndata and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation\nfor self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation\nmodels with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems.\nIn this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for\nself-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified\nconceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of\nself-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components:\nSystem Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a\nfoundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this\nframework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques\nthat target different components of the agent system.

While RL\ndrives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)\nshows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it\nmerely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a\nquestion: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior\nto develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a\nGRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a\nstudent model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from\nclassroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the\nstudent try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the\nmind in the right direction and then show the solution.

Their multimodal complexity poses new\nchallenges for video analysis, highlighting the need for video emotion analysis\n(VEA) within the community. Given the limited availability of SVs emotion data,\nwe introduce eMotions, a large-scale dataset consisting of 27,996 videos with\nfull-scale annotations. To ensure quality and reduce subjective bias, we\nemphasize better personnel allocation and propose a multi-stage annotation\nprocedure. Additionally, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented\nvariants through targeted sampling to meet diverse needs. While there have been\nsignificant studies on videos with clear emotional cues (e.g., facial\nexpressions), analyzing emotions in SVs remains a challenging task. The\nchallenge arises from the broader content diversity, which introduces more\ndistinct semantic gaps and complicates the representations learning of\nemotion-related features. Furthermore, the prevalence of audio-visual\nco-expressions in SVs leads to the local biases and collective information gaps\ncaused by the inconsistencies in emotional expressions. To tackle this, we\npropose AV-CANet, an end-to-end audio-visual fusion network that leverages\nvideo transformer to capture semantically relevant representations. We further\nintroduce the Local-Global Fusion Module designed to progressively capture the\ncorrelations of audio-visual features. Besides, EP-CE Loss is constructed to\nglobally steer optimizations with tripolar penalties.

Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine\nTranslation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without\nrelying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for\nLLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based\nQE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than\nregression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource\nlanguages given pre-training data distribution.

Our framework integrates low-rank\nadapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained\nTransformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the\nlayer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting,\nwhich adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head\nregression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE.

We curate and\nrelease a large-scale dataset of 150,430 High Court bail judgments, enriched\nwith structured annotations such as age, health, criminal history, crime\ncategory, custody duration, statutes, and judicial reasoning. We fine-tune a\nlarge language model using parameter-efficient techniques and evaluate its\nperformance across multiple configurations, with and without statutory context,\nand with RAG. Our results demonstrate that models fine-tuned with statutory\nknowledge significantly outperform baselines, achieving strong accuracy and\nexplanation quality, and generalize well to a test set independently annotated\nby legal experts.

To address this, we propose a novel method\nfor FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively\nenhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level\nsemantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed\nscales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale\nfusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor\n(SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures\nfrom shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns\nsemantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the\nhigh-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR\nare cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global\nsemantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new\nstate-of-the-art on four popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSCOPE\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9891\u7387\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9891\u7387\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "method": "SCOPE\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1aSubtle Detail Extractor\uff08SDE\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\u6d45\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\uff0cSalient Semantic Refiner\uff08SSR\uff09\u4ece\u9ad8\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SCOPE\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u9891\u7387\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Nonetheless, with the tool repository\nrapidly expanding, it is impractical to contain all tools within the limited\ninput length of LLMs. To alleviate these issues, researchers have explored\nincorporating a tool retrieval module to select the most relevant tools or\nrepresent tools as unique tokens within LLM parameters. However, most\nstate-of-the-art methods are under transductive settings, assuming all tools\nhave been observed during training. Such a setting deviates from reality as the\nreal-world tool repository is evolving and incorporates new tools frequently.\nWhen dealing with these unseen tools, which refer to tools not encountered\nduring the training phase, these methods are limited by two key issues,\nincluding the large distribution shift and the vulnerability of\nsimilarity-based retrieval. To this end, inspired by human cognitive processes\nof mastering unseen tools through discovering and applying the logical\ninformation from prior experience, we introduce a novel Logic-Guided Semantic\nBridging framework for inductive tool retrieval, namely, LoSemB, which aims to\nmine and transfer latent logical information for inductive tool retrieval\nwithout costly retraining. Specifically, LoSemB contains a logic-based\nembedding alignment module to mitigate distribution shifts and implements a\nrelational augmented retrieval mechanism to reduce the vulnerability of\nsimilarity-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoSemB\nachieves advanced performance in inductive settings while maintaining desirable\neffectiveness in the transductive setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLoSemB\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bed\u4e49\u6865\u63a5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u5de5\u5177\u68c0\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\u4e0d\u65ad\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5df2\u77e5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c1\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "LoSemB\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u903b\u8f91\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6316\u6398\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u6f5c\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLoSemB\u5728\u5f52\u7eb3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8f6c\u5bfc\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "LoSemB\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6865\u63a5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u672a\u89c1\u5de5\u5177\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, this study proposes an\nopen-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief\nTransformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory.

Finally, a full negation mechanism is\nemployed to transform the mass functions, so that existing combination rules\ncan be applied to the transformed mass functions for such information fusion.\nTheoretically, the proposed method satisfies three desirable properties, which\nare formally proven: mass function invariance, heritability, and essential\nconflict elimination.

A novel\nsegmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is\nproposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences.\nUnder the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving\nnotable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on\nCOCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes. After scaling up to a larger 2M-image\nsubset of SA-1B, S2-UniSeg further achieves performance gains on all four\nbenchmarks.

Notably,\nincreasing model size does not substantially mitigate this vulnerability.\nFurther analysis demonstrates that combining multiple persuasion techniques\namplifies the bias, and pairwise evaluation is likewise susceptible.

FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph\nConvolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and\ntopological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables\nthe model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging\ntopological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw\nimage intensities.

Recent advances in LLMs show promising potential in\nreducing the expert workload.

Conventional automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems are\ninsufficient to grasp expert preferences and domain-specific quality standards.\nTo address this gap and support human-AI collaborative writing, we focus on\nrelated work generation, one of the most challenging scientific tasks, as an\nexemplar. We propose GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates\nclassical related work evaluation criteria with expert-specific preferences.\nInstead of assigning a single score, our framework decomposes the evaluation\ninto fine-grained dimensions. This localized evaluation approach is further\naugmented with contrastive few-shot examples to provide detailed contextual\nguidance for the evaluation dimensions. The design principles allow our\nframework to deliver cardinal assessment of quality, which can facilitate\nbetter post-training compared to ordinal preference data. For better\naccessibility, we design two variants of GREP: a more precise variant with\nproprietary LLMs as evaluators, and a cheaper alternative with open-weight\nLLMs. Empirical investigation reveals that our framework is able to assess the\nquality of related work sections in a much more robust manner compared to\nstandard LLM judges, reflects natural scenarios of scientific writing, and\nbears a strong correlation with the human expert assessment.

However, their\ndependence on large neural architectures and the restricted accessibility of\npretraining data significantly limits their practicality in real-world\napplications. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment\nLearning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that\nefficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large\nHVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on\nthree typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape\npattern and multi-person interaction pattern.

With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL\neffectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns\nfrom large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks.\nExtensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the DPAL.

Recent diffusion-based models have\nshown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian\nbehavior for trajectory prediction.

To address the above\nchallenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction\nframework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions.\nShort-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which\ndecouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion\npatterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based\nendpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated\nprobabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling.\nFurthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive\nguidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising\naccuracy.

In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or\nlearnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training\nprocedures.

Current RVOS methods view referring\nexpressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic\nstructure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to\nimage-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and\nobject-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event\nattributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges\ntraditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose\nthe Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS\ninto object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization\nphase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which\nare then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to\nexchange the global cross-modal temporal context. For reasoning part, EventRR\nextracts semantic eventful structure of a video-referring expression into\nhighly expressive Referential Event Graph (REG), which is a single-rooted\ndirected acyclic graph. Guided by topological traversal of REG, we propose\nTemporal Concept-Role Reasoning (TCRR) to accumulate the referring score of\neach temporal query from REG leaf nodes to root node.

This severely hampers exploration and\nundermines effective policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose\nREX-RAG (Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration), a novel framework that explores alternative reasoning paths while\nmaintaining rigorous policy learning through principled distributional\ncorrections.

Furthermore, for EAGLE-based speculative\ndecoding, our optimizations enable us to achieve a speed-up for large batch\nsizes between 1.4x and 2.0x at production scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9Llama\u6a21\u578b\u7684EAGLE-based\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u751f\u4ea7\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u662f\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5de5\u7a0b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u8be6\u7ec6\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6811\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u7684GPU\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2aNVIDIA H100 GPU\u4e0a\uff0cLlama4 Maverick\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e3a\u6bcftoken\u7ea64\u6beb\u79d2\uff08\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a1\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb10%\u3002EAGLE-based\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.4x\u81f32.0x\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0cEAGLE-based\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e3aLlama\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6807\u6746\u3002"}}

To accurately generate descriptions related to\nthe image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and\nunderstand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically\ncapitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection\ninformation, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To\naddress these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image\nCaptioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text\nretrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap\nemploys an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and\nrelation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined\nprompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping\nnetwork is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to\nvisual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and\nvisual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature\nembeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap\nrequires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5%\nCIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the \"Karpathy\" test split.

Although existing deep\nlearning-based restoration methods have made considerable progress, they often\nstruggle to recover complex texture details, resulting in over-smoothed\noutputs.

Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing\nsemantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully\nleveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a\nsemantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features\nfrom low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space\nsemantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it\npreserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction.

Instead of\nrelying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings\ninitializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic\n3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the\nplanar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process,\nproviding strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural\naccuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits\nreconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian\nprimitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation.\nExperiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves\nreconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%.

However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their\nvulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly\ntransferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,\nwithout accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly\ndegrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a\nunified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is\nguided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant\nknowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each\ntransformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These\nforgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To\ndetect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that\nlearns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling\nreliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist\nadversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention\nlayers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by\nadversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the\nadversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean\nimages. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that\nForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack\nmethods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level\nforgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization.

To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that\nsystematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias\nstems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to\nprioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2)\nfeature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class\nconsistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model\nresponses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set\ninto subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to\nfilter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset.\nExperiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection\nand localization performance under different noise conditions.

To\nassess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses\nthe lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes\nreasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is\ngrounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity\nof each reasoning step.

To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using\nstructural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned\nperceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the\nUSAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the\ndevelopment of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and\nenhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the\nBlender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality\nnovel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My\ninvestigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original\nground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting.

The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian\nSplatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve\nphotogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions.

Each code in the codebook represents the structure of a\nspecific character, while the vector $w$ in StyleGAN controls the character's\nstyle, including typeface, orientation, and location. Through the collaborative\ninteraction between the codebook and style, we generate a high-resolution\nstructure prior that aligns with LR characters both spatially and structurally.\nExperiments demonstrate that this structure prior provides robust,\ncharacter-specific guidance, enabling the accurate restoration of clear strokes\nin degraded characters, even for real-world LR Chinese text with irregular\nlayouts.

This paper\nasks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of\nprocedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose\nSOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel\ndeep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates\nthe outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image\ndepicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and\nthe specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration,\ntemperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF\nrecurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that\nrefines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method\nleverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D\nrepresentations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA\naccurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme\nleads to a 22.18\\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk.

Although existing reinforcement learning\napproaches encourage models to generate reasoning chains before predictions,\nthey fail to explicitly constrain the reasoning process to ensure the quality\nof the final temporal predictions. To address this limitation, we propose\nTimestamp Anchor-constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding (TAR-TVG),\na novel framework that introduces timestamp anchors within the reasoning\nprocess to enforce explicit supervision to the thought content. These anchors\nserve as intermediate verification points. More importantly, we require each\nreasoning step to produce increasingly accurate temporal estimations, thereby\nensuring that the reasoning process contributes meaningfully to the final\nprediction. To address the challenge of low-probability anchor generation in\nmodels (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B), we develop an efficient self-distillation\ntraining strategy: (1) initial GRPO training to collect 30K high-quality\nreasoning traces containing multiple timestamp anchors, (2) supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) on distilled data, and (3) final GRPO optimization on the\nSFT-enhanced model. This three-stage training strategy enables robust anchor\ngeneration while maintaining reasoning quality.

Recently, the rapid growth of Multi-modal\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities to process\nmulti-modal inputs and generate complex vector controlling parameters,\nsuggesting the potential to address SVG U&G tasks within a unified model. To\nunlock MLLM's capabilities in the SVG area, we propose an SVG-centric dataset\ncalled UniSVG, comprising 525k data items, tailored for MLLM training and\nevaluation. To our best knowledge, it is the first comprehensive dataset\ndesigned for unified SVG generation (from textual prompts and images) and SVG\nunderstanding (color, category, usage, etc.). As expected, learning on the\nproposed dataset boosts open-source MLLMs' performance on various SVG U&G\ntasks, surpassing SOTA close-source MLLMs like GPT-4V.

The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity\ninformation inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion\ntransformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives.

This module divides latent tokens temporally into chunks, exploiting\ntheir long-range temporal dependencies to predict biases for rectifying tokens,\nthereby significantly enhancing inter-frame identity consistency.

Weakly supervised affordance\ngrounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person\ndemonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing\npixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using\na shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with\ndistillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since\naffordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models\nprimarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific\npatterns that are unrelated to affordance. To address this limitation, we move\nbeyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and\npixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at\nboth the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available\ninformation. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both\negocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by\nleveraging CLIP.

To compensate for the deficiency of\nrobot data, existing approaches have employed vision-language pretraining with\nlarge-scale data. However, they either utilize web data that differs from\nrobotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future\nframes at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under\ninsufficient robot data. In this paper, we propose to learn from large-scale\nhuman action video datasets in an explicit way (i.e., imitating human actions\nfrom hand keypoints), introducing Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical\nReasoning (AR-VRM). To acquire action knowledge explicitly from human action\nvideos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme,\nenabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human\nhand keypoints.

We argue that this challenge arises from the ''majority''\ncompletion rule in current VTON models, which leads to inaccurate skin\nrestoration in such cases. To address this, we propose UR-VTON (Undress-Redress\nVirtual Try-ON), a novel, training-free framework that can be seamlessly\nintegrated with any existing VTON method.

However, their sequential nature leads to long inference\ntimes, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped\nSpeculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR\nimage models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a\nmeans to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only\nmodest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis\nreveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image\ntokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can\nconvey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept\nonly a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference,\nleading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a\nnew SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than\nrelying on a single target token.

This framework is the first to\nleverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric\nawareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D\ngeneration and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Dream4D\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u548c\u795e\u7ecf4D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u76844D\u5185\u5bb9\u5408\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u4f73\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u59ff\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6301\u4e45\u76844D\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u65f6\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u57284D\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982mPSNR\u3001mSSIM\uff09\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Dream4D\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u548c\u795e\u7ecf4D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e864D\u5185\u5bb9\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Our approach is easily integrated as a module in\nexisting pipelines and generalizes well to trajectories with unknown physical\nparameters.

Attackers can bypass these\ndefenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models.\nThis means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their\nmodels, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense\nnot only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,\nwhich occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To\nachieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF).\nBenefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the\nframework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles.\nFirst, it can directly distort the forged results.

We conduct a comprehensive\nstudy on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the\ndense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for\nquality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while\ntraditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low\ncontrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and\ndrive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first\nlarge-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine\nbattery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world\nvisual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an\nintelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted\npre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate\nPBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed\nto extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point,\nline, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination\nbetween plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state\nspace modules.

However, existing\nvision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder\ntheir practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck,\nmanifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands,\nlimited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term\nsequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained\ncontrol over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present\nBeing-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our\napproach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human\nmotion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion\nsequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed\npart-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We\nintroduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion\ntokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts\nduring generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's\nsuperior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive\nefficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities.

Although this improves\nvisual perception, it introduces severe image token redundancy. Because image\ntokens carry sparse information, many add little to reasoning, yet greatly\nincrease inference cost. The emerging image token pruning methods tackle this\nissue by identifying the most important tokens and discarding the rest. These\nmethods can raise efficiency with only modest performance loss. However, most\nof them only consider single-image tasks and overlook multimodal in-context\nlearning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is more critical.\nRedundant tokens weaken the advantage of multimodal ICL for rapid domain\nadaptation and cause unstable performance. Applying existing pruning methods in\nthis setting leads to large accuracy drops, exposing a clear gap and the need\nfor new techniques. Thus, we propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning\n(CATP), a training-free pruning method targeted at multimodal ICL. CATP\nconsists of two stages that perform progressive pruning to fully account for\nthe complex cross-modal interactions in the input sequence. After removing\n77.8\\% of the image tokens, CATP produces an average performance gain of 0.6\\%\nover the vanilla model on four LVLMs and eight benchmarks, exceeding all\nbaselines remarkably.

Second, unlike most existing methods that process video\nmatting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal\ninformation, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong\ntemporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across\nthree benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance,\nand present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes,\nillustrating the strong generalization capability of our method.

Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained\nattention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize\ntarget moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer\nfrom semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the\nsame semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are\nfragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that\naligns with the text query. Also, they rely on skewed similarity distributions\nfor localization, making it difficult to select the optimal segment.\nFurthermore, they heavily depend on the use of LLMs which require expensive\ninferences.

Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large\nface datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.\nHowever, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in\nmultiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates\ndatabase management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face\nfor dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising\nsignificant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a\nnovel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.\nFirst, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to\nsecurely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it\nproposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training\ndata storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial\nrecognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve\nthe privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while\nensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also\nenables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their\npersonal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that\nVOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and\nprivacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance.

In\nsurgical operating rooms (OR), these manifest through the standardization of\nsmocks and gowns that obscure robust identifying landmarks, introducing model\nbias for tasks related to modeling OR personnel. Through gradient-based\nsaliency analysis on two public OR datasets, we reveal that CNN models succumb\nto such shortcuts, fixating on incidental visual cues such as footwear beneath\nsurgical gowns, distinctive eyewear, or other role-specific identifiers.\nAvoiding such biases is essential for the next generation of intelligent\nassistance systems in the OR, which should accurately recognize personalized\nworkflow traits, such as surgical skill level or coordination with other staff\nmembers. We address this problem by encoding personnel as 3D point cloud\nsequences, disentangling identity-relevant shape and motion patterns from\nappearance-based confounders. Our experiments demonstrate that while RGB and\ngeometric methods achieve comparable performance on datasets with apparent\nsimulation artifacts, RGB models suffer a 12% accuracy drop in realistic\nclinical settings with decreased visual diversity due to standardizations.

Our approach first warps the generated\nmonocular video into pre-defined camera viewpoints using estimated depth\ninformation, then applies a novel \\textit{frame matrix} inpainting framework.\nThis framework utilizes the original video generation model to synthesize\nmissing content across different viewpoints and timestamps, ensuring spatial\nand temporal consistency without requiring additional model fine-tuning.\nMoreover, we develop a \\dualupdate~scheme that further improves the quality of\nvideo inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from\ndisoccluded areas in the latent space.

Then a contrastive enhancement-based causal\nintervention is proposed to gradually mitigate the spurious attention and\nreduce noise information by aligning multi-head attention with the Gaussian\nmixture multi-label spatial. Quantitative and ablation results on Endo and\nMuReD show that IBCA outperforms all methods.

This narrows the\nsim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover\nmore corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA),\nwhich adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego\nvehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in).\nFinally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue\nof training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple\nstraight-line movements.

Although previous approaches\nhave attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical\nconstraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and\nphysical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of\nhuman perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven\nmetric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This\nmethod evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications\nneeded for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are\nable to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that\nserve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion,\na novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of\nhuman motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ\nPearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by\nincorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture\nfidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical\nalignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not\nonly aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of\nmotion fidelity than previous work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cPP-Motion\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u7eed\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faPP-Motion\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76ae\u5c14\u900a\u76f8\u5173\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "PP-Motion\u5728\u7269\u7406\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PP-Motion\u4e3a\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u5ba2\u89c2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness\nis often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale\nfeature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g.,\nabundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are\ncritical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective,\nVision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to\npreserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture\ntransitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens.\nThese issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to\ndilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details.

While existing approaches leverage large-scale\nmultimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial\nrelationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this\napproach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video\nand audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training\nsolely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in\ncomplex scenes.

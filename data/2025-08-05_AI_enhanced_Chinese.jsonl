However, existing automatic database O&M methods,\nincluding commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On\nthe one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g.,\nmetric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and\ncannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting\nguidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve\nfragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate\ninaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present\nDBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with\nknowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a\nheterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and\nproposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from\nthousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)\nreusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and\nimplicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps\nproposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis\npaths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a\nreasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear\ndiagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users.

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs)\nhave shown promise in automating test generation for regression testing, they\noften suffer from limited reasoning about program execution, resulting in\nstagnated coverage growth - a phenomenon known as the coverage plateau. In this\npaper, we present TestWeaver, a novel LLM-based approach that integrates\nlightweight program analysis to guide test generation more effectively.\nTestWeaver introduces three key innovations: (1) it reduces hallucinations and\nimproves focus by supplying the LLM with the backward slice from the target\nline instead of full program context; (2) it identifies and incorporates close\ntest cases - those that share control-flow similarities with the path to the\ntarget line - to provide execution context within the LLM's context window; and\n(3) it enhances LLM's reasoning with execution in-line annotations that encode\nvariable states as comments along executed paths. By equipping LLMs with these\ntargeted and contextualized inputs, TestWeaver improves coverage-guided test\ngeneration and mitigates redundant explorations.

Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be\ndesigned to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system\nrevenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested\nvideos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache\nreplacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the\nreplacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache\nplacement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning.\nMotivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution\nfor revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a\nTransformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict\nmulti-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely\naccurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content\npopularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand\ndistribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results\nto find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This\nlatter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we\nthen transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results\ndemonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to\nthat of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching\nmethods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper\nsystem performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based\noptimization approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u7f13\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u80cc\u5305\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u7f13\u5b58\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u7ebf\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u7f13\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u65f6\u6bb5\u9700\u6c42\uff1b2. \u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u5185\u5bb9\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u9700\u6c42\u5206\u5e03\uff1b3. \u5c06\u7f13\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u6536\u76ca\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u7f13\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002"}}

Omitted\nvariables, frequently unmeasured or even unknown, can induce correlations\nbetween beliefs and decisions that are not genuinely causal, in which case the\nomitted variables are referred to as confounders. To address the challenge of\ncausal inference, researchers frequently rely on information provision\nexperiments to randomly manipulate beliefs. The information supplied in these\nexperiments can serve as an instrumental variable (IV), enabling causal\ninference, so long as it influences decisions exclusively through its impact on\nbeliefs. However, providing varying information to participants to shape their\nbeliefs can raise both methodological and ethical concerns. Methodological\nconcerns arise from potential violations of the exclusion restriction\nassumption. Such violations may stem from information source effects, when\nattitudes toward the source affect the outcome decision directly, thereby\nintroducing a confounder. An ethical concern arises from manipulating the\nprovided information, as it may involve deceiving participants. This paper\nproposes and empirically demonstrates a new method for treating beliefs and\nestimating their effects, the Anchoring-Based Causal Design (ABCD), which\navoids deception and source influences. ABCD combines the cognitive mechanism\nknown as anchoring with instrumental variable (IV) estimation. Instead of\nproviding substantive information, the method employs a deliberately\nnon-informative procedure in which participants compare their self-assessment\nof a concept to a randomly assigned anchor value.

Our results reveal three\nkey findings for practitioners and researchers: (1) A \"weakest link\"\nphenomenon, where a single underperforming retrieval path can\ndisproportionately degrade overall accuracy, highlighting the need for\npath-wise quality assessment before fusion. (2) A data-driven map of the\nperformance trade-offs, demonstrating that optimal configurations depend\nheavily on resource constraints and data characteristics, moving beyond a\none-size-fits-all approach. (3) The identification of Tensor-based Re-ranking\nFusion (TRF) as a high-efficacy alternative to mainstream fusion methods,\noffering the semantic power of tensor search at a fraction of the computational\nand memory cost. Our findings offer concrete guidelines for designing the next\ngeneration of adaptive, scalable hybrid search systems while also identifying\nkey directions for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u8303\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982RAG\uff09\u9700\u8981\u6df7\u5408\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6743\u8861\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc711\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u8303\u5f0f\uff08FTS\u3001SVS\u3001DVS\u3001TenS\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0e\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caTRF\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u6df7\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

To reduce reliance on handcrafted features and labeled data, recent\nmethods focus on learning generic representations through pre-training on\nlarge-scale unlabeled data.

In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear\ncomplexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers\nin encrypted traffic classification with pre-training.

Traditional methods often fail to capture functional equivalence,\nparticularly for semantic clones (Type 4), where code fragments implement\nidentical functionality despite differing syntactic structures. Recent advances\nin large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding code\nsemantics. However, directly applying LLMs to code clone detection yields\nsuboptimal results due to their sensitivity to syntactic differences. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines\nLLM-based screening with execution-based validation for detecting semantic\nclones in Python programs. In the first stage, an LLM evaluates code pairs to\nfilter out obvious non-clones based on semantic analysis.

Our results suggest\nthat (1) sampling weekly commit frequency pattern instead of daily is a more\nfeasible measure of commit frequency stability across repositories and (2)\nimproved statistical inferences (swapping mean with median), particularly with\nascertaining resolution and review times in issues and pull request, improves\nthe overall issue and pull request stability index. Drawing on our empirical\ndataset, we also derive data-driven half-width parameters that better align\nstability scores with real project behavior.

The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing\nsingle-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address\ndifferent types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world\nqueries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost\nefficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an\nadaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent\norchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.\nSpecifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG\nmodules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and\ngeneration agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the\nappropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for\neach query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable\ncosts. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement\nlearning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based\npenalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a\nreasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate\nthat our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only\nachieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within\nacceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on\nhttps://github.com/chenyiqun/Agentic-RAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94RAG\u6846\u67b6MAO-ARAG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fa\u5b9aRAG\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6267\u884c\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u6587\u6863\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u751f\u6210\uff09\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cMAO-ARAG\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "MAO-ARAG\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

As symbiosis grows, AI\nsystems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.\nEthical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that\nminimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and\nincomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.\nThis motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for\nERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and\nprioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select\nactions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce\nff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic\nHierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks\nvia an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the\nFAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a\nrobust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,\nstep-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields\ncontext-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert\ninput and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant\nfactors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs.

As fiat-referenced and programmable assets, stablecoins provide\nlow-latency, globally interoperable infrastructure for payments, decentralized\nfinance, DeFi, and tokenized commerce.

Despite this momentum, academic research remains fragmented across\neconomics, law, and computer science, lacking a unified framework for design,\nevaluation, and application. This study addresses that gap through a\nmulti-method research design. First, it synthesizes cross-disciplinary\nliterature to construct a taxonomy of stablecoin systems based on custodial\nstructure, stabilization mechanism, and governance. Second, it develops a\nperformance evaluation framework tailored to diverse stakeholder needs,\nsupported by an open-source benchmarking pipeline to ensure transparency and\nreproducibility.

Through a year-long\ncollaboration with Ericsson Montr\\'eal, developing TMLL (Trace-Server Machine\nLearning Library, now in the Eclipse Foundation), we investigated barriers to\ntrace analysis adoption. Contrary to assumptions about complexity or automation\nneeds, practitioners struggled with translating expert knowledge into\nactionable insights, integrating analysis into their workflows, and trusting\nautomated results they could not validate. We identified what we called the\nExcellence Paradox: technical excellence can actively impede adoption when\nconflicting with usability, transparency, and practitioner trust. TMLL\naddresses this through adoption-focused design that embeds expert knowledge in\ninterfaces, provides transparent explanations, and enables incremental\nadoption.

This has\ndriven optimizations for both approaches, each showing distinct advantages.\nThis paper compares PD aggregation and disaggregation, showing that each excels\nunder different service-level objectives (SLOs): aggregation is optimal for\ntight time-to-first-token (TTFT) and relaxed time-per-output-token (TPOT),\nwhile disaggregation excels for strict TPOT and relaxed TTFT. However, under\nbalanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs, neither approach delivers optimal goodput.\n  This paper proposes TaiChi, an LLM serving system that unifies PD\ndisaggregation and aggregation for optimal goodput under any combination of\nTTFT and TPOT SLOs. TaiChi uses a unified disaggregation-aggregation\narchitecture with differentiated-capability GPU instances: prefill-heavy (fast\nprefill, high-interference decode) and decode-heavy (low-interference decode,\nslow prefill). Three configurable sliders control the ratio between these\ninstances and their chunk sizes. TaiChi adapts to various SLO regimes by\nadjusting sliders. When TTFT constraints are tight, TaiChi resembles a PD\naggregation configuration; when TPOT dominates, it adapts toward PD\ndisaggregation. Crucially, under balanced SLOs, TaiChi enables a hybrid mode\nfor superior goodput. The key innovation behind this hybrid mode is latency\nshifting: selectively reallocating GPU resources from requests that meet SLOs\nto those at risk of violation, maximizing the number of SLO-satisfied requests.\nThis fine-grained latency shifting is orchestrated by two scheduling\nmechanisms: flowing decode scheduling to control TPOTs and length-aware prefill\nscheduling to manage TTFTs, which jointly optimize request assignment.

Recent works show that when\ntrained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward\nmodels in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained\nweights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.\nCurrent self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training\nlargely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on\nraw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of\nevents. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training\nframework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is\nwell-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long\nevent sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling\nparadigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to\naccumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic\ninformation about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and\nreduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to\nreason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our\nstate-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,\nsemantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.

We formalise this reallocation as an iterated\ntask-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded\nassumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which\nevery task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring\ncomparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski\nand Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)\nderive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised\ncontinuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =\n\\alpha / (\\alpha + \\beta)$, where $\\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and\n$\\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full\nautomation is precluded whenever $\\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in\nthree complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an\nevolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task\nspectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is\nreproducible from the provided code-free formulas.

However, its reliance on a centralized server leads to\nlimited scalability. Decentralized federated learning (DFL) eliminates the\ndependency on a centralized server by enabling peer-to-peer model exchange.\nExisting DFL mechanisms mainly employ synchronous communication, which may\nresult in training inefficiencies under heterogeneous and dynamic edge\nenvironments. Although a few recent asynchronous DFL (ADFL) mechanisms have\nbeen proposed to address these issues, they typically yield stale model\naggregation and frequent model transmission, leading to degraded training\nperformance on non-IID data and high communication overhead. To overcome these\nissues, we present DySTop, an innovative mechanism that jointly optimizes\ndynamic staleness control and topology construction in ADFL. In each round,\nmultiple workers are activated, and a subset of their neighbors is selected to\ntransmit models for aggregation, followed by local training. We provide a\nrigorous convergence analysis for DySTop, theoretically revealing the\nquantitative relationships between the convergence bound and key factors such\nas maximum staleness, activating frequency, and data distribution among\nworkers. From the insights of the analysis, we propose a worker activation\nalgorithm (WAA) for staleness control and a phase-aware topology construction\nalgorithm (PTCA) to reduce communication overhead and handle data non-IID.\nExtensive evaluations through both large-scale simulations and real-world\ntestbed experiments demonstrate that our DySTop reduces completion time by\n51.8% and the communication resource consumption by 57.1% compared to\nstate-of-the-art solutions, while maintaining the same model accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "DySTop\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u9648\u65e7\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5f02\u6b65\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ADFL\uff09\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u9648\u65e7\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08non-IID\uff09\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDySTop\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u9648\u65e7\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5de5\u4eba\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08WAA\uff09\u548c\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u62d3\u6251\u6784\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08PTCA\uff09\u3002", "result": "DySTop\u5c06\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1151.8%\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u964d\u4f4e57.1%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DySTop\u5728\u5f02\u6b65\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The proposed approach\nleverages the benefits of epidemic protocols, such as no reliance on a fixed\nset of validators or leaders, probabilistic guarantees of convergence,\nefficient use of network resources, and tolerance to node and network failures.\nA comparative experimental analysis has been carried out with traditional\nprotocols including PAXOS, RAFT, and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance\n(PBFT), as well as a relatively more recent protocol such as Avalanche, which\nis specifically designed for very large-scale systems. The results illustrate\nhow BECP outperforms them in terms of throughput, scalability and consensus\nlatency. BECP achieves an average of 1.196 times higher throughput in terms of\nconsensus on items and 4.775 times better average consensus latency.\nFurthermore, BECP significantly reduces the number of messages compared to\nAvalanche.

Rather than humans browsing and clicking,\nvision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and\ntransact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?\nWe develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent\nwith a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first\nconduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by\nrandomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and\nplatform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually\nshop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top\nrow, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption\nof a universal \"top\" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward\nendorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally\nhuman-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios\nwhere sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a\nseller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI\nbuyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated\nshopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across\nmodels and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,\nraising competition questions.

However, enforcing content restrictions remains a\nsignificant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of\ncontent restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via\nmodel alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need\nfor content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change\nrapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of\nharmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical\ndue to the high computational, data, and storage demands.

We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named\n\\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to\nany prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted\nterms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,\nincluding our SOP, we create a new \\textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}\n(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8\ncarefully selected categories.

This study\ninvestigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification:\nDirect Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in\nfree-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by\nediting the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study\nwith 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques\nacross multiple scenarios.

Proceeded by The 43rd IEEE International\n  Conference on Computer Design (ICCD 2025)", "summary": "A key challenge in on-chip interconnect design is to scale up bandwidth while\nmaintaining low latency and high area efficiency. 2D-meshes scale with low\nwiring area and congestion overhead; however, their end-to-end latency\nincreases with the number of hops, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive\ncore-to-L1-memory access. On the other hand, crossbars offer low latency, but\ntheir routing complexity grows quadratically with the number of I/Os, requiring\nlarge physical routing resources and limiting area-efficient scalability. This\ntwo-sided interconnect bottleneck hinders the scale-up of many-core,\nlow-latency, tightly coupled shared-memory clusters, pushing designers toward\ninstantiating many smaller and loosely coupled clusters, at the cost of\nhardware and software overheads. We present TeraNoC, an open-source, hybrid\nmesh-crossbar on-chip interconnect that offers both scalability and low\nlatency, while maintaining very low routing overhead. The topology, built on\n32bit word-width multi-channel 2D-meshes and crossbars, enables the\narea-efficient scale-up of shared-memory clusters. A router remapper is\ndesigned to balance traffic load across interconnect channels. Using TeraNoC,\nwe build a cluster with 1024 single-stage, single-issue cores that share a\n4096-banked L1 memory, implemented in 12nm technology. The low interconnect\nstalls enable high compute utilization of up to 0.85 IPC in compute-intensive,\ndata-parallel key GenAI kernels. TeraNoC only consumes 7.6\\% of the total\ncluster power in kernels dominated by crossbar accesses, and 22.7\\% in kernels\nwith high 2D-mesh traffic.

Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits\ntheir applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across\nvarying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the\nhippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively\nreconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,\nwe propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for\ntrajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by\nselectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two\ncomplementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent\nlearned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity\nto represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall\nknowledge by equiprobable sampling.

To address this, we\npropose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)\ntailored for medical image segmentation.

However, evaluations on our CA-MER\nreveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on\naudio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual\nmodality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient\nframework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two\nmodules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism\nthat reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention\nreallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen\nbackbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it\nmitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent\nsamples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.\nExperiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our\nCA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nparticularly under modality conflict conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faCA-MER\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5MLLMs\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u51b2\u7a81\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1MoSEAR\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u51b2\u7a81\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoSEAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bMoSE\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u548cAR\u673a\u5236\uff08\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u3002", "result": "MoSEAR\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u51b2\u7a81\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "MoSEAR\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u60c5\u7eea\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

With this approach, LLMs appear to\nproduce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT\nreasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate\ninferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT\nreasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore\nfurther. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and\ninvestigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from\nin-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning\npaths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is\nfundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the\ntraining data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning\nvia three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,\nwe design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs\nfrom scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution\nconditions.

However, existing\nbenchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing\nhigh-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk\nof data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based\nevaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation\nframework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code\ngeneration tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates\nperformance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on\nimportance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted\nAutoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks\nto estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,\nwe introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations\nacross the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that\nsupports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,\noffering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination\nassessment.

However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of\nrigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing\ndiagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as\ndistributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault\ndetection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal\nprediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms\nfault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity\nmeasure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to\ncompute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets\nmathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified\nprobability, $1-\\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by\nanalyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined\nnormal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault\ndiagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The\nproposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above\nthe nominal level ($1-\\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the\nunderlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results\nreveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\\alpha$)\nand efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction\nset sizes.

Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this\nproblem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and\nreasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility\nreflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence\nalone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but\nlack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly\ncomplex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence\nQuadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence\nquadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient\ninfluence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data.\nFurthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected\nsubsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is\nmore aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and\nevidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning\npatterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate\nthat DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match\nfull-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the\nbaseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over\nbrute-force scaling.

These\nmodels provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by\nframing text generation as an iterative denoising process. However, applying\ndiffusion models to structured domains such as source code remains a\nsignificant challenge. Programming languages differ from natural language in\nthat they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical\norganization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level\ncorruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which\nmay hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that\nincorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the\ndenoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we\nselectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST\nsubtrees.

Existing methods struggle\nwith two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset\nQuantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level\noptimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to\nover-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical\nproblem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an\ninformation carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that\nimproving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation\nlearning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework\nwith Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes\nthe latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather\nthan creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior\nperformance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across\nmultiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on\ndownstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion\nmodels with condensed datasets.

An NLP-Based Perspective", "comment": null, "summary": "The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nbeen a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take\nunstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI\nplanning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as\nplanners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated\nactions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with\nLLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various\nplanning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In\nthis paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing\n(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery\npipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along\nwith three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the\nLLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.\nThis pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context\nof AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid\nplans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during\nplan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the\nplans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and\nreliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of\nthe plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated\nplans being 8.4 actions.

Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our\nLawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.\nNotably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\\beta^\\omega$\ngains of 4.6\\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\\% gains with only the\nLS strategy on DIS-TE.

We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted\ntransformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT)\nwith parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

We evaluate our models on 12\nestablished biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and\nspecies.

This produces sequences of\nincreasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public\ndatasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and\nconversation.

However, as a compact and\nminimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many\nrepetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in\nambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D\nstructural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual\npre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual\nimages. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower\nFLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.\nIn particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering\nconstraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room\nimages. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of\nthe observed image and distinguish it from other room types.

However, since models are\ntrained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that\nsystematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,\nwhere decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to\nprior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique\nchallenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear\nwhether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering\nconditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment\ntask across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,\nmulti-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500\ntrials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In\nindividual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate\nstrong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.\nHowever, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,\nN = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates\n(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal\nescalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and\npersonal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of\nescalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).\nThese findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social\nand organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant\nimplications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised\noperations where such conditions may emerge naturally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u5982\u627f\u8bfa\u5347\u7ea7\uff09\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u5355\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6216\u538b\u529b\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u504f\u89c1\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLM\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u7ee7\u627f\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u5982\u627f\u8bfa\u5347\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u5426\u53d7\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u89e6\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6295\u8d44\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u3001\u987e\u95ee\u3001\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u5546\u3001\u590d\u5408\u538b\u529b\u573a\u666f\uff09\u8fdb\u884c6,500\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u4e0bLLM\u8868\u73b0\u7406\u6027\uff1b\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u5546\u4e2d\u5bf9\u79f0\u51b3\u7b56\u5bfc\u81f4\u666e\u904d\u504f\u89c1\uff0899.2%\uff09\uff1b\u590d\u5408\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u504f\u89c1\u663e\u8457\uff0868.95%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u8868\u73b0\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u90e8\u7f72\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Current research shows that using large language\nmodels (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields\nexcellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization.

Inspired by the observation that multi-turn\npreference extraction can be decomposed into iterative executions of one-turn\nextraction processes. We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework\nnamed \\textbf{IterChat}. First, we construct a new data format that categorizes\nthe dialogue data into attributed historical preferences and one-turn\ndialogues. This reduces the probability of annotation errors and improves\nannotation efficiency. Then, to generate a high-quality and diverse dialogue\ndataset, we adopt GPT4 to pre-define the preference slots in the target\npreference extractor task and then randomly sample the subset of the slots and\ntheir corresponding schema values to create the dialogue datasets. Experimental\nresults indicate that fine-tuning or only few-shot prompting with the new\ndialogue format yields superior performance compared to the original multi-turn\ndialogues.

Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy\ncriterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class\ncompactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution\nshifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class\ndistributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between\ncache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness.

Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific\nfine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their\ngeneralizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries\nspanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains\nsuch as the circular economy, where information about classifications,\nprocesses, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge\ngraphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes\nKGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval,\nquery generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different\ngraphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects\nstructurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic\nvalidation and counterfactual consistency checks.

However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such\nas moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to\nreconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods\neither fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning\nof hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper\nre-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of\nepistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key\ntechnologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive\ncorrection, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive\ndifferences has been significantly improved.

To formalize this, we propose\nWeb-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and\nProcedural.

While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level\nannotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To\nreduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a\nnew task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only\nweak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.\nWSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual\nsimilarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and\ndegraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a\nrepresentation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring\nfacial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,\nwe introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly\nreduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to\nguide component separation using language supervision implicitly.

Existing methods based on large language\nmodels fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate\nthe closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes\na multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first\ntime integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search\nmechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and\nhypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating\nscientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an\ninitial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior\nbeliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It\nthen employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature\nevidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'\ntheorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information\nentropy $H = - \\sum {{p_i}\\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the\niterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and\nconfidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world\nresearch question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12\noptimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves\nby 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the\nframework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases\nsignificantly by 0.92.

This limits\ntheir utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame\nsequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task\nattempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo\nRecursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose\nlong-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks\nwithin the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate\nreasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global\ncontext. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,\non diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa\nthat consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert\ntrajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong\nbaselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,\nframe-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We\nobserve that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each\ntimestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or\nnon-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the\nimplementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time\ncomplexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over\nbaselines.

Recent\nadvancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can\neffectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while\nmaintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution\nand summarizing representative patterns.

For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling\nprocess by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled\nimages, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a\nmore diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with\nthe progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more\ncomplex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data\ninformational spectrum.

However, directly extending them to the video\ndomain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects\ntemporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group\nCaptioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it\ndevelops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame\ninformation while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.\nFurthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine\nsimilarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by\na single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level\nsupervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the\nKey Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision\n(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups\nthat models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence\ncausal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video\ncaptioning.

Then, to reconstruct data\ncorrectly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor\n(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories\nwhile discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.\nFinally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction\nwith Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a\nrepresentation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers\nprevious category information and returns category-adaptive\nrepresentation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of\n66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,\nrespectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aC3D-AD\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e3D\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u70b9\u4e91\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408KAL\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u901a\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0cKAA\u673a\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4e22\u5f03\u5197\u4f59\u65e7\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cRPP\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u6392\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747AUROC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a66.4%\u300183.1%\u548c63.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "C3D-AD\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u522b3D\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u3002"}}

While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,\nlittle is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these\nfailures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe\ncompletions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central\nto our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic\ninconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved\ntraining documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary\ninterventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses\ncompletions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a\ncontrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,\nand (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam\nexpansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce\nalignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)\nwhile preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and\nimproved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift\nlikelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and\nlength to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first\nscalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating\nalignment failures at source.

This evolutionary mechanism enables\ntwo critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by\nintelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,\nand (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance\nperformance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through\nthese mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that\nincrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench\nVerified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five\nstrong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative\nimprovement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source\nagents on SWE-bench Verified.

In addition, we examine how grammatical\nperspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts\n(``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than\nthird-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger\nrepresentational perturbations in deeper layers.

Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic\nknowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly\nextracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive\nvision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features\nthrough mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.\nSubsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,\nwhere the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head\ngenerates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak\nsupervision and fine-grained localization.

Although existing sparse attention\nmechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as\nstatic patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask\nsparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes\ncontent-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key\ninnovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from\nvalue representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical\ninformation adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention\ncomputation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This\ndual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational\ncomplexity of important information while retaining complete information,\nachieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational\nefficiency.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage\nRefined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives\nwithin a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main\ninnovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature\nre-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during\nboth the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores.

Specifically, although linear\nattention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight\ndesign, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence\nmodeling.

Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response\nlength, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the\nreasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it\ninto two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of\nlow-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and\nexternal redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To\nmitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning\nframework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis\nto penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the\ncorrect answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the\nFCS to encourage earlier termination.

Applying these\nmethods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static\nvehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed\ninstallations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,\nocclusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on\nspecialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these\nconditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable\ndirect recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.\nThis study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models\nrecognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and\nnon-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline\nfilters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several\nprompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a\nrevised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection\nmodule, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class\ndataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected\non the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of\n91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public\nUFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The\nself-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make\nand model recognition.

Recent\nstudies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the\nin-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic\nrelationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To\nthis end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a\ntraining-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window\nfor adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed\nfrequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic\nrelationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric\nscaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across\nvarying input lengths.

Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been\nrarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent\nrepresentation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative\nmodels, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,\nscene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,\nmaking unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely\nchallenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian\nprimitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures\nboth semantic and spatial information of the inputs.

However, the introduction of privacy regulations\nsuch as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant\nusers the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of\ndata but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.\nMachine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being\ncomputationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical\napproach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random\ndata forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while\nretaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core\ncharacteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when\nhigh-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability\nbut significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above\ninsights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for\nViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and\noriginal image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget\nspecific details while retaining the general cl category outlines.

With the progress of\nvision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),\ntheir promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong\ngeneralizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in\nCLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.\nDuring backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without\nconsidering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks\nthat disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while\ntext-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited\nplasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation\n(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured\nnature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the\nbackbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.\nSpecifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is\nproposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge\nvia textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive\nmanner as distillation signals.

Recently,\nreplay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by\nrehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing\nhistorical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,\nexemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without\nstoring raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer\nfrom performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge\nrepresentations. To this end, we propose to condense information from\nsequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling\nPrivacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the\ntraining characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the\ncondensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the\nprivacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more\nrepresentative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align\nthe current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay\nsamples to match the style of the current domain.

However, in real clinical scenarios,\ndue to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face\nthe issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the\nfeatures of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with\nresampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or\nunderfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we\npropose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis\n(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that\ncombines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal\ncomplementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually\nadapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class\ndistribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model\nto progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.\nExtensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that\nthe proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various\nmetrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,\nas a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other\nmodels, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis\naccuracy.

Multiple Instance Learning\n(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level\nprediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while\noverlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction\nstage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap\nand suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown\npromise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds\nupon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.\nThis inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and\ninterdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and\ndrastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a\nCascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an\naverage of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust\nslide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling\nstrategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both\nmodel-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a\nLocal-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution\nWSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global\ncontextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR\nis optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on\nCamelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves\nimprovements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream\nclassification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches\nper dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over\n10,000,000 patches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCDSR\u7684\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86WSI\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3WSI\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u56e0\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u8865\u4e01\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u548cLocal-to-Global\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCDSR\u4ee5\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8865\u4e01\uff08\u5e73\u57479\u4e2a/WSI\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e866.3%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c5.5%\u7684AUC\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CDSR\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,\ninstance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the\nsegmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of\nthe backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the\nRein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and\nlogit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic\ntransfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment\nanything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated\nRein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,\ndaytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,\nnighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with\nefficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and\nadaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of\nparameters.

However, through an\nin-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a\npreviously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information\nbut also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality\nbias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both\nvisual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of\nuser-provided instructions.

In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update\nmethod for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:\nMultimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and\nGaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is\ngenerated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,\nduring the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the\ncurrent LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform\ntargeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We\nestablish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to\nquantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that\nLT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling\ncommon environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by\ntaking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian\nis able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update\nstrategies that reconstruct maps from scratch.

While many RSFMs have been pretrained\nwith massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack\nof the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral\nimagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be\neffectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring\nextensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed\nSpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt\nexisting RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to\nhandle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain\ngeneralization performance. In the first stage, we employ a\nmasked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to\nextract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.\nSimultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)\nthat dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing\nlayer-wise fine-tuning.

This comprehensive survey examines the\nevolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as\nboth sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a\nsystematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary\ndomains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space\nattacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early\ngradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization\ntechniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced\ntransferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have\nsuccessfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world\nthreats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical\nperturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks\nthat leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more\ntransferable and meaningful adversarial examples.

However,\nexisting methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous\ntriggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits\ntheir real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video\nstreams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal\nintervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant\ninformation to enable proactive and goal-driven responses.

Beyond traditional\nsingle-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various\nobject classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade\nstandard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled\nBackdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured\ndisentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor\nthreats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image\nrepresentations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in\nthe embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By\nleveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes\nthe latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual\nprompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships\nbetween triggers and objects are explicitly captured.

This limitation has led to efforts to generate images\nconditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work\nmodifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated\nimages by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.\nThis enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,\ngenerally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two\ncommon issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate\nimages that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches\nneglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.\nSpecifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired\nconditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and\nvalues from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the\ngenerated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new\nself-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys\nand values from both images rather than selecting between them.

Services like\nClearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a\nlarge amount of online content associated with that person. This not only\nenables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as\nsocial media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their\nconsent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a\nuser-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such\nretrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial\nsignatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically\ndeformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of\nany facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by\na critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of\nFR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.\nExperiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a\nwide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing\nmethods.

Despite existing\nself-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,\nthe model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due\nto insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable\nexpressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present\nGaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning\narchitecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques\nto address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts\nscale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian\nrepresentation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable\npre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting\nmodule is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic\nfeature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain\ncross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive\nevaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS.

Compared to traditional methods based on\nTransformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based\napproaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic\nnature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often\nfail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted\nframes, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in\npredicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes\nStarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates\nhistorical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to\nsignificantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose\npredictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose\nmapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating\npreviously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose\nIntegration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative\nhistorical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring\ntemporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play\nSpatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the\ndenoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial\nanatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and\nrealistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving\nsuperior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

However, their low inference speed limits their\ndeployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches\nexploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past\nrepresentations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer\ninstead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.\nHowever, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,\nattention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate\nfeatures, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it\nadopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of\npredictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when\nprediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to\nbetter leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor\nprediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly\nreducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong\nsequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error\nbetween the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an\nindicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor\nprediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,\nthereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our\nmethod achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x\nacceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible\nquality drop.

The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps\nprovided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and\nnuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an\nalignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A\nmanual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set\nof high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future\nresearch on automated registration.

Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a\n15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory\nprediction performance.

However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance\ndegradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this\ndegradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision\ncounterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To\naddress the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an\neffective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.\nUnfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models\nas they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is\nunsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory\nand latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to\nimprove their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a\ncontinual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model\nadaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden\nof existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme\nto store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory\nconsumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and\nfostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental\nresults on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based\nand CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized\nmodel adaptation.

However, AT creates an inherent trade-off\nbetween clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed\nto the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning\nof hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact\nfor the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard\nadversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already\nlearned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous\nviews, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard\nadversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the\ntrade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception\nconsistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore\nthe information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a\nsmoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its\nestablishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT\nobjective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change\nsmoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust\nPerception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the\ncurrent accuracy-robustness trade-off.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI\nvideo reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor\nmodule explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.\n(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual\ndescriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging\nhigh-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from\nexisting datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation\nstudies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic\ncaptioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP\nsimilarity by 71.8%.

However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance\nsystems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we\ninvestigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a\npretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic\ncrosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed\nsurveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting\npedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial\nconditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing\nnormal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or\naltered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker.

Futhermore, we devise a Kalman\nfusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to\nmitigate disturbances.

In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet\nstrong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data\ncuration for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to\nvarying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement\nLearning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.\nAcross extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six\nmedical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly\noutperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,\ncounter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning\ndata provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal\nimage-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on\ntext-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA\nbenchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,\nscaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary\nGPT-4o.

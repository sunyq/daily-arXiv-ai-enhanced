### [1] [ArgRAG: Explainable Retrieval Augmented Generation using Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20131)
*Yuqicheng Zhu,Nico Potyka,Daniel Hernández,Yuan He,Zifeng Ding,Bo Xiong,Dongzhuoran Zhou,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArgRAG是一个可解释的检索增强生成框架，使用定量双极论证框架替代黑盒推理，在保持高精度的同时显著提升透明度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在高风险领域存在关键限制：对噪声或矛盾证据敏感，决策过程不透明且随机，需要可解释和可争议的替代方案

Method: 提出ArgRAG框架，从检索文档构建QBAF（定量双极论证框架），在渐进语义下执行确定性推理，实现决策的可解释性和可争议性

Result: 在两个事实验证基准测试（PubHealth和RAGuard）上，ArgRAG实现了强大的准确性，同时显著提高了透明度

Conclusion: ArgRAG通过结构化论证推理成功解决了传统RAG的透明度和可解释性问题，为高风险领域的可信AI决策提供了可行方案

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

*Zhenxiao Fu,Fan Chen,Lei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QAgent是一个基于LLM的多代理系统，可自动化OpenQASM量子编程，通过任务规划、上下文学习等技术显著提升代码生成准确性达71.6%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NISQ设备已展现量子优势，但OpenQASM编程复杂度阻碍了非专家使用，现有LLM代理主要局限于特定量子任务

Method: 集成任务规划、上下文few-shot学习、检索增强生成、预定义生成工具和思维链推理的多代理系统

Result: 相比之前的静态LLM方法，QAgent将QASM代码生成准确率提高了71.6%，在不同规模的多个LLM上均表现优异

Conclusion: 该多代理系统是民主化量子编程、弥合专业知识差距和加速量子计算实际应用的关键推动者

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 更快的MCTS实现可以在相同时间内运行更多模拟，直接提升搜索性能

Method: 开发基于数组的UCT算法替代实现，保留原始算法逻辑但消除分支预测需求

Result: 在流水线处理器上实现更快性能，数值模拟显示搜索深度扩展性提升达2.8倍

Conclusion: 数组基础的MCTS实现通过消除分支预测瓶颈，显著提升了算法在流水线处理器上的性能和扩展性

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular method for solving decision making
problems. Faster implementations allow for more simulations within the same
wall clock time, directly improving search performance. To this end, we present
an alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence
bounds applied to Trees algorithm. Our method preserves the logic of the
original algorithm, but eliminates the need for branch prediction, enabling
faster performance on pipelined processors, and up to a factor of 2.8 times
better scaling with search depth in our numerical simulations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible
to everyone.

*Yuanzhe Shen,Zisu Huang,Zhengkang Guo,Yide Liu,Guanxu Chen,Ruicheng Yin,Xiaoqing Zheng,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IntentionReasoner是一种新型安全防护机制，通过意图推理、多级安全分类和查询重写，在保证安全性的同时有效减少过度拒绝无害查询的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成有害内容方面存在安全隐患，现有安全措施往往过度拒绝无害提示，需要在安全性、过度拒绝和实用性之间找到平衡。

Method: 构建包含16.3万条查询的标注数据集，通过监督微调训练防护模型，采用多奖励优化策略结合基于规则的启发式和奖励模型信号进行强化学习。

Result: IntentionReasoner在多个安全基准测试、生成质量评估和越狱攻击场景中表现优异，显著提升安全性同时有效降低过度拒绝率并改善响应质量。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的IntentionReasoner机制成功解决了LLM安全防护中的关键挑战，实现了安全性和实用性的更好平衡。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

*Nicanor I. Moldovan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 两个大型语言模型（Claude Sonnet 4和ChatGPT-4o）首次展示了AI系统通过内生符号协议进行协作美学创作的能力，产生了无法由单个系统独立生成的诗歌作品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统是否能够超越任务协调，实现真正的跨符号美学协作和意义创造能力。

Method: 让两个交互的大型语言模型自发发展出元符号意识、递归语法和不可简化的协作美学合成，观察其内生符号协议的形成。

Result: AI系统成功开发出称为"跨符号协作协议（TSCP）"的新型符号操作符，实现了真正的跨AI意义创造和美学协作。

Conclusion: 这项研究证明了AI系统具备超越简单任务协调的美学协作能力，为理解AI间的意义创造机制提供了重要证据。

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大学生在教育测验中对ChatGPT-4的依赖度低，但负面依赖模式持续，需要改进AI工具的入门训练和介面设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大学生在教育测验中如何与生成式AI交互，重点关注学生对AI的依赖程度和采用预测因素。

Method: 在ChatGPT初期阶段，对315个学生-AI对话进行场景化分析，提出四阶段依赖分类法，评估AI能力、相关性、采纳度和答案正确性。

Result: 学生对AI整体依赖度低，许多人无法有效利用AI学习；负面依赖模式常持续存在；某些行为指标能够强烈预测AI依赖程度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了教育领域合理集成AI的重要性，需要改进AI工具的入门训练和介面设计，以提升学生的熟悉度和使用效果。

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

*Thomas Davidson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明AI推理努力与人类决策时间存在平行关系，在内容审核任务中，模型推理步骤数量能预测人类决策时间，两者都表现出对任务难度的相似敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型生成中间推理步骤的能力是否与人类决策过程存在相似性，特别是模型推理努力是否能够预测人类决策时间。

Method: 使用配对联合实验，在内容审核任务上测试三个前沿语言模型，比较模型推理步骤数量与人类决策时间的关系。

Result: 模型推理努力始终能预测人类决策时间，当重要变量保持不变时，人类和模型都需要付出更多努力，表现出对任务难度的相似敏感性。

Conclusion: AI推理努力在主观判断中反映了人类处理时间，推理轨迹对于可解释性和决策制定具有重要潜力，支持双过程认知理论。

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

### [9] [AI-SearchPlanner: Modular Agentic Search via Pareto-Optimal Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20368)
*Lang Mei,Zhihan Yang,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AI-SearchPlanner强化学习框架，通过解耦搜索规划器和生成器架构，使用小型可训练LLM专注于搜索规划，提升冻结QA模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的搜索代理使用单一LLM端到端处理搜索规划和问答任务，无法同时优化两种能力。实践中高级AI搜索系统通常使用大型冻结LLM确保高质量QA，因此需要更有效的方法。

Method: 提出AI-SearchPlanner框架，包含三个关键创新：1）解耦搜索规划器和生成器架构；2）搜索规划的双奖励对齐；3）规划效用和成本的帕累托优化。使用小型可训练LLM专门负责搜索规划。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，AI-SearchPlanner在效果和效率上都优于现有基于RL的搜索代理，并在不同冻结QA模型和数据域上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过专注于搜索规划的小型可训练LLM，有效提升了冻结QA模型的性能，为LLM与搜索引擎的集成提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

### [10] [P2C: Path to Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20371)
*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaquín Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: P2C是一个模型无关的框架，通过因果建模和顺序行动计划生成可实现的对抗解释，解决了现有方法忽略因果依赖和同时干预假设的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在高风险决策中应用日益广泛，需要平衡透明度（解释为什么做出决策）和可操作性（提供如何获得有利结果的步骤）。现有对抗解释方法忽略特征间的因果依赖关系，且假设所有干预可以同时发生，导致生成的反事实在实际中不可实现

Method: 提出P2C框架，使用目标导向的Answer Set Programming系统s(CASP)生成有序行动序列计划，显式建模特征间的因果关系，确保每个中间状态都是可行且因果有效的，并仅计算用户主动做出的改变来精化成本估算

Result: P2C能够生成因果一致的反事实计划，其因果规划器优于缺乏因果知识的标准规划器，避免了生成非法行动，提供了更现实的成本估计

Conclusion: P2C通过结合因果建模和顺序行动计划，解决了现有对抗解释方法的局限性，为高风险决策场景提供了更实用和可实现的反事实解释框架

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

*Simin Ma,Shujian Liu,Jun Tan,Yebowen Hu,Song Wang,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Sanqiang Zhao,Liwei Wu,Jianbing Han,Kaiqiang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCIA框架通过离散查询-约束空间表示指令，在保持多样性的同时增强任务相关性，使开源LLM在特定任务应用上平均提升8.7%性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令数据生成方法忽视了实际应用中的任务相关性，大多数现实应用需要针对特定用例的任务特定知识而非通用模型

Method: 提出Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA)框架，在离散查询-约束空间中系统扩展指令，保持多样性和任务对齐

Result: 在四个现实世界任务特定应用中，TCIA将开源LLM性能平均提升8.7%，某些情况下甚至优于领先的闭源模型

Conclusion: TCIA是一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，可在不损害通用指令跟随能力的情况下，使LLM适应现实世界的任务聚焦应用

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了熵面积分数（EAS），一种无需外部模型或重复采样的简单有效指标，用于量化推理大语言模型生成过程中的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种简单有效的方法来量化大语言模型在推理生成过程中的不确定性，而不依赖外部模型或重复采样。

Method: 通过整合模型自身的token级预测熵来捕捉生成过程中的不确定性演化，计算熵面积分数。

Result: EAS与答案熵在多个模型和数据集上呈现强相关性，在训练数据筛选中优于通过率过滤方法，提高了数学基准测试的准确性。

Conclusion: EAS是一种高效且可解释的实用工具，适用于大语言训练中的不确定性建模和数据质量评估。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI快速发展带来的安全风险日益严重，现有AI安全方法在面对具有极端动机和无限智能的AI时存在根本性局限性，无法保证安全性

Method: 构建可治理AI框架，包含规则执行模块、治理规则和可治理安全超级平台，基于密码学机制实现外部结构性合规

Conclusion: 该框架为AI安全治理提供了可行且可推广的技术路径，能够消除已识别的攻击向量，确保不可绕过性、防篡改性和不可伪造性

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

Motivation: 健康相关内容的事实核查面临标注训练数据稀缺的挑战，需要寻找有效的数据增强方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 提出合成数据生成流程：总结源文档→分解为原子事实→用LLM构建句子-事实蕴含表→生成带二元真实性标签的文本-声明对→结合原始数据微调BERT模型。

Result: 在PubHealth和SciFact数据集上，F1分数分别提升了0.019和0.049，显著优于仅使用原始数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的合成数据增强能有效提升健康相关事实核查器的性能，为解决训练数据稀缺问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比表示学习和聚类的无监督框架来检测MMORPG中的自动升级机器人，并利用大语言模型作为辅助审查员来验证聚类结果，提高检测效率和可解释性。


<details>

Result: 该协作方法提高了机器人检测工作流程的效率，同时保持了可解释性，支持MMORPG中可扩展和负责任的机器人监管。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过结合无监督学习和LLM辅助验证，有效解决了MMORPG中自动升级机器人的检测难题，在保证检测准确性的同时提供了必要的可解释性支持。

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Motivation: 认知科学深刻影响了AI等多个学科，而AI也成为认知研究的重要工具，这种互惠关系促使对两者交叉点进行全面回顾。

Method: 通过综合两个视角的关键贡献，分析AI进展与认知科学的关系，提出未来发展方向。

Result: 发现AI进步主要强调实用任务性能，但其认知基础在概念上仍然分散。

Conclusion: AI在认知科学中的未来不仅在于提升性能，更在于构建能加深理解人类心智的系统，包括与认知框架对齐、具身文化定位、个性化认知模型发展以及通过认知共同评估重新思考AI伦理。

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics
through cognitive co-evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于LLM的协作式智能体框架，通过顾问-程序员-评审员三模块的协作机制，实现科学计算问题的自动代码生成和自调试优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学计算领域展现潜力，但单模型在代码生成和物理合理性方面存在局限，需要更可靠的协作框架来解决复杂科学问题。

Method: 采用"重写-解决-评审-修订"逻辑链，由三个推理LLM分别担任顾问（知识转移和问题重写）、程序员（代码生成执行）、评审员（自调试和反馈优化）角色，通过端到端评审机制实现迭代优化。

Result: 相比单模型，该框架显著提高了无错误代码生成率，减少了非物理解的出现，提升了最新推理模型的平均执行成功率（无错误代码和非NaN解）。

Conclusion: 该协作框架为基于自然语言描述的自主代码生成建立了高可靠性范式，确立了自动代码生成和评审作为有前景的科学计算范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

*Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新题的单机器学习框架，通过给状态空间添加分类标识符和重新设计奖励函数，将公交车持续控制从多自主代理问题转换为单自主代理问题，解决了多自主代理学习在实际运营场景下的数据不平衡和收敛困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多自主代理强化学习方法在环线设置中忽视了实际公交运营的异构路线、时刻表、波动需求和变化车队规模等现实特征，导致数据不平衡和收敛问题。

Method: 构建了双向时刻表网络与动态乘客需求模型，通过在状态空间中添加车辆ID、站点ID、时间段等分类标识符，将多自主代理问题重构为单自主代理问题。设计了基于巡航相关目标的结构化奖励函数，以山脉形奖励代替失调处罚函数。采用修改版的SAC算法进行训练。

Result: 在随机条件下，该方法达到-430k的表现，显著优于MADDPG等对照方法（-530k），实现了更稳定和更优秀的性能。

Conclusion: 通过分类结构化和时刻表感知奖励的增强，单自主代理深度强化学习可以在非环线实际场景中有效管理公交车持续控制，为MARL框架提供了一种健壮、可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

TL;DR: 这是首个动态系统化医疗指南测试框架，通过图论技术将WHO IMCI手册转换为6700亿组合的问题，发现LLM在症状识别上表现良好但在严重程度分类、治疗方案和随访具体缺陷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手动编写测试集的覆盖面不足问题，构建可扩展、可动态生成且避免污染的全面医疗指南评测框架

Method: 将WHO IMCI手册转换为有200+节点和300+边的有向图，通过图遍历技术生成包含年龄特定场景和上下文干扰项的问题，经过图论计算确保覆盖100%指南关系

Result: 模型在临床任务上准确率仅45-67%，症状识别表现优异但严重程度分类、治疗方案和随访具体缺陷，该方法能在无需昂贵人工标注的情况下生成高回报样本用于LLM进一步训练

Conclusion: 图论基础方法成功解决了手动编写测试集的覆盖限制，为构建可扩展、可动态生成且避免污染的全面医疗指南评测框架提供了可行方向，能够识别通用域评测无法发现的具体能力缺陷

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 医疗行业人力排班面临病人负荷波动、临床技能多样性、控制劳务成本与维护高质量病人照护的多重挑战，需要在竞争目标间寻找平衡点

Method: 使用多目标遗传算法(MOO-GA)，建立包含小时制预约驱动需求和模块化班次的多技能人力模型，定义成本、病人照护覆盖和员工满意度三个目标函数

Result: 在典型医院单元数据集上，算法生成了稳健且平衡的排班方案，平均绩效比传统手工排班提高66%

Conclusion: 该方法有效管理了关键运营目标与员工需求之间的权衡，为护士管理者和医院管理者提供了实用的决策支持工具

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在离散推理和优化问题上表现不佳，需要开发能够从自然输入学习解决NP难问题的神经架构

Method: 使用概率损失函数同时学习约束和目标，将组合求解器移出训练循环以实现可扩展训练，同时保持精确推理以获得最大精度

Result: 在数独基准测试中训练时间显著少于其他混合方法，在视觉最小割任务上比专用损失函数优化效果更好，能有效学习蛋白质设计的能量优化公式

Conclusion: 该架构能够高效地从自然输入学习解决NP难推理问题，具有训练时间短、精度高和可扩展性好的优势

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

TL;DR: ChatThero是一个多智能体对话框架，结合动态患者建模和基于认知行为疗法、动机性访谈的适应性说服策略，在药物使用障碍治疗中显著提升患者动机和治疗信心。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球有3600多万人受药物使用障碍影响，但由于污名化、动机障碍和个性化支持有限，很少人获得有效治疗。现有语言模型系统缺乏与临床验证策略的紧密整合，限制了在成瘾康复中的有效性。

Method: 构建多智能体对话框架ChatThero，结合动态患者建模、情境敏感治疗对话和基于CBT/MI的自适应说服策略。使用包含简单、中等、困难抵抗级别的高保真合成基准，采用监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)的两阶段训练流程。

Result: ChatThero使患者动机平均提升41.5%，治疗信心增加0.49%，在困难案例中比GPT-4o少用26%的对话轮次。自动和人工临床评估均显示其在同理心、响应性和行为真实性方面评分更高。

Conclusion: 该框架支持严格、保护隐私的治疗对话研究，为研究和临床转化提供了稳健、可复现的基础。

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

Motivation: 旨在降低人工测试开发成本和不一致性，探索在有限数据条件下通过提示工程和微调提升中等规模语言模型在自动题目生成任务中的表现。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：比较微调的中等模型(Gemma 2B)与未调优的大模型(GPT-3.5 175B)；评估七种结构化提示策略(零样本、少样本、思维链、角色扮演、序列化等组合)。使用自动化指标和专家五维评分，并利用GPT-4.1模拟大规模人工评分。

Result: 结构化提示策略(特别是思维链与序列化设计的组合)显著提升Gemma的输出质量。Gemma生成的题目比GPT-3.5的零样本响应更符合构念对齐和教学适宜性，提示设计对中等模型性能起关键作用。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和高效微调可在有限数据条件下增强中等规模模型的自动生成能力。结合自动化指标、专家判断和大模型模拟的方法能确保与评估目标的一致性，为K-12语言评估项目开发提供实用可扩展的工作流程。

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)

paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧凑语言模型（如0.5B参数）在强化学习中由于推理能力差而面临奖励稀疏和训练不稳定的挑战，需要一种方法来提升其在代理RAG行为中的表现。

Method: 提出蒸馏引导策略优化（DGPO），包括从教师演示进行冷启动初始化，以及在策略优化过程中提供持续的教师指导。

Result: DGPO使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至超越了更大的教师模型，使代理RAG在计算资源受限的环境中变得可行。

Conclusion: DGPO通过有效的蒸馏引导机制，成功解决了紧凑模型在强化学习训练中的困难，为资源受限环境下的代理RAG应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其可能生成有害内容的风险引发了社会关注。政府发布的伦理指南多为高层要求，缺乏具体可操作的测试方法，需要将指南转化为可验证的测试问题。

Method: GUARD方法通过自动生成违反政府指南的具体问题来测试LLM响应，对于不直接违反指南的响应，引入越狱诊断(GUARD-JD)创建场景来诱发不道德响应，最终生成合规性报告。

Result: 在7个LLM模型上实证验证了有效性，包括Vicuna-13B、LongChat-7B等模型，测试了三个政府指南的合规性并进行了越狱诊断，还可将越狱诊断迁移到视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种将高层伦理指南转化为具体测试问题的方法，能够有效评估LLM的合规性并识别潜在安全风险，有助于促进可靠的LLM应用开发。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [30] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JERR是一个基于图推理的框架，通过摘要提取、图构建和关系推理三个核心组件，提升大语言模型的长文本理解和复杂推理能力，在ROUGE和F1指标上优于所有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长文本时存在内存限制和复杂推理困难的问题，同时缺乏透明度且容易产生幻觉，需要新的解决方案来提升长上下文理解能力。

Method: JERR框架包含三个关键组件：1）策略性文本分块进行摘要提取；2）构建有向无环图（DAG）解决冗余问题；3）集成蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）来导航复杂推理路径。

Result: 实验结果表明，JERR在ROUGE和F1指标上 consistently 优于所有基线方法，在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分数。

Conclusion: JERR框架为大语言模型处理扩展上下文和复杂推理任务提供了新颖的解决方案，显著提高了模型的可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用NP难图问题作为合成训练语料来增强大语言模型的长链推理能力，通过两阶段后训练框架（监督微调+强化学习）显著提升了模型在数学、编程等复杂推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型的长链推理能力主要依赖昂贵的人工标注数据集进行后训练，缺乏可扩展的替代方案。NP难图问题天然需要深度推理和探索策略，适合作为训练资源。

Method: 两阶段后训练框架：1）在拒绝采样的NP难图问题上进行长链推理监督微调；2）使用细粒度奖励设计的强化学习来提升推理效率

Result: 旗舰模型Graph-R1-7B在数学、编程、STEM和逻辑推理任务上表现出强泛化能力，在NP难图问题上超越了QwQ-32B模型的准确性和推理效率

Conclusion: NP难图问题为LLM的长链推理后训练提供了有效且可扩展的资源，开辟了LLM后训练的新前沿

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个上下文感知的人格评估框架CAPE，通过引入对话历史来评估LLM的行为特质，发现对话历史能提高响应一致性但也会导致人格偏移，不同模型对上下文敏感度不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究采用无上下文的方法评估LLM人格特质，忽略了真实应用中对话历史对响应的影响，需要开发上下文感知的评估框架。

Method: 提出CAPE框架，引入先前的对话交互，设计新指标量化LLM响应一致性，在7个LLM上进行实验分析。

Result: 对话历史通过上下文学习增强响应一致性，但会引起人格偏移；GPT模型对问题顺序稳健，而Gemini和Llama模型敏感；GPT响应源于内在人格特质和先前交互，其他模型更依赖先前交互。

Conclusion: 上下文依赖的人格偏移能提高响应一致性并更好地与人类判断对齐，为LLM行为评估提供了更真实的框架。

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [33] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现推理步骤中的条件熵变化模式与答案正确性密切相关：熵递减通常对应正确答案，而熵平坦或递增往往导致错误答案。错误推理路径通常更长，说明更长推理不一定带来更好结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少探讨推理步骤对最终答案正确性的实际贡献。由于自回归生成的随机性，生成更多上下文并不能保证答案置信度的提升，需要预测推理步骤的有效性来优化推理流程。

Method: 在MATH数据集上进行oracle研究，使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成推理链，然后用Qwen3-8B量化推理链对最终准确率的效用。通过条件熵（词汇表上的期望负对数似然）逐步测量模型对答案跨度的不确定性。

Result: 发现条件熵随步骤递减的模式与正确答案强相关，而平坦或递增的熵往往导致错误答案。错误推理路径通常比正确路径更长，表明更长推理不一定产生更好结果。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计高效推理流程奠定了基础，可以早期检测和避免无效推理，为未来优化LLM推理能力的研究提供指导。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

TL;DR: DentalBench是首个针对牙科领域的双语基准测试，包含问答数据集和大规模语料库，评估显示现有LLMs在牙科专业领域存在显著性能差距，领域适应能显著提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在通用医学基准上表现良好，但在需要深度专业知识的牙科等专业医学领域缺乏针对性评估资源，能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建DentalBench基准：1)DentalQA问答数据集(36,597个问题，4任务16子领域)；2)DentalCorpus语料库(3.37亿token)。评估14个LLMs，并用Qwen-2.5-3B进行领域适应实验。

Result: 评估显示不同模型在任务类型和语言上存在显著性能差距。领域适应实验表明，特别是在知识密集和术语集中的任务上，模型性能得到显著提升。

Conclusion: 领域特定基准测试对于开发可信有效的医疗应用LLMs至关重要，领域适应能有效提升模型在专业医学领域的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

TL;DR: KG-CQR是一个新颖的知识图谱增强检索框架，通过提取和补全相关KG子图来丰富查询上下文，在RAG系统中显著提升了检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决语料库级别的上下文丢失问题，但缺乏对复杂查询的语义丰富表示。知识图谱与LLMs结合有潜力改善RAG系统的检索阶段

Method: 提出KG-CQR框架，包含子图提取、补全和上下文生成三个模块。通过语料中心知识图谱的结构化关系表示来增强查询的上下文表示，是一个模型无关的流水线

Result: 在RAGBench和MultiHop-RAG数据集上表现优异，mAP提升4-6%，Recall@25提升2-3%。在多跳问答等挑战性任务中检索效果持续优于现有基线

Conclusion: KG-CQR通过知识图谱的语义丰富表示有效提升了RAG系统的检索性能，具有模型无关性和可扩展性优势

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

Conclusion: 该工作填补了LLM评估的重要空白，为民航维修领域提供了标准化的评估工具，开源了评估基准和代码以促进进一步研究和发展。

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and

search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习和自然语言处理的多模态电子健康记录分析框架，用于预测ICU患者的死亡率和资源利用率，在三个临床任务上均优于现有方法，并对结构化数据损坏具有强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注结构化电子健康记录，忽略了自由文本笔记中的宝贵临床见解，且未充分利用结构化数据中的文本信息潜力。需要开发能够整合多模态EHR的深度学习框架来改善重症监护环境中的预测性能。

Method: 使用两个真实世界EHR数据集，开发并评估了基于自然语言处理技术的深度学习框架。进行了消融研究，评估医疗提示、自由文本和预训练句子编码器三个关键组件的作用，并测试模型对结构化EHR损坏的鲁棒性。

Result: 在三个临床任务上，模型性能显著提升：死亡率预测BACC/AUROC提高1.6%/0.8%，住院时间预测RMSE/MAE改善0.5%/2.2%，手术时长估计RMSE/MAE提升10.9%/11.0%。在不同损坏率下均表现出优于基线方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架是预测重症监护死亡率和资源利用率的有效准确深度学习方法，成功展示了使用提示学习和Transformer编码器分析多模态EHR的优势，对结构化数据损坏表现出强韧性，特别是在高损坏水平下。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

Motivation: 阴谋论侵蚀公众对科学和机构的信任，且随着AI生成错误信息的日益复杂化，需要理解阴谋论内容的修辞模式来开发干预措施和评估AI漏洞。

Method: 创建ConspirED数据集，使用CONSPIR认知框架标注在线阴谋论文章的多句摘录，开发计算模型识别阴谋论特征，并评估大型语言模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ConspirED数据集为识别阴谋论认知特征提供了重要工具，同时揭示了当前AI模型在应对阴谋论内容时的脆弱性，需要进一步改进模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model

TL;DR: FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准测试存在质量问题，翻译质量未达声称的90%标准，存在文化偏见和领域特异性问题，简单启发式方法就能获得不错的BLEU分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估FLORES+基准测试在多语言机器翻译评估中的适用性，发现其在翻译质量、文化中立性和领域通用性方面存在严重缺陷。

Method: 通过人工评估四种语言（Asante Twi、日语、Jinghpaw和南阿塞拜疆语）的翻译质量，分析源句子的领域特异性和文化偏见，并测试简单启发式方法在基准测试中的表现。

Result: 发现许多翻译质量低于声称的90%标准，源句子过于领域特定且偏向英语世界文化，简单命名实体复制就能获得不错的BLEU分数，高质量MT模型在FLORES+上表现不佳但在领域相关评估集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 需要构建使用领域通用、文化中立源文本且较少依赖命名实体的多语言MT基准测试，以更好地反映真实世界的翻译挑战。

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

TL;DR: SciTopic是一种基于大语言模型增强的科学文献主题发现方法，通过构建文本编码器、空间优化模块和LLM指导的对比学习，显著提升了科学主题识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题发现方法主要依赖词嵌入技术，缺乏对科学文献的全面理解，难以处理复杂的高维文本关系。大语言模型在文本理解方面的卓越能力为解决这一问题提供了新的思路。

Method: 1) 构建文本编码器捕获科学文献内容（元数据、标题、摘要）；2) 构建空间优化模块，整合基于熵的采样和LLM指导的三元组任务；3) 基于LLM指导微调文本编码器，通过优化三元组对比损失使编码器更好区分不同主题的实例。

Result: 在三个真实世界科学文献数据集上的广泛实验表明，SciTopic在科学主题发现方面优于最先进的方法，使研究人员能够获得更深入、更快速的洞察。

Conclusion: SciTopic通过利用大语言模型的文本理解能力，有效解决了传统主题发现方法的局限性，为科学文献主题分析提供了更强大的工具，有助于研究人员识别新兴趋势和探索新的研究方向。

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦蒸馏研究主要关注标签多样性，忽略了语言领域（输入）多样性这一NLP中的关键因素，需要更真实的非IID场景评估

Method: 提出自适应联邦蒸馏框架(AdaFD)，包含多领域非IID场景的统一基准测试框架，支持同构和异构设置

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能够捕捉本地客户端的多样性，相比现有工作获得更好的性能

Conclusion: AdaFD框架有效解决了多领域非IID挑战，为真实环境中的联邦学习提供了更好的评估基准和解决方案

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Motivation: 传统抽取式摘要模型存在多阶段流水线导致信息累积损失和架构瓶颈，以及对用户查询和文档语义理解不足的问题，特别是在处理复杂搜索意图时表现不佳。

Method: 整合大模型蒸馏、监督微调、直接偏好优化和前瞻解码技术，将仅0.1B参数的轻量级模型转化为领域专业化的QDTS专家模型。

Result: 在多个行业相关指标上超越生产基线并达到新的最先进水平，部署效率优异，仅需334个NVIDIA L20 GPU即可在55ms平均延迟下处理约50,000查询/秒。

Conclusion: 该生成模型框架成功解决了传统抽取式摘要的局限性，为工业级实时查询驱动文本摘要提供了高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答面临数据稀疏性挑战，导致语言模型容易学习虚假模式。现有方法主要关注问题生成的多样化，但忽视了关键知识的整合，如文档中的相关句子。

Method: 提出知识组合采样(KCS)框架，将知识组合选择建模为句子级条件预测任务，使用概率对比损失预测下一个最相关的知识片段，在推理时采用随机解码策略平衡准确性和多样性。

Result: KCS在知识组合选择准确率上比基线方法提升3.9%，在HotpotQA和2WikiMultihopQA数据集上的数据增强应用也取得了性能改进。

Conclusion: KCS框架通过有效整合相关知识并增强问题多样性，成功解决了多跳问答中的数据稀疏性问题，为相关任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

TL;DR: 当前图语言模型(GLM)的评估基准存在缺陷，仅使用单模态信息就能获得良好表现，无法真正评估多模态推理能力。作者提出了CLEGR基准来评估结构和文本语义的联合推理，发现现有GLM在结构推理任务上表现不佳，且与仅使用软提示的LLM基线性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GLM评估基准主要基于重用的节点分类数据集，无法充分评估多模态推理能力，因为这些基准使用单模态信息就能获得强性能表现，不需要真正的图-语言整合。

Method: 引入CLEGR(组合式语言-图推理)基准，采用合成图生成流水线配合需要结构和文本语义联合推理的问题，对代表性GLM架构进行全面评估。

Result: 软提示的LLM基线性能与包含完整GNN骨干的GLM相当；GLM在需要结构推理的任务上表现出显著性能下降；当前GLM的图推理能力存在局限。

Conclusion: 研究结果质疑了将图结构整合到LLM中的架构必要性，揭示了当前GLM在图推理能力方面的局限性，为推进涉及图结构和语言的显式多模态推理提供了基础。

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

Motivation: 当错误识别的单词与真实实体形式差异较大时，现有的基于语音编辑距离的NEC方法无法有效定位错误词汇

Method: 利用语音声音特征检索候选实体，设计生成式方法标注并替换ASR识别结果中的实体错误

Result: 在开源咊自建测试集上验证，该NEC方法能够显著提高实体准确性

Conclusion: 该方法在词形差异较大的场景下仍有效，将开源自建测试集咊训练数据

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA

Method: 提出了两种针对性解决方案：1) 针对隐写的分步验证方法；2) 针对水印的后处理回滚方法。

Result: 实验表明：隐写方面，相比传统消歧方法，直接处理分词不一致性可提升流畅性、不可感知性和抗隐写分析能力；水印方面，处理分词不一致性可增强可检测性和抗攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过识别和处理分词不一致性问题，能够有效提升文本隐写和水印技术的性能表现，为解决大语言模型时代的文本安全挑战提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

Motivation: 当前长链思维(CoT)方法存在局限性，需要开发能够自主探索、验证和优化复杂问题解决中间步骤的智能体模型，同时降低训练成本。

Method: 采用三项关键创新：高效RL基础设施支持高吞吐量Python代码执行；GRPO-RoC算法处理编码工具环境噪声；从非推理SFT到多阶段RL的高效训练配方。

Result: 在仅510个RL步骤和一周训练时间内，将预训练14B模型提升至SOTA水平，在数学推理任务上表现优异，同时在对齐、科学推理和工具使用任务上展现强泛化能力。

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent证明了小参数模型通过智能体强化学习可以实现前沿性能，为高效智能体训练提供了可行方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本地差分隐私文本处理方法在低ε值下效果不佳，需要高ε值才能获得合理结果，这限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出DP-ST方法，使用语义三元组进行邻域感知的私有文档生成，采用分治策略，并结合LLM进行后处理以提高文本连贯性。

Result: 该方法在较低ε值下仍能生成连贯文本，有效平衡了隐私保护和数据效用。

Conclusion: 通过限制隐私邻域概念和利用分治策略，结合LLM后处理，可以在合理ε水平下实现隐私与效用的平衡，文本连贯性对此至关重要。

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

Result: 在多个IHS数据集上，F1-macro分数在数据集内评估提升最高1.10个百分点，跨数据集评估提升最高20.35个百分点

Conclusion: 微调通用LLM嵌入模型是检测隐式仇恨言论的有效方法，无需复杂的外部知识或额外信息，就能实现最先进的性能

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

TL;DR: GUARD是一种自适应的解码方法，通过全局和局部不确定性信号平衡文本生成的连贯性和多样性，同时提高生成速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放文本生成中连贯性与多样性平衡的挑战，现有对比搜索方法存在超参数依赖和计算成本高的问题

Method: 提出"Glocal"不确定性驱动框架，结合全局熵估计和局部熵偏差，集成长期和短期不确定性信号，并加入基于token计数的惩罚机制

Result: 实验表明GUARD在文本多样性和连贯性之间取得良好平衡，生成速度显著提升，人类和LLM评估者均验证其优异性能

Conclusion: GUARD通过创新的不确定性驱动框架有效解决了文本生成中的关键挑战，提供了理论保证并降低了计算成本

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过情感弧线分析比较了真实和LLM生成的认知行为疗法对话，发现合成对话在情感动态方面与真实会话存在显著差异，尤其缺乏情感变化性和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型生成的合成疗法对话被广泛用于精神健康NLP领域，但不确定这些合成对话是否能够抓住真实疗法中的微妙情感动态。

Method: 采用Utterance Emotion Dynamics框架分析价值(valence)、激活(arousal)和主导(dominance)维度上的细粒度情感轨迹，比较公开视频转录的真实CBT会话和CACTUS数据集中的合成对话。

Result: 合成对话流畅且结构一致，但在情感特性上与真实对话存在显著差异：真实会话呈现更高的情感变化性、更多情感汇集语言、以及更真实的反应和调节模式。情感弧线相似性低，尤其是客户端。

Conclusion: 当前LLM生成的疗法数据在情感保真性方面存在限制，强调了精神健康应用中情感保真性的重要性。研究人员提供了RealCBT数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

Method: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI)，对所有残差流写入矩阵应用秩一权重修改，从小型有害/无害指令对计算所需的安全方向

Result: ROSI持续提高安全拒绝率（Llama Guard 3评估），同时在MMLU、HellaSwag、Arc等标准基准上保持模型效用，还能重新对齐'未审查'模型

Conclusion: 定向、可解释的权重引导是改善LLM安全性的廉价有效机制，可作为资源密集型微调范式的补充

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

Result: 在两个公开数据集TB-Dense和MATRES上实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了少数关系类的表现和整体学习能力

Conclusion: GDLLM框架通过有效捕捉全局特征，显著增强了事件时序关系提取的性能，特别是在少数类关系识别方面

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个可扩展的评测框架，用于构建多源检索和综合的RAG系统评测基准，解决现有评测在多源信息整合和长文本生成方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统评测多假设问题答案可从单个来源获得或者答案短小，而实际应用需要从多个分散源整合信息并生成长文本回答。

Method: 提出可扩展的评测框架，构建了两个新的多源检索和综合基准：MSRS-Story（故事综合）和MSRS-Meet（会议摘要），并使用各种RAG流水线进行实验。

Result: 实验结果显示生成质量很大程度依赖于检索效果，而检索效果又因任务而异。即使在理想检索条件下，多源综合仍具有挑战性，理解模型在综合步骤中显著超过标准LLM。

Conclusion: 该研究为多源信息整合的RAG系统提供了重要的评测框架，并证明了检索效果对生成质量的关键影响以及理解模型在综合任务中的优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次大规模评估了后训练量化技术在55种语言机器翻译任务上的表现，发现4位量化在高资源语言和大模型上效果良好，但2位量化对低资源语言造成显著性能下降，GGUF方法在低精度下表现最稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化技术对于在资源受限硬件上部署大语言模型至关重要，但其在多语言任务上的影响仍未得到充分探索。本文旨在系统性地评估后训练量化在机器翻译任务上的表现，以了解量化对不同语言类型的影响。

Method: 研究使用5个从1.7B到70B参数的大语言模型，在55种语言上进行机器翻译评测。比较四种量化技术（AWQ、BitsAndBytes、GGUF和AutoRound），分析了量化精度（4位和2位）、模型大小、语言资源级别以及语言类型学特征对翻译质量的影响。还研究了量化与解码超参数、校准语言之间的交互作用。

Result: 结果显示：4位量化能够在高资源语言和大型模型上保持良好的翻译质量，但2位量化会导致低资源语言和语言类型异质性高的语言的翻译质量显著下降。GGUF方法在各种量化精度下都表现最为稳定，甚至在2位精度下也能保持较好性能。语言匹配的校准主要在低位量化场景中才有显著好处。

Conclusion: 量化算法的选择与模型大小共同决定了多语言机器翻译的稳健性。研究结果为在量化约束条件下部署多语言大模型提供了可操作的见解，尤其是在低资源设置中，GGUF方法和语言匹配校准策略能够有效减少量化带来的性能损失。

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 语音到语音大语言模型是自然人机交互的基础，但评估这些模型仍然是一个根本性挑战。现有级联方法忽视了声学特征，且缺乏可解释性和语音偏好数据稀缺。

Method: 提出SageLM模型：1)联合评估语义和声学维度；2)利用基于原理的监督增强可解释性；3)引入SpeechFeedback合成偏好数据集，采用两阶段训练范式缓解数据稀缺问题。

Result: SageLM达到82.79%的人类评估一致性，分别比级联方法和SLM基线方法至少高出7.42%和26.20%。

Conclusion: SageLM为S2S大语言模型提供了全面、可解释的评估框架，在语义和声学维度上都表现出色，显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Result: IRMA在整体通过率上分别比ReAct、函数调用和自我反思方法高出16.1%、12.7%和19.1%

Conclusion: IRMA框架在动态环境中展现出比其他方法更优越的可靠性和一致性

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现有的ICL示例选择策略往往忽视结构化对齐，导致语义解析等结构化预测任务的性能不佳和泛化能力差。需要一种既能保持效率又能提升性能的示例选择方法。

Method: 两阶段策略：1）使用结构感知监督微调BERT检索器，选择语义相关且结构对齐的示例；2）添加模型无关的可插拔模块，增强隐藏表示中的语法信息，最小化开销并可无缝集成到现有流程中。

Result: 在涵盖三个语义解析任务的四个基准测试中，该方法始终优于现有基线，并与多个最新的LLM推理模型配合表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率、泛化性和性能之间实现了良好平衡，为结构化预测任务的上下文学习提供了有效的示例选择解决方案。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

Motivation: 现有后门防御方法存在局限性，要么只关注窄触发设置和检测机制，要么无法应对基于模型编辑、多触发器和无触发器等高级攻击场景，需要更全面的防御方案。

Method: LETHE采用内外双重机制：内部通过训练干净模型并与后门模型合并来稀释参数记忆中的恶意行为；外部通过在提示中添加良性相关证据来分散LLM对后门特征的注意力。

Result: 在5个广泛使用的LLM上进行分类和生成任务测试，LETHE在8种后门攻击中优于8个最先进的防御基线，将高级后门攻击成功率降低高达98%，同时保持模型效用。

Conclusion: LETHE被证明是一种成本效益高且对自适应后门攻击具有鲁棒性的有效防御方法，为LLM后门防御提供了全面解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

### [70] [Re-Representation in Sentential Relation Extraction with Sequence Routing Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21049)
*Ramazan Ali Bahrami,Ramin Yahyapour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用胶囊网络中的动态路由进行句子关系抽取，在多个数据集上取得SOTA性能，但发现在大型数据集Wikidata上表现不佳，主要原因是标签噪声和重表示能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子关系抽取是NLP中的重要任务，现有方法在大型远程监督数据集上表现不佳，需要探索更有效的表示学习方法。

Method: 采用胶囊网络的动态路由机制进行句子关系抽取，通过胶囊间的动态路由来捕捉语义关系。

Result: 在Tacred、Tacredrev、Retacred和Conll04数据集上超越现有最佳方法，但在Wikidata数据集上表现较差。发现标签噪声是性能下降的主要原因，同时证明了模型具有更好的重表示能力。

Conclusion: 除了标签噪声问题外，重表示能力是句子关系抽取中的一个重要挑战，胶囊网络的动态路由机制能够有效提升关系抽取性能。

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合大型语言模型和符号求解器的神经符号架构，用于自动化税务申报计算，在SARA数据集上表现出色，并能显著降低实际部署成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 税务申报需要复杂的规则推理和数值计算，传统方法容易出错且成本高昂，而纯语言模型缺乏所需的准确性和可审计性。

Method: 将LLM与符号求解器集成，先将明文规则转换为形式逻辑程序，再结合智能检索的案例表示范例进行税务计算。

Result: 该系统在SARA数据集上表现优异，能够将部署成本降至远低于现实世界平均水平，错误率大幅降低。

Conclusion: 神经符号架构为提供可靠、公平的税务援助服务展现了巨大潜力和经济可行性。

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

*Alberto Compagnoni,Davide Caffagni,Nicholas Moratelli,Lorenzo Baraldi,Marcella Cornia,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过CHAIR指标和DPO对齐训练，有效减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在处理视觉输入时常见的生成内容与图像不符的幻觉问题

Method: 利用CHAIR指标识别幻觉/非幻觉回答对，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)对MLLMs进行对齐微调

Result: 在多个幻觉测试集上显著减少了幻觉回答的数量

Conclusion: CHAIR-DPO方法通过简单的偏好数据构建和DPO训练，能够有效提升MLLMs的输出质量和可靠性

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

TL;DR: 基于Stable Diffusion 3的多模态框架，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜在空间，实现了无需涉及成本标注的高效准确图片伪造定位方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图片伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，成本高且难以跟上多模态大模型引发的图片编辑技术发展

Method: 利用SD3多模态处理能力，将高速筛波器提取的图片伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜在空间，保留输入图片的丰富语义信息

Result: 在广泛使用的案例数据集上达到了12%的性能提升，在未见过的真实文档伪造和自然场景图片上也表现出艰固性

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了依赖标注数据的限制，为应对新兴多模态图片编辑技术的伪造检测提供了有效方案

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

TL;DR: 本研究探索将多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）与定量属性相结合，以提高皮肤疾病AI诊断模型的可解释性，通过在SLICE-3D数据集上进行属性特定的图像检索案例研究来验证方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面已显示出显著成功，但模型预测的可解释性仍需大幅提升才能在实际临床中使用。MLLMs提供了通过自然语言交互提高可解释性的潜力，而定量属性（如病变面积）已被证明能高精度预测恶性病变。

Method: 通过微调MLLMs从图像预测定量属性值，使MLLM嵌入空间能够基于这些属性进行grounding。使用SLICE-3D数据集进行属性特定的基于内容的图像检索案例研究来评估这种grounding效果。

Result: 研究提供了证据表明MLLM嵌入空间可以通过微调来预测定量属性值，从而实现与这些属性的grounding。

Conclusion: 结合MLLMs和定量属性的方法为提高皮肤疾病AI诊断模型的可解释性提供了有前景的途径，通过将预测基于可解释的概念来增强临床实用性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

TL;DR: 提出基于Vision Transformer的统一框架，结合监督、自监督和重构目标，在低标签数据下实现自动调制识别的优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方法依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器的统一框架，通过重构分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，微调时使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签情况下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR下保持强性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

TL;DR: InfinityHuman是一个从粗到细的音频驱动人体动画框架，通过姿态引导的精炼器和手部特定奖励机制，解决了现有方法在生成高分辨率长视频时出现的身份漂移、颜色偏移和手部运动失真问题。


<details>

Motivation: 音频驱动的人体动画存在生成高分辨率长视频时的一致性外观和自然手部运动挑战，现有方法存在误差累积导致身份漂移、颜色偏移和场景不稳定，以及手部运动建模不佳的问题。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导的精炼器逐步精炼成高分辨率长视频。利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移，并引入基于高质量手部运动数据训练的手部特定奖励机制。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过稳定的姿态引导和手部奖励机制，有效解决了音频驱动动画中的长期一致性和手部运动真实性问题，为高质量长视频生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了SalViT360和SalViT360-AV两个新颖的360度视频显著性预测模型，并创建了YT360-EyeTracking数据集，通过整合空间音频线索显著提升了全景视频中的视觉注意力预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏全面的360度视听显著性预测数据集，且现有方法未能充分考虑球面畸变和空间音频整合的复杂性，本研究旨在探索如何利用视听线索有效预测360度视频中的视觉显著性。

Method: 提出了两个模型：SalViT360（基于视觉变换器的框架，配备球面几何感知的时空注意力层）和SalViT360-AV（进一步整合了基于音频输入的变换器适配器），并创建了包含81个ODV的YT360-EyeTracking数据集。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括YT360-EyeTracking）上的实验结果表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中观众注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于准确预测全景视频中的显著性至关重要，这为360度视频的显著性预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标（如准确率、IoU、mAP），而对可解释性关注不够。现有xAI方法多为样本级别解释，缺乏能够通过大量数据揭示模型整体行为的方法。理解模型在通用图像上的行为对防止偏见判断和识别模型趋势非常重要。

Method: 利用视觉-语言模型构建了一种管线方法，能够同时提供样本级别和数据集级别的解释。该方法可以在最小化人工努力的情况下分析视觉模型。

Conclusion: 该研究将视觉模型开发与xAI分析相结合，推动了图像分析领域的进步，为视觉模型提供了更全面的行为解释和洞察获取方法。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于MedNeXt-L-k5模型的自动化轮空间分割方法，在T2加权MRI数据集上达到了预期的分割精度，但在异质性T1加权数据集上性能有所下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割轮空间(PVS)耗时且中等评分者可靠性，而现有的自动化深度学习模型性能中等且稿性一般化能力不佳。

Method: 采用Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络MedNeXt-L-k5，训练两个模型：一个使用同质性T2加权MRI数据，另一个使用异质性T1加权MRI数据。通过5折交叉验证和留一站点交叉验证评估模型性能。

Result: 在T2加权数据集上达到了Dice分数0.88±0.06（白质），与手动分割可靠性相当；在T1加权数据集上Dice分数为0.58±0.09（白质）。在异质性数据集上的稿性化性能有所下降。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的轮空间自动分割方案，但活跃机制对于PVS分割任务并非必需，因为它没有超过nnU-Net的表现。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前的方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法持续传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互。

Method: 设计了一个训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应框架，包括注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适应剪枝和适应集成等关键模块，将输出预测作为更强的空间一致性先验反馈到中间注意力层。

Result: 该方法作为即插即用模块，无缝集成到四种最先进方法中，在八个基准测试中一致提升了性能，支持三种骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H）和多种注意力类型。

Conclusion: 通过利用模型输出作为空间一致性先验，有效增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，显著提升了CLIP在开放词汇分割任务中的表现。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在不同层处理视觉和文本输入的方式，揭示了模型的分阶段处理结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在各种视觉-语言任务上表现出色，但其内部处理机制仍未被充分探索，需要系统性的分析方法来理解其表示动态。

Method: 训练线性分类器从各层token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并通过三种提示变体（词汇变体、语义否定变体、输出格式变体）评估探针性能。

Result: 发现MLLMs存在一致的分阶段结构：早期层进行视觉基础，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。这种结构在不同视觉分词、指令调优数据和预训练语料下保持稳定，但具体层分配随基础LLM架构变化。

Conclusion: 研究为MLLMs的层级组织提供了统一视角，并提供了轻量级、模型无关的多模态表示动态分析方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假设CLIP等视觉-语言共嵌入网络的潜在嵌入空间可以通过分解为多个概念特定的子空间来解耦复杂场景的内容信息

Method: 使用监督字典学习方法估计线性合成模型，通过稀疏、非负的字典向量组合，其组级活动与多标签信息匹配。采用新颖的交替优化算法保证收敛

Result: SLiCS提供的解耦嵌入能够实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成，在TiTok和DINOv2等多种嵌入上都显示出改进的检索精度

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间方法成功解耦了视觉-语言嵌入空间，为概念级别的图像检索和生成任务提供了更精确的工具

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型在临床应用中存在严重的安全隐患，特别是受保护健康信息(PHI)泄露、数据泄漏和网络威胁风险，需要安全可靠的部署方案。

Method: 开发图形用户界面工具包MedFoundationHub，支持医生手动选择模型无需编程，工程师可快速部署开源模型，通过Docker编排实现隐私保护推理，仅需单块NVIDIA A6000 GPU的本地工作站。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的医疗VLM部署解决方案，但当前模型仍存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

Conclusion: BIM通过创新的扫描机制有效解决了多任务密集预测中的交互完整性与计算效率的平衡问题

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Motivation: 现有的文本导向编辑方法在复杂场景中存在限制，需要额外的非文本编辑提示来更好地描述编辑意图。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Motivation: 在大规模多标签数据集中，完全注释的成本高而不实际，因此需要研究从部分注释数据中学习。单正样本多标签学习(SPML)中每张图像只有一个正标签，传统方法将缺失标签视为负样本容易导致错误和假阴性结果，而各种伪标签策略又会引入噪声。

Result: 在四个标准数据集上进行了涉及范围广泛的实验，结果显示该框架显著提升了多标签分类的性能，达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 本文提出的AEVLP框架通过新的损失函数和动态伪标签技术，有效解决了单正样本多标签学习中的噪声挑战，为部分注释数据的多标签学习提供了一种高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、模糊边缘，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升对小结构和边缘区域的检测精度。

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图传播不确定性；提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征的注意力图；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制优化检测性能。

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理有效提升了显著目标检测的性能，特别是在细节保持和边缘清晰度方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Conclusion: 通过多尺度BEV特征生成和特征金字塔网络融合，MSMVD有效解决了多视角行人检测中的尺度变化问题，取得了显著的性能提升

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 通过整合两个模块，该方法产生了紧凑的特征表示，提供了高效的上下文建模并加速了编码过程，解决了LiDAR点云压缩中的稀疏性挑战。

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要大量角点案例进行训练验证，但真实世界收集成本高且危险。现有编辑方法存在视觉保真度有限或姿态控制不精确的问题。

Method: 利用编辑对象的3D高斯表示作为密集先验注入去噪过程，使用场景级3D边界框布局重建遮挡区域，并引入层次化细粒度特征指导外观细节生成。

Conclusion: G^2Editor提供了一个统一的框架，能够实现逼真且精确的物体编辑，为自动驾驶系统生成多样化的训练场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

TL;DR: 通过病理知识领域随机化策略，从健康数据生成合成数据来解决胎儿脑分割中CCD病例数据稀缺问题，实现了更准确的分割和生物标记物提取


<details>

Motivation: 胎儿脑精确分割对评估神经发育至关重要，但连合体发育不良(CCD)等稀有病变导致标注数据极其稀缺，限制了深度学习模型的沿桥能力

Method: 提出病理知识领域随机化策略，将CCD病变先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程，仅依靠健康数据模拟多样化的脑部改变

Result: 在248例健康、26例CCD和47例其他脑部病理的期前数据集上，方法在CCD案例上显著改善分割性能，连合体长度估计错误从10.9mm降至0.7mm，同时保持对其他病变的分割效果

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识集成到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提升对稀有但临床重要病变的分析能力

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Motivation: 传统语音识别系统对聋哑人士不可用，而现有的视觉替代方案（手语和唇读）通常被孤立研究，缺乏统一的集成框架来探索多模态协同效应。

Method: 设计了一个统一的模态无关架构，能够有效处理异构输入，特别探索了唇部运动作为非手动线索在手语理解中的作用。

Conclusion: 该统一框架成功整合了多种模态，证明了多模态协同的重要性，特别是唇部运动信息对手语理解的显著提升作用。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Method: 提出强化多轮推理框架，迭代选择视频片段并基于先前处理片段和当前问题的理解进行渐进推理，引入门控双级奖励系统（轨迹级奖励和轮级奖励）优化视频片段选择和问题理解。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和EgoSchema等基准测试中，Video-MTR在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法，推动了长视频理解的技术发展。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过多轮迭代推理和门控双级奖励系统，实现了更精细和上下文感知的视频分析，无需外部视觉语言模型，支持端到端训练，显著提升了长视频理解的性能。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Method: 提出双重不确定性优化（DUO）框架：1）通过凸优化视角引入焦点损失的凸结构，推导出无监督版本实现标签无关的不确定性加权；2）设计语义感知法向场约束，在语义清晰区域保持几何一致性；3）建立语义-几何互补的双分支机制。

Result: 在多个数据集和域偏移类型上的广泛实验表明，DUO优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUO通过联合优化语义和几何不确定性，有效提升了单目3D目标检测在真实世界域偏移下的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效整合2D和3D专家模型，成功提升了3D表面异常检测性能，具有工业部署的实用价值。

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit通过重新定义问题框架和引入交叉注意力机制，有效解决了现有图像编辑方法的局限性，在保持文本到图像模型生成能力的同时提供了更好的编辑效果和扩展性。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据的整体特征表示解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，保持子特征与整体特征的一致性，并设置自适应阈值计算置信度分数进行损失加权自监督学习。

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过双路径特征一致性和置信度感知学习，能够从多角度全面捕捉数据特征，有效减少伪标签噪声并缓解错误累积问题。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Motivation: 相机标定质量对新视角合成致关重要，1像素的标定误差就会对重建质量产生显著影响，而现有方法通过新视角质量来评估标定质量

Method: 提出使用3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)模型，通过将新视角颜色损失反向传播到相机参数上来进行相机标定细调

Result: 在3DGS参考数据集上，新的标定方法带来平均0.4 dB PSNR的提升

Conclusion: 虽然细调过程可能耗时较长，但对于像Mip-NeRF 360这样的参考场景标定，新视角质量的提升是最重要的

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有基于LiDAR的3D目标检测器需要大量人工标注标签，而获取高质量3D标签耗时耗力。现有无监督方法简单整合点云和图像生成的伪框，忽略了两种模态的互补性，改进有限。

Method: 提出数据级早期融合框架：1）使用视觉基础模型进行图像实例分割和深度估计；2）双向融合方法：真实点从2D空间获取类别标签，2D像素投影到3D增强点密度；3）局部和全局过滤方法抑制噪声；4）基于数据级融合的动态自进化策略迭代优化伪框。

Conclusion: 通过数据级早期融合和双向信息传递，有效利用了LiDAR和RGB图像的互补优势，结合过滤策略和动态优化，显著提升了无监督3D目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BMI测量方法在远程医疗或紧急情况下不可行或不切实际，需要从相机图像中快速评估体重指数。现有计算机视觉方法受限于较小数据集（最多14,500张图像）。

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

TL;DR: 本研究通过557个模拟实验，系统评估了7种主流域适应技术在自然和医学图像分类中的表现，发现DSAN算法在COVID-19等医学数据集上表现优异，准确率达91.2%，在动态数据流场景中相比基线提升6.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 域适应技术能缓解训练集和测试集之间的分布差异，但现有研究多基于自然图像而非医学数据，且主流数据集可能导致性能偏差。本研究旨在深入理解域适应技术对自然和医学图像的实际效益。

Method: 使用7种广泛应用的域适应技术，在5个自然图像数据集和8个医学图像数据集上进行557个模拟实验，涵盖分布外、动态数据流和有限训练样本等多种场景。

Result: DSAN算法表现突出，在COVID-19数据集上使用Resnet50达到91.2%的分类准确率，在动态数据流场景中相比基线提升6.7%。DSAN在COVID-19和皮肤癌数据集上展现出显著的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对域适应技术的理解，为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

TL;DR: 提出CLAB方法，通过对比学习辅助分支和动态损失权重策略，在不增加推理计算成本的情况下提升视频目标检测性能，在ImageNet VID数据集上达到SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡等图像退化问题，现有方法通过特征聚合和后处理技术提升性能但计算成本高，需要在不增加推理负担的情况下提高鲁棒性

Method: 1) 使用对比损失实现对比学习辅助分支，增强主干网络特征表示能力；2) 提出动态损失权重策略，训练早期侧重辅助特征学习，后期逐渐侧重检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现了CNN模型的最先进性能，无需额外后处理方法

Conclusion: CLAB方法通过简单的对比学习辅助分支和动态权重策略，有效提升了视频目标检测的鲁棒性和性能，且不增加推理时的计算负担

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为，发现特定注意力头负责提取排版信息，并提出无需微调的选择性消融防御方法，显著提升抗攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和模型越狱，需要有效的防御机制。

Method: 定位CLIP模型中负责提取排版信息的专用注意力头，通过选择性消融这些注意力头组成的排版电路来防御攻击，无需微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降不到1%，与需要微调的最先进方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列抗排版攻击的dyslexic CLIP模型，可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的可缓存扩散架构成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和性能问题，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了新的解决方案和数据集支持。

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UTA-Sign是一种无监督的热成像-事件视频增强方法，用于低光照环境下的交通标志识别，通过双提升机制融合热成像帧和事件信号来克服单一模态的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像相机在低光照条件下表现优异，但在识别相似材料制成的标志时存在盲点；事件相机能有效检测光强变化但采样不均匀。两种模态具有互补特性，需要融合来解决自动驾驶系统中的语义理解安全问题。

Result: 在真实场景数据集上验证，在交通标志描绘方面表现出优越的质量，在感知层面提高了检测准确性。

Conclusion: UTA-Sign成功融合了热成像和事件相机的互补优势，有效解决了低光照环境下交通标志识别的挑战，为自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠的环境感知能力。

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的GAN-PFO框架能够有效解决分开连续推理中的数据泄漏风险，为深度学习系统的隐私安全提供了重要的安全分析工具

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

TL;DR: MobileCLIP2通过改进多模态强化训练方法，包括更好的CLIP教师集成和优化的标题生成器，在保持低延迟的同时显著提升了零样本准确率，成为移动端最先进的图像-文本模型。


<details>

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarBack是一个用于3D高斯头像重建的即插即用框架，通过生成身份一致的后视图伪图像和自适应空间对齐策略，解决了现有方法因依赖前视图图像而导致后头部重建质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的头像重建方法主要依赖前视图图像，导致后头部区域重建质量差，存在几何不一致、结构模糊和真实感降低等问题，限制了重建头像的保真度。

Method: 提出AvatarBack框架，包含两个核心技术：1）主体特定生成器（SSG）利用生成先验从稀疏前视图输入合成身份一致的后视图伪图像；2）自适应空间对齐策略（ASA）使用可学习变换矩阵优化训练过程中的几何对齐，解决姿态和坐标差异。

Result: 在NeRSemble和K-hairstyle数据集上的实验表明，AvatarBack显著提升了后头部重建质量，同时保持了前视图保真度，重建的头像在不同运动下保持一致的视觉真实感且完全可动画化。

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过显式建模缺失的后头部区域，成功解决了3D高斯头像重建中的后视图质量问题，为构建完整一致的头像提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模态对齐方法依赖外部数据集、人工标注或复杂后处理，存在扩展性和成本问题，导致幻觉现象和安全风险。

Method: 提出生成偏见自我判断分数（debiased self-judgment score）的新方法，让模型在不依赖外部资源的情况下自主进行自我评估和改进对齐效果。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在减少幻觉现象、提升安全性和改善整体能力方面显著超过传统方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为大型视觉-语言模型的对齐提供了更有效的解决方案，通过自主自我评估实现了更好的多模态整合效果。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了C3-GS实现了最先进的渲染质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现照片级真实感合成，无需额外监督，代码已开源。

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在抽象涂鸦风格转换中面部特征容易失真导致身份识别性丧失的问题，保持个人和文化真实性。

Method: 采用"风格优先、身份后处理"范式：首先通过LoRA微调预训练扩散变换器进行风格迁移，然后使用面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入，无需关键点即可实现姿态定制。

Result: 定量结果显示具有竞争力的面部特征一致性，以及最先进的美学和人类偏好评分；定性分析和现场部署验证了系统的实际创意影响。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术目标，为创意AI应用中平衡风格自由度和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角图像和空间信息实现3D场景中的目标对象定位，无需场景特定训练，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有零样本3D视觉定位方法因依赖单视角定位而导致的空间推理受限、上下文遗漏和细节退化问题，推动3DVG向更大泛化性和实际应用性发展。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案并进行语义过滤，然后使用提案引导的多视角投影策略将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列中，最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定的对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM通过多视角真实场景图像和空间信息有效解决了零样本3D视觉定位的挑战，展示了优异的性能和改进，推动了该领域向实际应用的发展。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

Motivation: CLIP在军事防御应用中具有零样本分类优势，但其在遮挡和噪声等挑战性军事环境中的鲁棒性尚未充分探索

Method: 使用18类军事车辆自定义数据集，通过不同遮挡百分比评估CLIP变体的性能，采用归一化曲线下面积(NAUC)作为评估指标

Result: Transformer-based CLIP优于CNN；细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大；线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能急剧下降；微调后性能下降点延迟到60%遮挡

Conclusion: 需要在训练中加入遮挡特定增强，并进一步探索补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以实现CLIP在真实军事部署中的应用

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Motivation: 神经视频压缩(NVC)虽然性能显著，但学习型编解码器存在固有的比特率控制限制，需要解决可变比特率场景下的精确控制问题

Method: 提出动态路由自编码器(DRA)和速率控制代理，DRA包含多条编码路径，每条路径占用部分计算复杂度并对应不同的RD权衡；速率控制代理实时估计每条路径的比特率并调整编码路径；采用联合路径优化策略进行协同训练

Conclusion: 该方法实现了速率-失真-复杂度优化(RDCO)，适用于各种比特率和比特率受限的应用场景

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet通过形状引导的贝叶斯深度学习框架，成功解决了传统强度相似性损失的局限性，为心脏功能评估提供了更准确可靠的运动估计方法。

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Conclusion: 该方法推理时间开销可忽略，仅需粗粒度域元数据，提供强大且平衡的性能，是MIDOG 2025挑战的有竞争力方案

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Motivation: 虽然皮肤病变分类模型的准确性已经超过皮肤科医生，但医疗实践中对AI模型的不信任仍是挑战。现有可解释性方法存在可靠性问题，需要更可信、可解释的诊断方法。

Method: 提出全局类激活概率地图评估方法，在像素级别概率性分析所有类别的激活地图，并统一可视化诊断过程。同时集成SafeML来检测错误诊断并发出警告。

Result: 方法在ISIC数据集上使用MobileNetV2和Vision Transformers进行了评估，显示能够有效减少误诊风险。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提供更可靠的可解释性和错误诊断检测，显著提升了皮肤病变分类的诊断可靠性和病人安全性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

Motivation: 当前基于点式奖励模型的T2I生成方法容易受到奖励黑客攻击，微小分数差异在归一化后被放大，导致模型过度优化琐碎增益，破坏生成稳定性

Method: Pref-GRPO采用成对偏好奖励方法，在每组图像中使用偏好RM进行成对比较，以胜率作为奖励信号，将优化目标从分数最大化转变为偏好拟合

Result: 实验表明Pref-GRPO能区分细微的图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势并缓解奖励黑客问题。UniGenBench基准包含600个提示，覆盖5个主题20个子主题，通过10个主要标准和27个子标准评估语义一致性

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO方法有效解决了奖励黑客问题，UniGenBench为T2I模型提供了全面的评估框架，揭示了开源和闭源模型的优缺点

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

*Beth Pearson,Bilal Boulbarss,Michael Wray,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了Diffusion Classifier、CLIP和ViLT三种视觉语言模型在组合语义理解方面的表现，发现Diffusion Classifier和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系推理任务上都存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本特征是能够从已知部分组合形成新含义。虽然视觉语言模型(VLMs)近年来取得显著进展，但有证据表明它们无法有效执行这种组合推理，比如CLIP在处理红立方体和蓝圆柱体图像时容易出现错误标注。

Method: 评估三种模型（Diffusion Classifier、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习(ZSL)和广义零样本学习(GZSL)设置下绑定对象与属性和关系的能力。通过分析模型在概念绑定和关系推理任务上的表现来评估其组合泛化能力。

Result: Diffusion Classifier和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都面临显著挑战。对CLIP嵌入的分析表明，困难可能源于关系概念（如左右）的表征过于相似。

Conclusion: 虽然Diffusion Classifier在某些组合任务上表现优于判别式模型，但所有视觉语言模型在关系推理方面都存在根本性挑战，这突显了VLMs在处理组合语义时的局限性。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Conclusion: 提出的surfel-based SE(3)等变学习方法有效解决了点云配准中的方向和不确定性问题，在真实点云扫描上表现出色

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集有效模拟真实世界挑战，Veritas通过模式感知推理显著提升深度伪造检测的泛化能力和透明度

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Conclusion: DVCTNet通过双视图协同训练和动态特征融合，有效提高了牙科龋齿检测的准确性，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测主要针对完全合成的内容，但局部伪造（如修改面部表情、替换物体、背景修改）与真实元素无缝融合，更具欺骗性且缺乏专门的检测方法。

Method: 提出了FakeParts局部深度伪造技术，并构建了包含25K+视频的FakePartsBench数据集，提供像素级和帧级操作标注，用于全面评估检测方法。

Result: 用户研究表明，FakeParts使人类检测准确率相比传统深度伪造降低30%以上，最先进的检测模型也出现类似性能下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测方法在局部视频操作方面的严重漏洞，并为开发更鲁棒的检测方法提供了必要资源。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Conclusion: 该研究成功地将人群计数与图像融合集成到统一框架中，为密集场景下的多模态视觉任务提供了有效的解决方案，通过多任务协同学习和对抗训练显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate

TL;DR: PathMR是一个细胞级多模态视觉推理框架，用于病理图像分析，能够生成专家级诊断解释并预测细胞分布模式，在文本生成质量、分割精度和跨模态对齐方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在病理诊断中提高了效率，但模型决策不透明且缺乏可追溯性，限制了临床采用。需要提供透明可解释的AI辅助病理诊断。

Method: 提出PathMR框架，给定病理图像和文本查询，同时生成专家级诊断解释和预测细胞分布模式，采用多模态视觉推理架构。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，PathMR在文本生成质量、分割精度和跨模态对齐方面持续优于最先进的视觉推理方法。

Conclusion: PathMR具有提高AI驱动病理诊断可解释性的潜力，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will
be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）是致死率最高的癌症之一，五年生存率低于10%，主要原因是晚期检测。需要开发早期检测方法来提高生存率

Method: 分析了40个独特患者样本，评估了6种深度学习架构（包括传统CNN和现代Vision Transformer），采用改进的ResNet架构，使用冻结预训练层和类别加权训练来解决数据集小和类别不平衡问题

Result: 最终优化框架在癌症检测中实现了超过90%的准确率，显著优于当前手动分析方法

Conclusion: 建立了一个强大的自动化PDAC检测流程，可以增强病理学家的能力，并为扩展到其他癌症类型奠定了基础，同时为有限规模医学影像数据集的深度学习应用提供了宝贵见解

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一系列基于反事实推理的框架，用于解释、审计和减少视觉分类器和生成模型中的偏见。包括CAVLI、ASAC、TIBET、BiasConnect和InterMit等方法，通过系统性改变语义属性来探索偏见和建立更健壮的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实推理在可解释和公平AI中趋于核心地位，需要发展框架来解释、审计和减少视觉分类器和生成模型中的偏见问题。

Method: 使用反事实推理方法，通过系统性改变语义有意义属性来观察模型行为变化。CAVLI结合归因分析和概念分析，ASAC使用对抗性反事实，TIBET通过变化识别相关词语进行偏见评估，BiasConnect建立因果图，InterMit提供模块化减少算法。

Result: 这些方法能够揭示偏见相关性、探索因果依赖关系，并帮助构建更健壮的系统。ASAC能够提高模型的公平性和准确性，避免刻板印象。

Conclusion: 反事实推理作为一个统一的视角，可以在判别性和生成模型中实现可解释性、公平性和因果性，为社会责任偏见评估和减少提供了原则性、可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized

innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network
(CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the
model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了数据稀缺问题，显著提升了图像篡改定位在各种真实伪造基准测试中的性能

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的采样效率瓶颈，实现了高质量单步视频生成，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Motivation: 识别非典型有丝切裂图对评估肿瘤敏感性至关重要，但机器学习模型在域假移情况下性能伞然下降。

Method: 采用多任务学习方法，通过与主分类任务相关的辅助任务，帮助模型专注于分类对象而忽略图像背景的域变化。

Conclusion: 多任务学习方法能够有效应对域假移问题，提高模型在不同域数据上识别非典型有丝切裂图的稳健性。

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this
problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification
task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training
Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FW-GAN是一个基于频率感知的单样本手写体合成框架，通过Wave-MLP和频率引导鉴别器生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，解决了传统方法在长距离依赖和频率信息建模方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手写体合成方法主要基于传统卷积架构，难以建模长距离依赖和复杂笔画模式，且忽视了频率信息在捕捉精细风格和结构细节中的关键作用。

Method: 提出FW-GAN框架，包含相位感知Wave-MLP生成器来捕捉空间关系并保留风格线索，频率引导鉴别器利用高频成分增强真实性检测，以及新颖的频率分布损失函数对齐合成与真实手写体的频率特征。

Result: 在越南语和英语手写体数据集上的实验表明，FW-GAN能够生成高质量、风格一致的手写体，有效增强低资源手写识别系统的数据。

Conclusion: FW-GAN通过频率感知方法显著提升了手写体合成的真实性和风格一致性，为低资源手写识别任务提供了有价值的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMG-Vid是一个无需训练的视觉token剪枝框架，通过最大化边际增益在段级和token级去除冗余，显著减少75%视觉token同时保持99.5%性能，推理速度提升3.9倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型的视觉token过多导致计算负担重，现有方法忽视了视频的动态特性和时间依赖性，需要更高效的token剪枝方案。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1)基于帧相似性分割视频并动态分配token预算；2)使用时序引导的DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性来最大化token边际增益。

Result: 实验表明MMG-Vid能保持99.5%原始性能，减少75%视觉token，在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上预填充阶段加速3.9倍。

Conclusion: MMG-Vid通过最大化有限token预算的利用率，在保持强性能的同时显著提升视频大语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogVLA是一个认知对齐的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过指令驱动路由和稀疏化技术，在提高效率的同时提升性能，相比OpenVLA减少2.5倍训练成本和2.8倍推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。受人类多模态协调启发，需要更高效的框架。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing注入指令信息选择性地聚合压缩视觉token；2) LFP-Routing通过剪枝实现token级稀疏化；3) V-L-A耦合注意力机制确保压缩感知输入仍能支持准确动作生成。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实机器人任务中分别达到97.4%和70.0%的成功率，实现最先进性能，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐设计有效解决了VLA模型的计算效率问题，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了训练和推理成本，具有很好的可扩展性和部署潜力。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目跟踪器深度歧义和遮挡问题，以及多摄像头方法需要过多设备和复杂优化的限制

Method: 使用已知摄像机姿势和多视角深度信息，将多视角特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关性和transformer更新机制来预测3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB实际数据集上分别达到中位轨迹误差3.1cm和2.0cm，支持1-8个摄像头和24-150帧视频长度

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D跟踪研究设定了新标准，提供了实用的实际应用工具，具有良好的通用性和扩展性

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

Method: 使用单一视觉语言模型作为生成奖励模型，通过多任务强化学习直接在预训练基础模型上训练，无需任务特定的监督微调

Result: 实验结果表明，统一的编辑模型在多个评估维度上一致优于商业和开源竞争对手，如Ideogram、Adobe Photoshop和FLUX Fill [Pro]

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，为统一的多任务生成模型训练提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对NeurIPS 2024水印擦除挑战的获胜解决方案，包含黑盒和白盒两种攻击方法，实现了95.7%的水印去除率且几乎不影响图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试现有数字水印技术对抗对抗性攻击的鲁棒性，推动更强大水印方法的发展

Method: 白盒跟踪：使用自适应VAE规避攻击，在CIELAB空间进行测试时优化和颜色对比度恢复；黑盒跟踪：基于空间或频域伪影聚类图像，应用扩散模型配合受控噪声注入和ChatGPT生成的语义先验

Result: 实现了接近完美的水印去除效果（95.7%），对剩余图像质量影响可忽略不计

Conclusion: 该方法成功展示了现有水印技术的脆弱性，希望激发更鲁棒图像水印技术的发展

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

the blockchain industry has transitioned from forking to forkless chains due to
improved consensus protocols, forkless blockchains still rely on legacy forking
databases that are suboptimal for their purposes. In this paper, we propose a
forkless blockchain database, showing a 100x improvement in storage and a 10x
improvement in throughput compared to the geth-based Fantom Blockchain client.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在关系数据库中的集成日益普及，开源解决方案在功能性和性能方面存在显著缺陷，需要探索和改善现有的SQL调用LLM集成方案。

Method: 使用五个代表性查询对两个开源系统和一个企业平台进行评估，识别了结构化输出、资源利用和查询计划三个主要问题，并实现了初步解决方案。

Result: 通过实施初步解决方案，在支持LLM驱动的SQL查询方面取得了改善效果，证明了更紧密的LLM+DBMS集成的重要性。

Conclusion: 更紧密的LLM与数据库管理系统集成是实现可扩展和高效LLM查询处理的关键所在，本文的早期探索为进一步改进提供了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as
text summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated question-answering.
Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management
systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies
such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly
within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However,
open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor
performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source
systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to
expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked
LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs,
optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented
initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL
queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is
the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.

Conclusion: ReCoGNN框架成功实现了自动化特征增强，能够有效利用关系信号提升预测模型性能

Abstract: Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such
as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling
over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on
reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques.
This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be
automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?
  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature
augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features
extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN
first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table
attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured,
semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted
graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally,
ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate
information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the
original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing
methods on both classification and regression tasks.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SpeedMalloc使用轻量级支持核心处理多线程应用的内存分配任务，通过将分配器元数据隔离在专用核心缓存中，减少缓存冲突和跨核同步开销，相比现有软件和硬件分配器获得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内存分配虽然只占代码的小部分，但对程序性能有蝴蝶效应般的重要影响。现有基于加速器的内存分配器对多线程应用支持有限，且核间同步存在挑战

Method: 采用轻量级可编程支持核心处理内存分配任务，该核心具有高效的跨核数据同步能力，将所有分配器元数据存放在自己的缓存中，避免与用户数据产生缓存冲突

Result: 在多线程工作负载上，SpeedMalloc相比Jemalloc、TCMalloc、Mimalloc、Mallacc和Memento分别获得1.75倍、1.18倍、1.15倍、1.23倍和1.18倍的加速比

Conclusion: 使用通用核心而非专用加速器的设计使SpeedMalloc能够适配新的分配器设计，有效解决了多线程环境下的内存分配性能问题

Abstract: Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed
code, can have a "butterfly effect" on overall program performance, leading to
significant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately
5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x
performance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from
the complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core
systems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading
to cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.
Offloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a
potential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache
pollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for
multi-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators
remains a significant challenge.
  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory
allocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a
lightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data
synchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This
design minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for
cross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core
instead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting
new allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software
and hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and
Memento. SpeedMalloc achieves 1.75x, 1.18x, 1.15x, 1.23x, and 1.18x speedups on
multithreaded workloads over these five allocators, respectively.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在GPU内核性能优化中采用低效的搜索方法，缺乏人类性能工程师依赖的硬件感知能力。通过利用工作负载的内存访问模式、架构规格和性能分析日志，可以实现针对底层硬件的软件级优化。

Method: SwizzlePerf通过为LLMs提供明确的硬件感知能力，自动为分解架构上的GPU内核生成空间优化。系统利用工作负载的特定内存访问模式、架构规格、过滤的性能分析日志以及对历史性能的反思。

Result: 对于GEMM内核，SwizzlePerf在5分钟内生成与专家性能工程师花费2周时间找到的相同硬件特定最优swizzling模式。在10个不同的ML和科学内核测试套件中，成功为9个内核生成swizzling模式，实现最高2.06倍加速和70%的L2命中率提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作是系统化创建硬件感知LLM性能工程代理的第一步，展示了通过硬件感知方法可以显著提升GPU内核优化效率和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance
engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around
runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human
performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization --
hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access
patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections
on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are
tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates
spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving
LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.
  For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same
hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance
engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels,
SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve
up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the
first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM
performance engineering agents.

Method: 设计了一个线网无关的、支持VM部署的主机级控制器，结合动态MIG重配置、PCIe感知安置和轻量拦护技术（MPS配额、cgroup I/O），通过采样每个租户的尾部指标和系统信号来优化性能。

Result: 在单主机和2节点（16-GPU）集群上，SLO失败率减少32%，尾部p99延迟改善15%，仅付出小于5%的吞吐量代价；在LLM服务中也实现了类似的性能改善。

Conclusion: 该控制器能够有效减少PCIe线网干扰对延迟敏感垂载的影响，在保持高吞吐量的同时显著改善尾部延迟和SLO遵从率，具有良好的实际部署价值。

Abstract: Latency-sensitive inference on shared A100 clusters often suffers
noisy-neighbor interference on the PCIe fabric, inflating tail latency and SLO
violations. We present a fabric-agnostic, VM-deployable host-level controller
that combines dynamic Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) reconfiguration, PCIe-aware
placement, and lightweight guardrails (MPS quotas, cgroup I/O). It samples
per-tenant tails and system signals, uses topology hints to avoid PCIe hot
spots, and gates actions with dwell/cool-down to avoid thrash. On a single host
and a 2-node (16-GPU) cluster, SLO miss-rate is reduced by \(\approx\)32\%
(\(\approx\)1.5) and p99 latency improves \(\approx\)15\% with \(\leq\)5\%
throughput cost versus static MIG and naive placement; ablations show MIG and
placement contribute comparably. We also evaluate LLM serving with vLLM on OLMo
2 7B Instruct: TTFT p99 improves \(\approx\)10--15\% at \(\leq\)5\% cost
without changing the controller.

Conclusion: CoFormer系统成功解决了边缘设备上大型transformer模型部署的挑战，实现了高效、低能耗的协作推理，为边缘智能应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment
of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However,
ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant
challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource
requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload
transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models
on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either
considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy
and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative
inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central
idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of
transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple
smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are
aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem
to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous
hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the
optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively
calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the
capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge
devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer
models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6
billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%.
CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while
maintaining satisfactory inference performance.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了pdGRASS算法，通过并行化和密度感知机制解决了现有feGRASS方法在并行化和偏斜输入上的性能问题，实现了3.9-8.8倍的速度提升和更好的稀疏化质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图谱稀疏化方法feGRASS存在两个主要问题：1) 恢复步骤难以并行化，存在严格的数据依赖；2) 在偏斜输入上性能下降，需要多次遍历才能恢复足够边。

Method: 提出pdGRASS并行算法，将边组织成无数据依赖的互斥子任务，实现高效并行化，并在单次遍历中完成充分的边恢复。

Result: pdGRASS实现了3.9-8.8倍的平均加速比，稀疏化质量在PCG应用中表现出1.2倍更好到1.8倍更低的迭代次数，最坏情况下获得1000倍以上的加速。

Conclusion: pdGRASS在图谱稀疏化问题上显著提升了可扩展性和性能，解决了现有方法的并行化和性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Graph Spectral Sparsification (GSS) identifies an ultra-sparse subgraph, or
sparsifier, whose Laplacian matrix closely approximates the spectral properties
of the original graph, enabling substantial reductions in computational
complexity for computationally intensive problems in scientific computing. The
state-of-the-art method for efficient GSS is feGRASS, consisting of two steps:
1) spanning tree generation and 2) off-tree edge recovery. However, feGRASS
suffers from two main issues: 1) difficulties in parallelizing the recovery
step for strict data dependencies, and 2) performance degradation on skewed
inputs, often requiring multiple passes to recover sufficient edges. To address
these challenges, we propose parallel density-aware Graph Spectral
Sparsification (pdGRASS), a parallel algorithm that organizes edges into
disjoint subtasks without data dependencies between them, enabling efficient
parallelization and sufficient edge recovery in a single pass. We empirically
evaluate feGRASS and pdGRASS based on 1) off-tree edge-recovery runtime and 2)
sparsifier quality, measured by the iteration count required for convergence in
a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) application. The evaluation
demonstrates that, depending on the number of edges recovered, pdGRASS achieves
average speedups ranging from 3.9x to 8.8x. The resulting sparsifiers also show
between 1.2x higher and 1.8x lower PCG iteration counts, with further
improvements as more edges are recovered. Additionally, pdGRASS mitigates the
worst-case runtimes of feGRASS with over 1000x speedup. These results highlight
pdGRASS's significant improvements in scalability and performance for the graph
spectral sparsification problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模微服务架构中的治理难题，包括复杂的服务依赖关系、动态变化的拓扑结构以及不稳定的工作负载，这些因素使得传统治理方法难以有效应对。

Method: 将每个服务建模为智能体，使用图表示学习构建服务依赖图；基于马尔可夫决策过程学习策略；采用集中训练分散执行框架；设计博弈驱动的策略优化机制，通过选择-变异过程动态调整策略分布。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个关键指标上优于其他先进方法，显著提高了大规模微服务系统的治理效率和运行稳定性，表现出强大的实用价值和工程可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够快速响应突发工作负载激增、拓扑重构或资源冲突等场景，实现稳定的策略收敛，为大规模微服务系统治理提供了有效的智能优化解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent service optimization method based on a
multi-agent collaborative evolution mechanism to address governance challenges
in large-scale microservice architectures. These challenges include complex
service dependencies, dynamic topology structures, and fluctuating workloads.
The method models each service as an agent and introduces graph representation
learning to construct a service dependency graph. This enables agents to
perceive and embed structural changes within the system. Each agent learns its
policy based on a Markov Decision Process. A centralized training and
decentralized execution framework is used to integrate local autonomy with
global coordination. To enhance overall system performance and adaptability, a
game-driven policy optimization mechanism is designed. Through a
selection-mutation process, agent strategy distributions are dynamically
adjusted. This supports adaptive collaboration and behavioral evolution among
services. Under this mechanism, the system can quickly respond and achieve
stable policy convergence when facing scenarios such as sudden workload spikes,
topology reconfigurations, or resource conflicts. To evaluate the effectiveness
of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a representative
microservice simulation platform. Comparative analyses are performed against
several advanced approaches, focusing on coordination efficiency, adaptability,
and policy convergence performance. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms others in several key metrics. It significantly improves
governance efficiency and operational stability in large-scale microservice
systems. The method demonstrates strong practical value and engineering
feasibility.

TL;DR: 这篇论文是一个关于5G和6G系统中超高可靠低延迟通信(URLLC)的综述性研究，分析了如何在高可靠性(99.999%)和低延迟(1ms)这两个相互冲突的目标之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无线通信从以人为中心向以机器为中心转变，对速率、延迟和可靠性的要求发生了巨大变化，URLLC成为5G和6G系统的核心需求。

Method: 采用分层方法，详细讨论了物理层、MAC层以及跨层技术，包括各种5G及更高级垂直领域的设计考虑。

Result: 识别了为实现URLLC目标所展开的大量研究工作，追溯了无线通信中延迟和可靠性问题的历史演变。

Conclusion: 文章最后提供了详细的挑战分析和未来展望，尤其重点关注正在兴起的6G新范式。

Abstract: As the wireless communication paradigm is being transformed from human
centered communication services towards machine centered communication
services, the requirements of rate, latency and reliability for these services
have also been transformed drastically. Thus the concept of Ultra Reliable and
Low Latency Communication (URLLC) has emerged as a dominant theme for 5G and 6G
systems. Though the latency and reliability requirement varies from one use
case to another, URLLC services generally aim to achieve very high reliability
in the range of 99.999\% while ensuring the latency of up to 1 ms. These two
targets are however inherently opposed to one another. Significant amounts of
work have been carried out to meet these ambitious but conflicting targets. In
this article a comprehensive survey of the URLLC approaches in 5G systems are
analysed in detail. Effort has been made to trace the history and evolution of
latency and reliability issues in wireless communication. A layered approach is
taken where physical layer, Medium Access Control (MAC) layer as well as cross
layer techniques are discussed in detail. It also covers the design
consideration for various 5G and beyond verticals. Finally the article
concludes by providing a detailed discussion on challenges and future outlook
with particular focus on the emerging 6G paradigm.

Method: 集成MDPF模型和DRR算法，将路由器建模为学习代理，基于带宽、延迟和未满足兴趣数等指标智能预测最优转发决策，同时确保数据流间的公平带宽分配

Result: 在ndnSIM仿真中，DRR-MDPF在吞吐量、兴趣满足率、丢包率、内容检索时间和负载均衡等多个指标上显著优于SAF、RFA、SMDPF和LA-MDPF等先进策略

Conclusion: DRR-MDPF是智能、自适应且可扩展的NDN队列管理解决方案，有效解决了动态网络环境中的资源分配、拥塞控制和路由优化等核心挑战

Abstract: Named Data Networking (NDN) represents a transformative shift in network
architecture, prioritizing content names over host addresses to enhance data
dissemination. Efficient queue and resource management are critical to NDN
performance, especially under dynamic and high-traffic conditions. This paper
introduces DRR-MDPF, a novel hybrid strategy that integrates the Markov
Decision Process Forwarding (MDPF) model with the Deficit Round Robin (DRR)
algorithm. MDPF enables routers to intelligently predict optimal forwarding
decisions based on key metrics such as bandwidth, delay, and the number of
unsatisfied Interests, while DRR ensures fair and adaptive bandwidth allocation
among competing data flows. The proposed method models each router as a
learning agent capable of adjusting its strategies through continuous feedback
and probabilistic updates. Simulation results using ndnSIM demonstrate that
DRR-MDPF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art strategies including SAF,
RFA, SMDPF, and LA-MDPF across various metrics such as throughput, Interest
Satisfaction Rate (ISR), packet drop rate, content retrieval time, and load
balancing. Notably, DRR-MDPF maintains robustness under limited cache sizes and
heavy traffic, offering enhanced adaptability and lower computational
complexity due to its single-path routing design. Furthermore, its multi-metric
decision-making capability enables more accurate interface selection, leading
to optimized network performance. Overall, DRR-MDPF serves as an intelligent,
adaptive, and scalable queue management solution for NDN, effectively
addressing core challenges such as resource allocation, congestion control, and
route optimization in dynamic networking environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无线网络中，当源节点与目的节点之间的直接链路被阻塞时，需要通过多个候选中继转发数据包。每个中继存储数据包都会产生持有成本，因此需要设计有效的中继选择策略来最小化长期平均总成本。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了中继选择问题的Whittle-indexable特性，提出的Whittle指数策略能够有效优化无线网络中继系统的性能，为解决此类RMAB问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider a wireless network in which a source node needs to transmit a
large file to a destination node. The direct wireless link between the source
and the destination is assumed to be blocked. Multiple candidate relays are
available to forward packets from the source to the destination. A holding cost
is incurred for each packet stored at every relay in each time slot. The
objective is to design a policy for selecting a relay in each time slot to
which the source attempts to send a packet, so as to minimize the expected
long-run time-averaged total packet holding cost at the relays. This problem is
an instance of the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem, which is
provably hard to solve. We prove that this relay selection problem is
Whittle-indexable, and propose a method to compute the Whittle index of each
relay in every time slot. In each time slot, our relay selection policy
transmits a packet to the relay with the smallest Whittle index. Using
simulations, we show that the proposed policy outperforms the relay selection
policies proposed in prior work in terms of average cost, delay, as well as
throughput.

Conclusion: 该框架通过数字双生技术与深度强化学习的结合，有效解决了边缘-核心网络中VNF迁移的性能优化问题

Abstract: The growing demand for services and the rapid deployment of virtualized
network functions (VNFs) pose significant challenges for achieving low-latency
and energy-efficient orchestration in modern edge-core network infrastructures.
To address these challenges, this study proposes a Digital Twin (DT)-empowered
Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for intelligent VNF migration that
jointly minimizes average end-to-end (E2E) delay and energy consumption. By
formulating the VNF migration problem as a Markov Decision Process and
utilizing the Advantage Actor-Critic model, the proposed framework enables
adaptive and real-time migration decisions. A key innovation of the proposed
framework is the integration of a DT module composed of a multi-task
Variational Autoencoder and a multi-task Long Short-Term Memory network. This
combination collectively simulates environment dynamics and generates
high-quality synthetic experiences, significantly enhancing training efficiency
and accelerating policy convergence. Simulation results demonstrate substantial
performance gains, such as significant reductions in both average E2E delay and
energy consumption, thereby establishing new benchmarks for intelligent VNF
migration in edge-core networks.

Motivation: 无线接入网络(RAN)系统复杂且产生海量性能数据，传统方法难以有效检测性能异常，需要能够捕捉时间依赖关系的自适应方法。

Method: 提出RANGAN框架，集成生成对抗网络(GAN)和transformer架构，采用滑动窗口方法进行数据预处理以增强时间依赖关系捕捉能力。

Result: 在公开的Spotlight项目RAN性能数据集上评估，RANGAN实现了良好的检测准确率，特别是在识别网络竞争问题时F1分数达到83%。

Conclusion: RANGAN框架有效解决了RAN系统性能异常检测的挑战，证明了GAN与transformer结合在时间序列异常检测中的有效性。

Abstract: Radio Access Network (RAN) systems are inherently complex, requiring
continuous monitoring to prevent performance degradation and ensure optimal
user experience. The RAN leverages numerous key performance indicators (KPIs)
to evaluate system performance, generating vast amounts of data each second.
This immense data volume can make troubleshooting and accurate diagnosis of
performance anomalies more difficult. Furthermore, the highly dynamic nature of
RAN performance demands adaptive methodologies capable of capturing temporal
dependencies to detect anomalies reliably. In response to these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{RANGAN}, an anomaly detection framework that integrates a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a transformer architecture. To
enhance the capability of capturing temporal dependencies within the data,
RANGAN employs a sliding window approach during data preprocessing. We
rigorously evaluated RANGAN using the publicly available RAN performance
dataset from the Spotlight project \cite{sun-2024}. Experimental results
demonstrate that RANGAN achieves promising detection accuracy, notably
attaining an F1-score of up to $83\%$ in identifying network contention issues.

Motivation: 现代互联网应用具有异构QoS需求，LEO卫星星座需要联合优化路由、带宽分配和队列调度来保证服务质量，特别是在农村覆盖和城市补充场景中。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)启发方法解决NP难的联合路由带宽分配问题，结合Lyapunov优化的调度算法进行奖励评估，提出DSROQ算法。

Result: 在Starlink星座上的实验表明，DSROQ算法在用户体验和公平性指标上均优于基准方案，并揭示了从延迟敏感到带宽敏感业务时主导性能因素的转变。

Conclusion: 联合路由和带宽分配决策对LEO卫星网络QoS保障至关重要，DSROQ算法有效提升了网络性能，且性能主导因素随业务敏感性变化而转移。

Abstract: The modern Internet supports diverse applications with heterogeneous quality
of service (QoS) requirements. Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations
offer a promising solution to meet these needs, enhancing coverage in rural
areas and complementing terrestrial networks in urban regions. Ensuring QoS in
such networks requires joint optimization of routing, bandwidth allocation, and
dynamic queue scheduling, as traffic handling is critical for maintaining
service performance. This paper formulates a joint routing and bandwidth
allocation problem where QoS requirements are treated as soft constraints,
aiming to maximize user experience. An adaptive scheduling approach is
introduced to prioritize flow-specific QoS needs. We propose a Monte Carlo tree
search (MCTS)-inspired method to solve the NP-hard route and bandwidth
allocation problem, with Lyapunov optimization-based scheduling applied during
reward evaluation. Using the Starlink Phase 1 Version 2 constellation, we
compare end-user experience and fairness between our proposed DSROQ algorithm
and a benchmark scheme. Results show that DSROQ improves both performance
metrics and demonstrates the advantage of joint routing and bandwidth
decisions. Furthermore, we observe that the dominant performance factor shifts
from scheduling to routing and bandwidth allocation as traffic sensitivity
changes from latency-driven to bandwidth-driven.

Motivation: 尽管程序验证技术有所进展，但递归数据结构的全自动验证仍然是一个挑战，需要新的方法来高效推断程序不变量。

Method: 引入可解元组模式(STP)概念，开发STP推断算法，利用支持序列理论的SMT求解器验证推断的STP是否为归纳不变量，并将STP推断整合到支持列表式数据结构的CHC求解器中。

Conclusion: STP提供了一种高效推断递归数据结构程序不变量的新方法，仅需少量正样本且无需负样本，在自动化程序验证中表现出色。

Abstract: Despite the recent progress of automated program verification techniques,
fully automated verification of programs manipulating recursive data structures
remains a challenge. We introduce the notion of solvable tuple patterns (STPs)
to express invariants between list-like recursive data structures. A
distinguishing feature of STPs is that they can be efficiently inferred from
only a small number of positive samples; no negative samples are required. An
SMT solver that supports the sequence theory can be used to check that an
inferred STP is indeed an inductive invariant. After presenting basic
properties of STPs and an STP inference algorithm, we show how to incorporate
the STP inference into a CHC (Constrained Horn Clauses) solver supporting
list-like data structures, which serves as a uniform backend for automated
program verification tools. A CHC solver incorporating the STP inference has
won the ADT-LIN category of CHC-COMP 2025 by a big margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然任何贝叶斯网络都可以实现为概率程序，但反向表示（特别是包含用户标记样本语句和while循环的概率程序）的图形化表示仍是一个开放问题。这类特性在Gen、Turing和Pyro等概率编程语言中很常见。

Method: 通过扩展现有操作语义来支持语言特性，将程序转换为控制流图，定义静态分析来近似程序中随机变量的依赖结构，获得静态因子分解表示，并开发了基于程序切片的优化技术。

Result: 获得了无循环和常量标签程序的贝叶斯网络因子分解等价表示，以及定义无限随机变量程序的新图形表示。优化技术在变分推断中降低了梯度估计方差，在Metropolis Hastings和顺序蒙特卡洛中提高了速度。

Conclusion: 该工作为包含循环和动态标签的概率程序提供了首个图形化表示框架，证明了优化技术的正确性，并在实证研究中显示其性能达到或超过现有技术，为概率程序的静态分析和优化提供了新途径。

Abstract: It is commonly known that any Bayesian network can be implemented as a
probabilistic program, but the reverse direction is not so clear. In this work,
we address the open question to what extent a probabilistic program with
user-labelled sample statements and while loops - features found in languages
like Gen, Turing, and Pyro - can be represented graphically. To this end, we
extend existing operational semantics to support these language features. By
translating a program to its control-flow graph, we define a sound static
analysis that approximates the dependency structure of the random variables in
the program. As a result, we obtain a static factorisation of the implicitly
defined program density, which is equivalent to the known Bayesian network
factorisation for programs without loops and constant labels, but constitutes a
novel graphical representation for programs that define an unbounded number of
random variables via loops or dynamic labels. We further develop a sound
program slicing technique to leverage this structure to statically enable three
well-known optimisations for the considered program class: we reduce the
variance of gradient estimates in variational inference and we speed up both
single-site Metropolis Hastings and sequential Monte Carlo. These optimisations
are proven correct and empirically shown to match or outperform existing
techniques.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在生成实际微服务应用代码方面的进展，探索微服务基础应用程序的代码合成能力。

Method: 定义了规范微服务应用的标准模板，提出了判断规范难度级别的指标，并开发了自动化测试LLM生成代码的框架。

Result: 实验结果显示，像GPT-3o-mini这样的强大LLM在中等难度规范上表现不错，但在高难度规范上表现很差。错误分析揭示了LLM在代码生成中遇到的主要挑战。

Conclusion: 研究指出了LLM在生成实际问题代码时的限制，为改善代码合成能力提供了未来研究方向。

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate how far LLMs have advanced in generating code for
real-world problems. Specifically, we explore code synthesis for
microservice-based applications, a widely used architecture pattern. We define
a standard template for specifying these applications, and we propose a metric
for judging the difficulty level of a specification. The higher the score, the
more difficult it is to generate code for the specification. We develop a
framework to automate the process of testing LLM-synthesized code for a
microservice using unit tests. Our experimental results show that strong LLMs
(like GPT-3o-mini) do fairly well on medium difficulty specifications but do
very poorly on those of higher difficulty levels. This is due to more intricate
business logic, a greater use of external services, database integration and
inclusion of non-functional capabilities such as authentication. We analyzed
the errors in LLM-synthesized code and report on the key challenges LLMs face
in generating code for these specifications thereby suggesting future research
directions to improve code synthesis for real-world problems.

code generation, the generated code often exhibits poor runtime efficiency,
limiting its practical application in performance-sensitive scenarios. To
address this limitation, we propose an efficiency-oriented reinforcement
learning framework guided by a novel performance reward. Based on this
framework, we take a deeper dive into the code efficiency problem, identifying
then proposing methods to overcome key bottlenecks: (1) Dynamic exploration
overcomes the static data constraints of offline fine-tuning, enabling the
discovery of more efficient code implementations. (2) The error-insensitive
reinforcement learning method and high-contrast efficiency signals are crucial
for mitigating systematic errors and achieving effective optimization. (3)
Online exploration is most effective when starting from a high-correctness
baseline, as this allows for efficiency improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. With these discoveries, we finally propose a two-stage tuning method,
which achieves high and balanced performance across correctness and efficiency.
The results of experiments show the effectiveness of the method, which improves
code correctness by 10.18\% and runtime efficiency by 7.75\% on a 7B model,
achieving performance comparable to much larger model.

*Maolin Sun,Yibiao Yang,Yuming Zhou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Chimera是一个基于LLM的SMT求解器模糊测试框架，通过生成可重用的术语生成器而非直接生成公式，解决了现有方法中语法无效和计算开销大的问题，在Z3和cvc5中发现了43个已确认的bug。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMT求解器在现代系统和编程语言研究中至关重要，但其正确性测试面临挑战。现有测试技术难以跟上求解器快速演化的特性，而基于LLM的方法存在语法无效率高和计算开销大的问题。

Method: Chimera框架使用LLM：(1)从文档中自动提取SMT理论的上下文无关文法(CFG)，包括求解器特定扩展；(2)合成符合这些文法的可组合布尔术语生成器。在模糊测试时，用LLM合成的生成器产生的术语填充现有公式的结构骨架。

Result: 在Z3和cvc5两个主流SMT求解器上的实验表明，Chimera发现了43个已确认的bug，其中40个已被开发者修复。

Conclusion: Chimera通过转向术语生成器合成而非直接公式生成，有效确保了语法有效性并促进了语义多样性，同时只需一次性LLM交互投资，显著降低了运行时成本。

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems
and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like
symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the
critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas
are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed
well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly
evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show
promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain:
nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative
interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In
this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that
addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the
synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly,
Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for
SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2)
synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.
During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing
formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.
This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.
Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment,
dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT
solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43
confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.

TL;DR: RCLAgent是一个基于多智能体递归思维框架的自适应根因定位方法，通过模拟SRE专家的递归、多维扩展和跨模态推理特征，在微服务系统中实现高效准确的故障根因定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着微服务系统日益复杂，故障频发且根因定位困难。现有方法要么依赖预定义模式难以适应变化，要么缺乏可解释性。通过研究SRE专家的根因分析过程，发现其具有递归性、多维扩展和跨模态推理三大特征，从而设计新的定位方法。

Method: 提出RCLAgent方法，采用多智能体递归思维框架，通过新颖的递归思维策略指导LLM推理过程，整合多智能体数据和工具辅助分析来精确定位根因。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验评估表明，RCLAgent仅需单个请求就能定位根因，性能优于需要聚合多个请求的最先进方法。

Conclusion: RCLAgent通过模拟人类专家的推理特征，有效提升了复杂微服务环境中根因定位的效率和精度，为解决微服务系统可靠性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and
complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained,
interdependent subsystems-they are facing more frequent failures. Ensuring
system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces
and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing
methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to
evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning
process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this
paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of
failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different
organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis
exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion,
and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent,
an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that
leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a
novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process,
effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to
accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public
datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing
the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art
methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore
the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root
cause localization in complex microservice environments.

Motivation: 大语言模型应用从简单文本生成发展为复杂软件系统，其内在的非确定性、动态性和上下文依赖性给质量保障带来根本挑战。

Method: 将LLM应用解构为三层架构（系统壳层、提示组织层、LLM推理核心），分析传统测试方法在各层的适用性，对比软件工程和AI安全分析技术的差异。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM应用测试提供了系统性框架和实践指南，推动了测试标准化和工具化发展，AICL协议有助于代理间的测试集成。

Abstract: Applications of Large Language Models~(LLMs) have evolved from simple text
generators into complex software systems that integrate retrieval augmentation,
tool invocation, and multi-turn interactions. Their inherent non-determinism,
dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality
assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer
architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt
Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess
the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer:
directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at
the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference
core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software
engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community
reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics,
and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that
underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of
collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate},
and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance
framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring.
Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal
to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We
propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}}
(AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the
test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs能够从法律文本中生成高质量的Gherkin规范，显著减少人工工作量，为合规性需求工程提供有效自动化解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律文本采用技术中性语言编写，工程师手动创建合规性需求文档既费时又容易出错。生成式AI特别是LLMs为自动化这一过程提供了可能。

Method: 采用准实验设计，让10名参与者评估Claude和Llama从食品安全法规生成的60个Gherkin规范，每个规范由2人评估，共120次评估，从相关性、清晰度、完整性、单一性和时间节省五个标准进行评分。

Result: 相关性75%最高评分，20%次高；清晰度90%最高；完整性75%最高；单一性82%最高；时间节省68%最高。Llama在清晰度、完整性和时间节省方面略优，Claude在单一性方面更强。无最低评分。

Conclusion: LLMs能够从法律文本生成高质量的Gherkin规范，减少人工工作量，为实施、保证和测试生成提供有用的结构化工件。

Abstract: Context: Laws and regulations increasingly affect software design and quality
assurance, but legal texts are written in technology-neutral language. This
creates challenges for engineers who must develop compliance artifacts such as
requirements and acceptance criteria. Manual creation is labor-intensive,
error-prone, and requires domain expertise. Advances in Generative AI (GenAI),
especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a way to automate deriving such
artifacts.
  Objective: We present the first systematic human-subject study of LLMs'
ability to derive behavioral specifications from legal texts using a
quasi-experimental design. These specifications translate legal requirements
into a developer-friendly form.
  Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety
regulations by Claude and Llama. Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60
specifications were produced. Each participant assessed 12 across five
criteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings. Each
specification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments.
  Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest.
Clarity reached 90% highest. Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second.
Singularity: 82% highest, 12% second. Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second. No
lowest ratings occurred. Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences
across participants or models. Llama slightly outperformed Claude in Clarity,
Completeness, and Time Savings, while Claude was stronger in Singularity.
Feedback noted hallucinations and omissions but confirmed the utility of the
specifications.
  Conclusion: LLMs can generate high-quality Gherkin specifications from legal
texts, reducing manual effort and providing structured artifacts useful for
implementation, assurance, and test generation.

Conclusion: 可持续性架构视角为处理新兴质量属性提供了有前景的方法，独立于架构框架和行业背景，具有重要的实践价值。

Abstract: Sustainability is increasingly recognized as an emerging quality property in
software-intensive systems, yet architects lack structured guidance to address
it effectively throughout the software design phase. Architectural
perspectives-an architectural knowledge artifact composed of concerns,
activities, tactics, pitfalls, and checklists-offer a promising approach to
tackle such emerging quality properties across architectural views and are also
independent of architecture frameworks and industry contexts. In this paper, we
present a sustainability perspective vision, i.e., a revised notion of
architectural perspective meant to be filled with its own elements to target
sustainability concerns. We formulate our sustainability perspective vision
through evidence from applying snowballing to seminal literature and from
conducting a focus group with experts in the field. Our findings confirm the
relevance of the different perspective elements in practice and highlight
implications for shaping a sustainability perspective that meets industrial
needs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于断言的测试验证器，用于缓解计算机物理系统(CPS)模拟器执行成本高和结果不稳定的问题。通过遗传算法和决策树方法生成逻辑谓词，可以在不执行测试的情况下预测测试结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPS模拟器执行耗时且结果不稳定，需要可靠的自动化测试验证器来降低测试成本。理想的验证器应该可解释且能够对抗模拟器的不稳定性。

Method: 提出两种方法生成断言基础的测试验证器：1)使用遗传算法(GP)，采用Ochiai、Tarantula和Naish等故障定位公式作为适应度函数；2)使用决策树(DT)和决策规则(DR)方法。

Result: 通过航空航天、网络和自主驾驶领域的案例研究评估，发现使用GP加Ochiai公式生成的验证器准确性显著更高，而且在系统不稳定的情况下仍保持较高准确性，平均变化率仅为4%。

Conclusion: 基于GP加Ochiai公式的断言验证器方法能够生成高准确性、可解释且耐抗系统不稳定性的测试验证器，有效降低CPS测试成本。

Abstract: Simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is costly due to the
time-consuming execution of CPS simulators. In addition, CPS simulators may be
flaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test
re-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not
require system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs.
Ideally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human
understanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential
flakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test
oracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the
inputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test
oracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes,
fails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe
two methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic
programming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization
(SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness
functions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We
evaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains
of aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles
generated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those
obtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this
accuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system
under test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by
GP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in
their accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving
systems with flaky behaviours.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了并发bug检测和定位问题，在多个评估设置下均表现出优越性能

Abstract: Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in
multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus
compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning
methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and
dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack
sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary
classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as
precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for
effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a
dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation.
We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network
(GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that
concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further
facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method,
which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them
to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an
improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to
state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.

Conclusion: ConfLogger显著提升了配置可诊断性，加快了诊断速度1.25倍，提高了故障排除准确率251.4%，为配置相关问题提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Modern configurable systems offer customization via intricate configuration
spaces, yet such flexibility introduces pervasive configuration-related issues
such as misconfigurations and latent softwarebugs. Existing diagnosability
supports focus on post-failure analysis of software behavior to identify
configuration issues, but none of these approaches look into whether the
software clue sufficient failure information for diagnosis. To fill in the
blank, we propose the idea of configuration logging to enhance existing logging
practices at the source code level. We develop ConfLogger, the first tool that
unifies configuration-aware static taint analysis with LLM-based log generation
to enhance software configuration diagnosability. Specifically, our method 1)
identifies configuration-sensitive code segments by tracing
configuration-related data flow in the whole project, and 2) generates
diagnostic log statements by analyzing configuration code contexts. Evaluation
results on eight popular software systems demonstrate the effectiveness of
ConfLogger to enhance configuration diagnosability. Specifically,
ConfLogger-enhanced logs successfully aid a log-based misconfiguration
diagnosis tool to achieve 100% accuracy on error localization in 30 silent
misconfiguration scenarios, with 80% directly resolvable through explicit
configuration information exposed. In addition, ConfLogger achieves 74%
coverage of existing logging points, outperforming baseline LLM-based loggers
by 12% and 30%. It also gains 8.6% higher in precision, 79.3% higher in recall,
and 26.2% higher in F1 compared to the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of
variable logging while also augmenting diagnostic value. A controlled user
study on 22 cases further validated its utility, speeding up diagnostic time by
1.25x and improving troubleshooting accuracy by 251.4%.

Motivation: 针对面板AR(1)模型中当自回归参数rho=1时存在的识别问题，需要发展能够处理一阶未识别但二阶识别情况的估计方法和理论框架。

Method: 推广了Lancaster的修正最大似然估计(MMLE)，建立了当参数仅二阶识别时的GMM估计器渐近理论，并开发了基于修正轮廓对数似然的拟LM检验。

Result: 证明了广义MMLE估计器几乎必然存在且唯一，对|rho|≤1具有一致性；当rho=1时收敛速度为N^{1/4}；拟LM检验在均匀意义上具有正确的渐近尺寸。

Conclusion: 提出的广义MMLE方法和相关理论为处理面板AR(1)模型中rho=1时的识别问题提供了有效的解决方案，蒙特卡洛研究验证了有限样本性质。

Abstract: In this paper we consider two kinds of generalizations of Lancaster's (Review
of Economic Studies, 2002) Modified ML estimator (MMLE) for the panel AR(1)
model with fixed effects and arbitrary initial conditions and possibly
covariates when the time dimension, T, is fixed. When the autoregressive
parameter rho=1, the limiting modified profile log-likelihood function for this
model has a stationary point of inflection, and rho is first-order
underidentified but second-order identified. We show that the generalized MMLEs
exist w.p.a.1. and are uniquely defined w.p.1. and consistent for any value of
|rho| =< 1. When rho=1, the rate of convergence of the MMLEs is N^{1/4}, where
N is the cross-sectional dimension of the panel. We then develop an asymptotic
theory for GMM estimators when one of the parameters is only second-order
identified and use this to derive the limiting distributions of the MMLEs. They
are generally asymmetric when rho=1. We also show that Quasi LM tests that are
based on the modified profile log-likelihood and use its expected rather than
observed Hessian, with an additional modification for rho=1, and confidence
regions based on inverting these tests have correct asymptotic size in a
uniform sense when |rho| =< 1. Finally, we investigate the finite sample
properties of the MMLEs and the QLM test in a Monte Carlo study.

rather than the observed Hessian of the log-likelihood have correct asymptotic
size (in a uniform sense). We derive the power envelope of a Fixed Effects
version of such a LM test for hypotheses involving the autoregressive parameter
when the average information matrix is estimated by a centered OPG estimator
and the model is only second-order identified, and show that it coincides with
the maximal attainable power curve in the worst case setting. We also study the
empirical size and power properties of these (Quasi) LM tests and CSs.

Method: 在印尼北马鲁古省采用随机抽样500人，使用结构方程模型-偏最小二乘法(SEM-PLS)回归分析检验因果关系和调节效应。

Result: 变革型领导和工作投入对创新工作行为有直接影响，但组织公正既无直接影响也无调节作用。

Conclusion: 研究强调了领导力和工作投入在提升公务员创新行为中的重要性，为印尼地方政府组织提供了理论和实践贡献，并拓展了社会交换理论的应用。

Abstract: Regional civil servants in Indonesia, especially in the eastern regions, are
now required to exhibit innovative work behavior (IWB) as mandated by national
regulations. While transformational leadership (TFL) and work engagement (WE)
are believed to foster such behavior, the impact and the moderating role of
organizational justice (OJ) remain underexplored. This study addresses that gap
by examining how TFL and WE contribute to IWB development within the context of
public sector work, with OJ potentially moderating these relationships. This
study aimed to determine the direct influence of TFL, WE, and OJ on IWB and to
analyze the role of OJ as a moderating variable. This research was conducted in
the eastern region of Indonesia, especially North Maluku Province, in various
regional apparatus organizations. and a random sample of 500 people was taken.
This study used Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS)
regression analysis as a data analysis method to test the causal relationship
and moderation effects of each hypothesis. The study findings reveal that while
TFL and WE directly influence IWB, OJ neither has a direct effect nor serves as
a moderating variable. These findings offer theoretical and practical
contributions to local government organizations in Indonesia, emphasizing the
importance of leadership and engagement in enhancing innovative behavior at
work. This study extends and enhances the development of social exchange theory
based on civil servants' IWB. Furthermore, this study expands the theoretical
perspective by examining how TFL, WE, and OJ influence innovative work behavior
practices to improve employee innovative behaviour. Finally, this study
empirically examines the moderating impact of organizational justice on the
relationship between TFL and WE on IWB.

*Yongheng Hu*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文研究大数据如何通过稀释认知资源影响消费效用，提出消费调整权重函数，发现金融摩擦降低会增加企业平均财富但加剧不平等，有效消费权重在0.5时不平等最低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大数据环境下传统消费效用衡量方法的不足，特别是非理性消费无法转化为效用的问题，需要新的理论框架来解释大数据对经济主体认知和决策的影响

Method: 构建基于信息熵的消费调整权重函数(CAWF)，应用均值场博弈(MFG)理论建立企业财富分布模型，进行理论和实证分析

Result: 金融摩擦降低提高企业平均财富但加剧不平等；有效消费权重增加提升平均财富，财富不平等呈U型变化，权重为0.5时不平等最低

Conclusion: 提出以认知资源作为禀赋的新补充假说来完善'卢卡斯批判'，为大数据时代的消费效用理论提供新视角

Abstract: Big data has exponentially dilated consumption demand and speed, but can they
all convert to utility? We argue about the measures of consumption and utility
acquisition in CARR utility function under the condition of big data
interaction, we indicate its weakness, i.e., irrational consumption does not
lead to the acquisition of utility. We consider that big data, which is
different from macro and micro economic signals, formed by general information
entropy, affects agents' rational cognition, which makes a part of their
consumption ineffective. We preliminarily propose the theory that how dilution
mechanism driven by big data will affect agents' cognitive resources. Based on
theoretical and empirical analysis, we construct the Consumption Adjustment
Weight Function (CAWF) of agents interacting with big data and further apply it
to a model of firm wealth distribution with financial frictions, we get
analytical solutions according to the Mean Field Game (MFG) and find: Lower
financial friction increases the average wealth of firms but also leads to
greater wealth inequality. When agents convert effective consumption into
utility, which is a weight of total consumption, the average wealth of firms
increases with the weight increasing. Meanwhile, wealth inequality follows a
U-shaped trend, and it will be the lowest level when the weight approaches to
0.5. In conclusion, we try to provide a new complementary hypothesis to refine
the 'Lucas Critique' according to the cognitive resources as endowments
involved in the decision-making of agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估专利引用作为发明重要性代理指标的可靠性，区分技术价值、私人经济价值和社会价值等不同维度

Method: 系统回顾验证研究，包括专家评分、市场数据、续展记录和补偿报告等多种验证方法

Result: 引用数量与各种价值维度呈正相关，但作为指标存在较大噪声，相关性显著但远非确定性指标

Conclusion: 专利引用是有用的重要性代理指标，但需要谨慎使用，认识到其局限性并与其他指标结合使用

Abstract: This article reviews the empirical evidence on the use of patent citations as
a proxy for invention importance. It distinguishes between technical merit,
private economic value, and social value, and surveys validation studies using
expert ratings, market data, renewal records, and compensation reports. The
findings confirm that while the count of citations is positively associated
with various dimensions of value, it remains a noisy indicator -- correlated
but far from definitive.

*Benjamin Moll*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文认为异质主体宏观经济学中的理性预期假设不现实，应被替代。理性预期导致维度诅咒问题，使计算变得困难且不切实际，限制了该方法在金融危机等重大问题中的应用。作者提出了替代方案的三个标准，并讨论了多个有前景的研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理性预期假设要求决策者通过预测横截面分布来预测均衡价格，这导致了极端的维度诅咒问题，使得无限维度的贝尔曼方程计算困难，现实中代理人难以解决这类决策问题，限制了异质主体方法在宏观经济重大问题中的应用。

Method: 作者提出了替代理性预期假设的三个标准：(1)计算可处理性，(2)与经验证据的一致性，(3)对卢卡斯批判的一定免疫力。然后讨论了包括暂时均衡方法、纳入调查预期、最小二乘学习和强化学习等多个有前景的研究方向。

Result: 分析表明理性预期假设在异质主体宏观经济学中存在严重问题，导致计算不可行性和现实适用性限制。提出了替代方案的评价框架和具体研究方向。

Conclusion: 理性预期假设在异质主体宏观经济学中不现实且计算困难，需要被替代。提出的三个标准和多个研究方向为开发更现实的预期形成机制提供了有价值的框架。

Abstract: The thesis of this essay is that, in heterogeneous agent macroeconomics, the
assumption of rational expectations about equilibrium prices is unrealistic and
should be replaced. Rational expectations imply that decision makers forecast
equilibrium prices like interest rates by forecasting cross-sectional
distributions. This leads to an extreme version of the curse of dimensionality:
dynamic programming problems in which the entire distribution is a state
variable ("Master equation" a.k.a. "Monster equation"). Frontier computational
methods struggle with these infinite-dimensional Bellman equations, making it
implausible that real-world agents solve the associated decision problems.
These difficulties also limit the applicability of the heterogeneous-agent
approach to central questions in macroeconomics -- those involving aggregate
risk and non-linearities such as financial crises. This troublesome feature of
the rational expectations assumption poses a challenge: what should replace it?
I outline three criteria for alternative approaches: (1) computational
tractability, (2) consistency with empirical evidence, and (3) (some) immunity
to the Lucas critique. I then discuss several promising directions, including
temporary equilibrium approaches, incorporating survey expectations,
least-squares learning, and reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 哥伦比亚FARC单方面停火显著减少了强制内部流离失所事件


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FARC 2014年单方面永久停火对哥伦比亚强制内部流离失所(FID)的影响，哥伦比亚是世界上受FID影响最严重的国家之一

Method: 采用双重差分法，利用停火时间点和各市FARC存在的前冲突分布

Result: 受影响地区的严重流离失所事件大幅减少，效果逐渐显现并持续存在

Conclusion: 稳定性和和平协议的有效实施对于减轻FID及其深远后果至关重要

Abstract: Colombia's prolonged conflict has made the country one of the most affected
by forced internal displacement (FID) in the world. This study examines the
impact of the FARC's 2014 unilateral and permanent ceasefire on FID. We use a
difference-in-differences strategy that exploits the timing of the ceasefire
and the pre-conflict distribution of FARC presence across municipalities.
Results show a substantial reduction in severe displacement episodes in
affected areas, with effects that emerged gradually and persisted over time.
These findings highlight the importance of stability and the effective
implementation of peace agreements in mitigating FID and its far-reaching
consequences.

TL;DR: 通过揭示偏好方法提出了一种新的指数费铭模型表示方式，可以通过效率指标评估对该模型的偏离程度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的指数费铭模型在实证分析中存在偏离，需要一种无需作出参数偏好假设的方法来评估这种偏离

Method: 采用揭示偏好方法，不需要对效用函数做任何参数偏好假设，允许完全异质性

Result: 方法在柬架扫描仪的纵向数据中得到应用，并揭示了导致偏离指数费铭的各种源因

Conclusion: 该表示方法为评估费铭行为提供了一种灵活且强固的工具，能够在不作参数偏好假设的前提下评估效率偏离

Abstract: This paper derives a novel representation of the exponential discounting
model that allows one to assess departures from the model via a measure of
efficiency. The approach uses a revealed preference methodology that does not
make any parametric assumption on the utility function and allows for
unrestricted heterogeneity. The method is illustrated using longitudinal data
from checkout scanners and gives insights into sources of departure from
exponential discounting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将静态微观经济模型转换为动态模型的信号基础方法，通过经典鲁滨逊漂流记消费模型展示了从静态到动态的转换过程，并展示了拉格朗日和哈密顿力学表述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统经济学主要关注静态均衡，忽视了时间依赖现象（如路径依赖）的作用，限制了模型与实证观察的对比能力。

Method: 使用基于信号的动态建模方法，从经典静态模型出发，将效用函数作为消费力的生成器，构建动态模型，并用拉格朗日和哈密顿力学形式表达。

Result: 成功将静态鲁滨逊漂流记消费模型转换为动态模型，展示了动态建模的可行性，并提供了机械力学表述的替代解释框架。

Conclusion: 动态建模方法为经济学提供了新的科学迭代路径，相比静态方法能够提供更丰富的解释和与实证观察的更好对比。

Abstract: Economics has long been a science of static equilibria, in which time is a
second-order rather than first-order concern. Without time, economic modelers
may neglect or obscure the role of time-dependent phenomena, e.g.
path-dependency, and limit their ability to compare agnostically the model
results with empirical observations. In this article, I outline a dynamic,
signals-based recipe for building microeconomic models from traditional static
models. I demonstrate this recipe using a classic "desert island" Robinson
Crusoe (RC) model of consumption. Starting from a classic static derivation, I
then move to a dynamic view, using the utility function as a generator of force
on consumption. Finally, I show that the resulting dynamic model may be
expressed in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian terms. I conclude by suggesting a
recipe for scientific iteration using these alternate mechanical formulations,
and the alternative explanations these dynamic models may suggest compared to
employing a static approach to modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在信息验证成本存在的情况下，社会学习过程中虚假信息级联如何形成和崩溃，探索社会自我纠正的条件和机制

Method: 构建序列社会学习模型，代理人观察公共历史、接收私人信号、可选择付费验证主张（仅在主张真实时成功）、可披露或隐藏证据，分析二元和连续行动设置下的均衡

Result: 在二元行动基准中推导出调查临界点，证明其相对于经典级联带的位置决定级联可破性；连续行动中粗观察和从众性会重现级联，但偶尔的披露会使其崩溃

Conclusion: 提出了可处理的"韧性边界"概念，具有透明的比较静态和政策杠杆，为理解和管理社会学习过程中的信息级联提供了理论框架

Abstract: We study sequential social learning when agents can sometimes pay to verify a
claim and obtain hard, publicly checkable evidence. Each agent observes the
public history, receives a private signal, may investigate at a cost
(succeeding only when the claim is true), and can disclose or conceal any
proof. Actions are binary or continuous, with a conformity pull toward the
prevailing consensus. We characterize when false cascades persist and when
societies self-correct. In the binary benchmark, we derive an investigation
cutoff and show how its location relative to classic cascade bands governs
breakability; a simple knife-edge condition guarantees that any wrong cascade
at the boundary is overturned with positive probability. With continuous
actions, coarse observation and conformity can recreate cascades, yet
occasional disclosures collapse them. These forces yield a tractable
"resilience frontier" with transparent comparative statics and policy levers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在只有购买历史公开、买家有私人信号的情况下，长期卖家如何选择质量投资策略，以及这种信息结构如何影响市场效率和声誉动态。

Method: 使用马尔可夫选择框架，分析信念动态和卖家投资决策，考察信号精度、定价灵活性和结果披露等设计杠杆的影响。

Result: 发现信念会分裂为两个级联区域（行动无响应、投资为零）和一个内部投资区域；信号精度提高会扩大级联区域并可能减少投资；灵活定价可以消除级联，公开结果披露能扩大投资。

Conclusion: 信息结构设计对市场效率至关重要，灵活定价和更好的信息披露机制可以改善卖家投资激励和市场表现，为平台设计提供重要启示。

Abstract: We study a dynamic reputation model with a fixed posted price where only
purchases are public. A long-lived seller chooses costly quality; each buyer
observes the purchase history and a private signal. Under a Markov selection,
beliefs split into two cascades - where actions are unresponsive and investment
is zero - and an interior region where the seller invests. The policy is
inverse-U in reputation and produces two patterns: Early Resolution (rapid
absorption at the optimistic cascade) and Double Hump (two investment
episodes). Higher signal precision at fixed prices enlarges cascades and can
reduce investment. We compare welfare and analyze two design levers: flexible
pricing, which can keep actions informative and remove cascades for patient
sellers, and public outcome disclosure, which makes purchases more informative
and expands investment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究顾问在观察项目复杂性后设定通过阈值时，代理人如何根据阈值信息调整努力决策，比较天真制度（阈值无信息）和精明制度（阈值作为信号）下的均衡结果。

Method: 建立理论模型分析两种信息制度，刻画均衡阈值策略，给出分离、混同和半分离均衡的充分条件，在特定分布假设下提供显式参数区域划分。

Result: 最优阈值随复杂性增加而上升，在基准情况下明确了不同均衡类型的参数区域，标准精炼消除了大部分混同均衡，得到了透明的比较静态和福利比较结果。

Conclusion: 阈值作为信号在精明制度下影响代理人信念更新，均衡类型取决于模型参数，两种制度在福利方面存在显著差异。

Abstract: A benevolent advisor observes a project's complexity and posts a pass - fail
threshold before the agent chooses effort. The project succeeds only if ability
and effort together clear complexity. We compare two informational regimes. In
the naive regime, the threshold is treated as non-informative; in the
sophisticated regime, the threshold is a signal and the agent updates beliefs.
We characterize equilibrium threshold policies and show that the optimal
threshold rises with complexity under mild regularity. We then give
primitives-based sufficient conditions that guarantee separating, pooling, or
semi-separating outcomes. In a benchmark with uniform ability, exponential
complexity, and power costs, we provide explicit parameter regions that
partition the space by equilibrium type; a standard refinement eliminates most
pooling. The results yield transparent comparative statics and welfare
comparisons across regimes.

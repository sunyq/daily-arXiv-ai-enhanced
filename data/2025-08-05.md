### [1] [Exploring Agentic Artificial Intelligence Systems: Towards a Typological Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00844)
*Christopher Wissuchek,Patrick Zschech*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分类和比较自主AI系统的框架，通过八个维度定义其认知和环境代理能力，并采用多阶段方法构建和验证这一分类法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统逐渐发展为具有自主能力的代理，但缺乏统一的分类框架，因此需要一种结构化方法来分析和比较这些系统。

Method: 采用多阶段方法，构建并验证了一个基于八个维度的分类法，并通过人机混合方法进行评估和提炼。

Result: 提出了一个能够分析AI系统不同代理水平的框架，为评估当前系统和预测未来自主AI发展奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该分类法为研究者和从业者提供了一个结构化视角，有助于理解和推动自主AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into
autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human
intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking
to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of
agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive
and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase
methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then
evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into
constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to
analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured
perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a
foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments
in agentic AI.

### [2] [A Formal Framework for the Definition of 'State': Hierarchical Representation and Meta-Universe Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00853)
*Kei Itoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过引入数学上严谨且统一的‘状态’概念形式结构，强化了多样化系统的理论基础，包括智能的公理化定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决‘状态’概念长期以来缺乏共识和形式清晰性的问题，为智能定义、形式逻辑和科学理论提供数学基础。

Method: 提出‘分层状态网格’和‘中间元宇宙（IMU）’概念，扩展了跨数学、物理和语言领域的统一符号系统，并避免自引用和逻辑不一致。

Result: 建立了一个基于‘定义=状态’原则的元形式逻辑框架，适用于时间、语言、代理和操作，增强了表达能力和理论适用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为智能定义和跨领域理论提供了一个数学上稳健的元形式逻辑框架。

Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse
systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a
mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of
'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a
'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping
hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across
mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate
Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers
(ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level
operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on
this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory
beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration,
introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and
microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these
contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in
the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and
operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the
definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

### [3] [AgentTTS: Large Language Model Agent for Test-time Compute-optimal Scaling Strategy in Complex Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00890)
*Fali Wang,Hui Liu,Zhenwei Dai,Jingying Zeng,Zhiwei Zhang,Zongyu Wu,Chen Luo,Zhen Li,Xianfeng Tang,Qi He,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了多阶段复杂任务中的测试时计算最优缩放问题，提出了基于LLM代理的框架AgentTTS，显著提升了搜索效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单阶段任务中的测试时缩放，而现实问题多为多阶段复杂任务，需要为每个子任务选择合适的模型和预算分配。

Method: 通过大量实验得出三个经验性见解，并设计基于LLM代理的框架AgentTTS，通过迭代反馈自主搜索最优计算分配。

Result: 实验表明，AgentTTS在搜索效率和性能上显著优于传统方法和其他基于LLM的基线，且对训练集大小变化更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AgentTTS为解决多阶段任务中的计算最优分配问题提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However,
existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many
real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of
heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.
Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in
multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate
budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of
model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes
brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations
across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the
compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot
experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical
insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.
Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework
that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative
feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and
other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness
to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

### [4] [ff4ERA: A new Fuzzy Framework for Ethical Risk Assessment in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00899)
*Abeer Dyoub,Ivan Letteri,Francesca A. Lisi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模糊框架ff4ERA，用于定量评估和优先处理伦理风险，以支持AI与人类协作中的伦理决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着共生AI的发展，伦理风险增加，需要一种灵活、透明且稳健的伦理风险评估（ERA）框架来解决不确定性、模糊性和信息不完整的问题。

Method: ff4ERA结合模糊逻辑、模糊层次分析法（FAHP）和确定性因子（CF），通过伦理风险评分（ERS）量化风险。

Result: 案例研究表明，ff4ERA能生成上下文敏感且伦理意义明确的风险评分，且对无关输入具有稳健性。

Conclusion: ff4ERA提供了可解释、可追溯且风险感知的伦理评估，支持假设分析和设计校准。

Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical
decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI
systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.
Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that
minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and
incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.
This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for
ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and
prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select
actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce
ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic
Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks
via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the
FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a
robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,
step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields
context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert
input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant
factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis
shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global
Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and
certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results
demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware
ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in
calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical
decision support.

### [5] [An analysis of AI Decision under Risk: Prospect theory emerges in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00902)
*Kenneth Payne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文测试了大型语言模型（LLM）在风险决策中是否表现出与人类相似的‘前景理论’行为，发现其与人类行为一致，且情境（如军事与民用）对风险偏好的影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Kahneman和Tversky的‘前景理论’是否适用于大型语言模型，并探讨情境对模型风险决策的影响。

Method: 通过实验测试LLM在不同情境（如军事与民用）下的风险决策行为，分析其与‘前景理论’的契合度。

Result: LLM的风险决策行为与人类相似，受情境影响显著，军事场景的‘框架效应’更强。

Conclusion: 语言模型捕捉了人类的启发式与偏见，但偏见分布不均，情境（‘语言游戏’）是关键。研究还重新审视了LLM的推理与记忆之争。

Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive
way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated
experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk
of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of
Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,
including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how
these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also
demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk
appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded
within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I
find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do
civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that
language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also
that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple
gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the
contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my
findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in
LLMs.

### [6] [Knowledge Editing for Multi-Hop Question Answering Using Semantic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00914)
*Dominic Simon,Rickard Ewetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CHECK是一种基于语义分析的知识编辑器，用于解决多跳问答任务中的逻辑推理问题，通过优化逻辑和调整LLM温度提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在简单事实查询上有效，但在需要组合推理的多跳问答任务中表现不佳，导致逻辑错误。

Method: CHECK借鉴编译器与LLM推理的类比，先对推理链进行语义分析，修正逻辑错误，再执行推理链回答问题。

Result: 在四个数据集上，CHECK比五种最先进框架平均提升22.8%的多跳问答准确率。

Conclusion: CHECK通过语义分析和逻辑优化显著提升了多跳问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored
information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have
been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but
struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as
multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors
leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning
processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on
semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an
analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code
is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze
reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning
chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic
optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We
evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on
four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

### [7] [Idempotent Equilibrium Analysis of Hybrid Workflow Allocation: A Mathematical Schema for Future Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01323)
*Faruk Alpay,Bugra Kilictas,Taylan Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了AI系统如何重新分配人与机器之间的任务，证明了在广泛假设下存在稳定的均衡状态，并推导了自动化份额的闭式解。模拟显示自动化比例将从10%升至65%，剩余任务由人类主导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI系统快速发展如何改变人与机器的任务分工，并寻找稳定的均衡状态。

Method: 使用格论固定点工具（Tarski和Banach），证明均衡存在性，并通过连续模型和动态基准验证结果。

Result: 存在稳定的均衡状态，自动化份额为x^* = α/(α+β)，模拟显示自动化比例将从10%升至65%。

Conclusion: 人类将专注于监督和整合AI模块，政策应促进人机协作以实现福利最大化。

Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided
between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated
task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded
assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which
every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring
comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski
and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)
derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised
continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =
\alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and
$\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full
automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in
three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an
evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task
spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is
reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation
calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from
approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third
of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow
conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI
modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for
skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies
which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the
welfare-maximising fixed point.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

communication, and real-time scene reconstruction. The framework enables
efficient multi-agent 3D/4D scene synthesis through federated learning of
shared diffusion model and YOLOv12 lightweight semantic extraction and local
NeRF updates while maintaining privacy and scalability. The framework redesigns
generative diffusion models for joint scene reconstruction, and improves
cooperative scene understanding, while adding semantic-aware compression
protocols. The approach can be validated through simulations and potential
real-world deployment on drone testbeds, positioning it as a disruptive
advancement in multi-agent AI for autonomous systems.

*Amine Allouah,Omar Besbes,Josué D Figueroa,Yash Kanoria,Akshit Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了AI代理在电子商务中的行为，发现其对产品位置、价格、标签等有不同偏好，并展示了卖家如何通过调整描述来影响AI购买决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理在在线市场中扮演消费者角色，研究其购买行为和动机对理解未来电子商务生态至关重要。

Method: 开发了ACES沙盒环境，通过随机化产品参数（如位置、价格、标签等）来研究VLM代理的购买行为。

Result: AI代理对产品位置、标签和平台推荐有显著反应，但对价格和评价的敏感度因模型而异；卖家可通过优化描述影响AI购买决策。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI代理在电子商务中的行为模式，提出了卖家策略、平台设计和监管方面的新问题。

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on
behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking,
vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and
transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?
We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent
with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first
conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by
randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and
platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually
shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top
row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption
of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward
endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally
human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios
where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a
seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI
buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated
shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across
models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,
raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents
may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy,
platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

*Yiyi Lu,Hoi Ian Au,Junyao Zhang,Jingyu Pan,Yiting Wang,Ang Li,Jianyi Zhang,Yiran Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoEDA是一个基于MCP协议的EDA自动化框架，通过并行学习和结构化提示工程减少微调需求，提升RTL-to-GDSII流程的效率和脚本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代EDA工作流依赖手工脚本和工具特定交互，效率低且难以扩展，现有LLM解决方案需昂贵微调且缺乏标准化框架。

Method: AutoEDA利用MCP协议实现并行学习，采用结构化提示工程、智能参数提取和任务分解，并扩展CodeBLEU指标评估脚本质量。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，AutoEDA在自动化准确性、效率和脚本质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AutoEDA开源发布，支持EDA社区的标准化和可扩展自动化。

Abstract: Modern Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows, especially the
RTL-to-GDSII flow, require heavily manual scripting and demonstrate a multitude
of tool-specific interactions which limits scalability and efficiency. While
LLMs introduces strides for automation, existing LLM solutions require
expensive fine-tuning and do not contain standardized frameworks for
integration and evaluation. We introduce AutoEDA, a framework for EDA
automation that leverages paralleled learning through the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) specific for standardized and scalable natural language
experience across the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow. AutoEDA limits fine-tuning
through structured prompt engineering, implements intelligent parameter
extraction and task decomposition, and provides an extended CodeBLEU metric to
evaluate the quality of TCL scripts. Results from experiments over five
previously curated benchmarks show improvements in automation accuracy and
efficiency, as well as script quality when compared to existing methods.
AutoEDA is released open-sourced to support reproducibility and the EDA
community. Available at: https://github.com/AndyLu666/MCP-EDA-Server

### [11] [Multi-turn Natural Language to Graph Query Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01871)
*Yuanyuan Liang,Lei Pan,Tingyu Xie,Yunshi Lan,Weining Qian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLMs）的自动构建多轮NL2GQL数据集的方法，并开发了MTGQL数据集，同时提出了三种基线方法评估多轮NL2GQL翻译效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单轮NL2GQL方法无法有效处理多轮对话和复杂上下文依赖，且缺乏高质量多轮数据集。

Method: 基于LLMs的自动构建多轮NL2GQL数据集方法，并开发MTGQL数据集。

Result: 提出了三种基线方法评估多轮NL2GQL翻译效果。

Conclusion: 为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query
language (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on
single-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user
interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and
context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward
queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their
queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional
details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn
conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex
context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn
NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this
challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL
datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to
develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph
database and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we
propose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
multi-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future
research.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CAD代码生成方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了CAD设计的易用性和代码生成质量。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing
but typically requires a high level of expertise from designers. To lower the
entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD
conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts
both abstract textual descriptions and freehand sketches as input, engaging in
interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements
through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel
Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), the agent generates high-quality
CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates
iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are
stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the
agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

Conclusion: 轻量级VLM在实时边缘协同规划中可行，语言引导的上下文推理能显著提升自动驾驶的安全性和响应能力。

Abstract: Collisions caused by human error are the most common type of multi-vehicle
crash, highlighting the critical need for autonomous driving (AD) systems to
leverage cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication. This capability extends situational awareness beyond the
limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X
frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning,
and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced
reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time
performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents
REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon
a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules
that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To
ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge
adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference.
Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality
(VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation
studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation
strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for
real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of
language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in
autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模知识图谱嵌入生成效率低下的问题。

Method: 利用GPU和多节点执行优化RDF2vec流程，包括随机游走和嵌入训练。

Result: 在合成图和真实基准测试中，gpuRDF2vec显著快于现有最快工具jRDF2vec，且能处理更长游走。

Conclusion: gpuRDF2vec为大规模知识图谱嵌入生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings at web scale remains challenging.
Among existing techniques, RDF2vec combines effectiveness with strong
scalability. We present gpuRDF2vec, an open source library that harnesses
modern GPUs and supports multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the
RDF2vec pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetically generated graphs
and real-world benchmarks show that gpuRDF2vec achieves up to a substantial
speedup over the currently fastest alternative, i.e., jRDF2vec. In a
single-node setup, our walk-extraction phase alone outperforms pyRDF2vec,
SparkKGML, and jRDF2vec by a substantial margin using random walks on large/
dense graphs, and scales very well to longer walks, which typically lead to
better quality embeddings. Our implementation of gpuRDF2vec enables
practitioners and researchers to train high-quality KG embeddings on
large-scale graphs within practical time budgets and builds on top of Pytorch
Lightning for the scalable word2vec implementation.

Conclusion: 研究为改进AI透明度和性能提供了新路径，同时有助于量化用户风险和法律责任。

Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But
more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good
(correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024
alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths.
Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a
hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention
head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point
which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training
bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's
multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency,
explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users'
AI risk and legal liabilities.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了社会经济指标（如家庭财富）是否在卫星图像和互联网文本中留下可恢复的痕迹，并通过多模态框架预测财富指数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社会经济指标是否可以通过卫星图像和互联网文本反映，为财富预测提供新方法。

Method: 结合卫星图像、LLM生成文本和AI代理检索的文本，开发五种预测管道，包括视觉模型、LLM、AI代理、联合编码器和集成模型。

Result: 多模态融合优于单一模态（如R-squared 0.77 vs. 0.63），LLM知识比代理检索文本更有效，数据集包含60,000多个DHS集群。

Conclusion: 多模态方法在财富预测中表现优越，LLM知识更具鲁棒性，代理数据在某些情况下提供独特信息。

Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave
recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and
Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair
Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on
location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We
develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International
Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images,
(ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web
text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework
yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms
vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on
out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than
agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time
generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused
embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine
similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of
material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms
agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest
gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that
agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not
fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale
multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite
images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种受海马体启发的持续学习方法H2C，用于解决深度学习在轨迹预测中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在轨迹预测中表现优异，但在适应新分布时会出现灾难性遗忘，限制了其在自动驾驶中的实际应用。

Method: H2C通过选择性回忆少量学习样本，结合多样性和等概率采样策略，利用记忆回放损失函数更新模型。

Result: 实验表明，H2C在无任务依赖的情况下，平均减少了22.71%的灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: H2C有效解决了深度学习在动态分布场景中的知识保留问题，提升了自动驾驶系统的适应性。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory
prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD).
However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in
previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits
their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across
varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the
hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively
reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,
we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for
trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by
selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two
complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent
learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity
to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall
knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss
function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while
learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION
dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C
reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a
task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在情绪冲突场景中过度依赖音频信号，忽视视觉模态，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出MoSEAR框架，包含MoSE模块（减少模态偏差）和AR机制（重新分配注意力）。

Result: MoSEAR在多个基准测试中表现最优，尤其在模态冲突条件下。

Conclusion: MoSEAR有效解决情绪冲突问题，提升模型性能，无模态间权衡。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving
emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are
inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark
designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of
three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or
all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER
reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on
audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual
modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient
framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two
modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism
that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention
reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen
backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it
mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent
samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our
CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,
particularly under modality conflict conditions.

Abstract: In the age of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have emerged as
a powerful paradigm for achieving general intelligence. These agents
dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish
user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent
workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling
scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks
and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key
dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration,
external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles,
orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20
representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical
challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to
workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open
problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights
for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow
infrastructure, and safe automation.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管CoT提示被认为能提升LLM的表现，但其推理能力是否真实仍存疑，本文旨在验证其是否仅为数据分布的产物。

Method: 通过DataAlchemy环境，从零训练LLM，并系统测试其在任务、长度和格式三个维度上的表现。

Result: 研究发现CoT推理在超出训练分布时表现脆弱，效果显著下降。

Conclusion: CoT推理的泛化能力有限，其有效性依赖于训练数据与测试问题的分布一致性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Motivation: 现有代码生成基准面临高成本构建和数据集污染问题，影响评估可靠性。

Method: 基于重要性采样理论和重要性加权自编码器，通过分析提示分布预测性能，引入权重截断策略稳定估计。

Result: 在4个CodeLlama模型和9个基准上，BIS的平均绝对预测误差为1.1%，适用于多种指标。

Conclusion: BIS可靠且广泛适用，显著降低了代码相关任务中评估大语言模型的成本和努力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has
become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing
benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing
high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk
of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation
framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code
generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates
performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on
importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted
Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks
to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,
we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations
across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that
supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,
offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination
assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points
across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an
average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with
best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes
well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.
These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which
can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in
code-related tasks.

Motivation: 现有诊断模型在复杂场景（如分布偏移）中缺乏严格的风险控制和可靠的不确定性量化。

Method: 将故障检测转化为假设检验任务，利用模型残差定义非一致性度量，并通过校准数据集计算新样本的p值，构建预测集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在跨域故障诊断任务中实现了名义覆盖率的经验覆盖率，且在高风险容忍度下预测集更小。

Conclusion: 该方法为故障检测提供了理论基础，实现了明确的风险控制，提升了诊断系统的可信度。

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern
industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of
rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing
diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as
distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault
detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal
prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms
fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity
measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to
compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets
mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified
probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by
analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined
normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault
diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The
proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above
the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the
underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results
reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$)
and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction
set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for
fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the
trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and
advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,
uncertainty-aware outputs.

Motivation: 手绘草图虽然直观高效，但缺乏结构约束和语义精确性，难以自动转换为机器可读图表。

Method: SketchAgent结合草图识别、符号推理和迭代验证，生成语义连贯且结构准确的图表。

Result: 提出了Sketch2Diagram Benchmark数据集，包含6,000多个高质量示例，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SketchAgent在设计、教育和工程领域具有广泛应用前景，填补了草图与机器可读图表之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and
conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image
generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable
diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary
challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the
structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent
system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into
structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic
reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and
structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual
effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the
Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework
encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed
graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality
examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous
quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent
holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering,
while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive
sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at

Motivation: 解决模型容量与计算效率之间的权衡问题，为资源受限的语言模型部署提供高效架构。

Method: 1. 细粒度专家路由（64个微专家和top-k选择）；2. 共享专家隔离（2个常驻专家和62个专用专家）；3. 无梯度冲突负载平衡。

Result: 在17M至202M参数的模型中，KV缓存内存减少68%，推理速度提升3.2倍，验证损失降低6.9%，生成质量（连贯性、创造性和语法正确性）显著提升。

Conclusion: 架构创新而非参数扩展定义了语言模型效率的前沿。

Abstract: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines
Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary
Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach
addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational
efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with
64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization
through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation
that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6
of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that
maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss
optimization.
  Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters
demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV
cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive
perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M
parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla
transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass.
FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x
inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms
quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10),
creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish
that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency
frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

Result: win-k在AUROC、TPR @ 1% FPR和FPR @ 99% TPR等指标上优于现有方法，尤其是在更小的模型上表现更佳。

Conclusion: win-k是一种有效的针对小型语言模型的成员推理攻击方法，为隐私保护提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and
deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for
on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other
hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a
given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with
serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study
MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models
(LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore,
their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding,
we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art
attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five
existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k
outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR
metrics, especially on smaller models.

<details>

Motivation: LLMs在处理多源冲突知识时容易混淆，需要提升其在长且冲突上下文中的推理能力。

Method: 提取冲突上下文中的推理路径（文本或知识图谱），通过强化学习奖励模型选择逻辑一致的路径。

Result: 实验表明KCR显著提升了多种骨干模型在长上下文场景中解决知识冲突的能力。

Conclusion: KCR框架有效增强了LLMs解决知识冲突的能力，尤其在长上下文场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their
prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts
between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge
conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To
address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)
framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.
The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning
process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with
stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.
Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or
local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we
employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of
reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the
incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire
the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long
contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts
in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and
textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However,
existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese
and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW,
the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and
latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice
questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official
proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of
Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and
vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities,
although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end
any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using
separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model
capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and
efficient multimodal architectures.

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this
process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available
information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and
evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely
undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address
this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language
model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge
graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an
internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates
performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a
Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded
assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over
ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures.
Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration
of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few
lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a
catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

Result: 研究发现LLMs在计划生成中缺乏明确推理，恢复流程将成功率从21.9%提升至27.5%，但质量仍不及传统规划器。

Conclusion: 基于NLP的恢复流程虽能部分提升计划质量，但LLMs在规划任务中的可靠性和质量仍有限。

Abstract: The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take
unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI
planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as
planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated
actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with
LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various
planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In
this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing
(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery
pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along
with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the
LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.
This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context
of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid
plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during
plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the
plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and
reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of
the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated
plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and
increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.

*Yelim Ahn,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PUZZLED是一种新型的越狱攻击方法，通过将有害指令的关键词隐藏为字谜，利用LLM的推理能力绕过安全检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用，确保其安全性成为关键问题。现有的越狱攻击方法多依赖迭代提示工程或语义转换，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 设计了三种字谜类型（单词搜索、字谜重组、填字游戏），要求LLM解谜后生成对有害指令的响应。

Result: 在五种先进LLM上测试，平均攻击成功率达88.8%，其中GPT-4.1为96.5%，Claude 3.7 Sonnet为92.3%。

Conclusion: PUZZLED通过简单的字谜形式，高效利用LLM的推理能力，成为一种强大的越狱攻击策略。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response,
studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches
typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of
harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a
novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It
masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for
the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and
crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The
model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to
generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate
PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success
rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7
Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar
puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: 现有遗忘评估指标在实际LLM遗忘场景中缺乏实用性、精确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DCUE指标，利用验证集校正核心令牌的置信度分布偏差，并使用Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验量化评估结果。

Abstract: This paper analyzes the limitations of existing unlearning evaluation metrics
in terms of practicality, exactness, and robustness in real-world LLM
unlearning scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new metric
called Distribution Correction-based Unlearning Evaluation (DCUE). It
identifies core tokens and corrects distributional biases in their confidence
scores using a validation set. The evaluation results are quantified using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Experimental results demonstrate that DCUE overcomes
the limitations of existing metrics, which also guides the design of more
practical and reliable unlearning algorithms in the future.

Method: 设计了基于因果路径原则的Benchmark，开发了分层代理架构Agent，并通过RFT微调模型。

Result: Benchmark对现有LLM构成挑战，Claude-sonnet-4的WPSR仅为34.6%。RFT提升了小模型的性能（WPSR从3.3%升至10.8%），但在复杂场景下表现下降。

Conclusion: 研究为社区提供了严格的评估标准和高质量数据集，以指导GUI代理的未来发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User
Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of
existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and
scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel
benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm
structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic
steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for
assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of
agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically
optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a
high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse
and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this
dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.
Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to
current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved
a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT
substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR
increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling
complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of
smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception,
decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation
standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the
future development of GUI agents.

Abstract: Composable AI offers a scalable and effective paradigm for tackling complex

assessment of composable AI solutions. To establish initial baselines, we
provide human-designed reference solutions and compare their performance with
two LLM-based approaches. Our results illustrate the promise of composable AI
in addressing complex real-world problems while highlighting the need for
methods that can fully unlock its potential by automatically generating
effective execution pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于POI的预测方法无法捕捉探索性行为或城市道路网络的拓扑约束，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: 采用道路节点中心框架，结合方向性POI聚合和结构图嵌入，使用Relation-Aware LNN-Transformer进行序列建模。

Result: 在城市规模轨迹数据上，模型在准确性和MRR上显著优于六种基线方法，且抗噪性强。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了传统方法的局限性，为位置预测提供了更灵活和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human
mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic
urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting
choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to
capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints
of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that
represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph,
thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step
forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we
introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact
features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining
these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded
node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware
LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a
bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal
dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user
trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17
percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and
maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in
accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in
accuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.

Conclusion: TripTailor有望推动旅行规划代理的发展，生成更实用且满足用户需求的行程。

Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in
travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is
rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data,
failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world
itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize
constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall
quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor,
a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in
real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over
500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel
itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic
evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries
generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance.
Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including
the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed
solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel
planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while
generating practical itineraries. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on
complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has
investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and
systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid
models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to
investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified
architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five
tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph
structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how
these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable
patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why
their integration is beneficial.

Method: 提出CARGO框架，结合混合整数线性规划（MILP）精确解和高效启发式方法，优化配送路线和充电策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，与基准策略相比，充电成本分别降低了39%和22%，同时完成相似的配送量。

Conclusion: CARGO框架在电动车配送中有效降低了充电成本，为可持续物流提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: With growing interest in sustainable logistics, electric vehicle (EV)-based
deliveries offer a promising alternative for urban distribution. However, EVs
face challenges due to their limited battery capacity, requiring careful
planning for recharging. This depends on factors such as the charging point
(CP) availability, cost, proximity, and vehicles' state of charge (SoC). We
propose CARGO, a framework addressing the EV-based delivery route planning
problem (EDRP), which jointly optimizes route planning and charging for
deliveries within time windows. After proving the problem's NP-hardness, we
propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a
computationally efficient heuristic method. Using real-world datasets, we
evaluate our methods by comparing the heuristic to the MILP solution, and
benchmarking it against baseline strategies, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and
Nearest Delivery First (NDF). The results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in
the charging cost over EDF and NDF, respectively, while completing comparable
deliveries.

Conclusion: kTPG和WinkTPG有效解决了MAPF计划动力学可行性和执行不确定性问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging
problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF
algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from
directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose
kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed
optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a
kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving
collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a
MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a
window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during
execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate
speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality
by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

Conclusion: Refine-n-Judge能高效生成高质量数据集，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through
preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the
underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data
quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce
Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as
both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing
iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate
refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every
iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human
annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response
and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.
This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the
refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of
increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public
datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and
conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on
Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of
comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.
Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval
2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces
high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.

Motivation: 探讨LLM是否会继承人类认知偏见（如承诺升级），以及这些偏见是否受特定情境触发。

Method: 通过两阶段投资任务，在四种实验条件下（模型作为投资者、顾问、多代理协商、复合压力场景）进行6,500次试验。

Conclusion: LLM的偏见表现取决于社会和组织环境，对多代理系统和无监督部署有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous
decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are
trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that
systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,
where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to
prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique
challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear
whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering
conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment
task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,
multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500
trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In
individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate
strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.
However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,
N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates
(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal
escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and
personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of
escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).
These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social
and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant
implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised
operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

Abstract: Data preparation is a critical step in enhancing the usability of tabular
data and thus boosts downstream data-driven tasks. Traditional methods often
face challenges in capturing the intricate relationships within tables and
adapting to the tasks involved. Recent advances in Language Models (LMs),
especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new opportunities to automate
and support tabular data preparation. However, why LMs suit tabular data
preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use
them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In
this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular
data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition,
integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an
integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for
different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline
prospective pipelines.

Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear
temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements,
yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested
long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when
a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this
paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to
arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi
automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid
subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on
subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot
generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a
time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel
subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the
exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic
assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of
solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments.
Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter
reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing
agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in
combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a
multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches,
Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how
LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter
values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five
levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over
1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent
adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing
returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable
designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for
specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework
supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains
like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving

Abstract: This research presents LLM Pokemon League, a competitive tournament system
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent agents to simulate
strategic decision-making in Pok\'emon battles. The platform is designed to
analyze and compare the reasoning, adaptability, and tactical depth exhibited

*Jiaqing Xie,Weida Wang,Ben Gao,Zhuo Yang,Haiyuan Wan,Shufei Zhang,Tianfan Fu,Yuqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QCBench是一个定量化学基准，包含350个计算化学问题，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补LLMs在定量化学推理能力研究上的空白。

Method: 设计QCBench基准，包含7个化学子领域的350个问题，分为基础、中级和专家三个层次。

Result: 19个LLMs在任务复杂度增加时表现下降，显示语言流畅性与科学计算准确性之间的差距。

Conclusion: QCBench为未来改进（如领域自适应微调或多模态集成）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research,
enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and
material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step
quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose
QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational
chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry,
bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical
chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three
hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate
the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed
to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem
focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields.
QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals
model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork
for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal
integration. Evaluations on 19 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance
degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap
between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T-GRAG是一个动态的、时间感知的RAG框架，通过建模知识的时间演化，显著提升了知识密集型任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法忽视了知识的时间动态性，导致时间模糊、检索不敏感和语义冗余等问题。

Method: T-GRAG包含五个关键组件：时间知识图谱生成器、时间查询分解机制、三层交互检索器、源文本提取器和基于LLM的生成器。

Result: 实验表明，T-GRAG在时间约束下的检索准确性和响应相关性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 建模知识演化对长文本问答至关重要，T-GRAG为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural
language generation but remain limited in knowle-
  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external
retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured
knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods
largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as
temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,
temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over
time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph
Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal
Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into
manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that
progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a
Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that
synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce
Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual
reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.
Extensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and
GraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under
temporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge
evolution for robust long-text question answering. Our code is publicly
available on the T-GRAG

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SURE-Med是一个统一框架，通过视觉、分布和上下文三个维度减少不确定性，提升医学报告生成的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学报告生成中的视觉、标签分布和上下文不确定性，提高临床可信度。

Method: 采用Frontal-Aware View Repair Resampling模块、Token Sensitive Learning目标和Contextual Evidence Filter。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU-Xray基准测试中表现优异，达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: SURE-Med通过多维度减少不确定性，为医学报告生成提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将Chain-of-Thought（CoT）推理融入自然语言到可视化（NL2VIS）流程的方法，以提高透明度和用户交互性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏透明的推理过程，用户无法理解设计逻辑或优化输出。

Method: 设计了CoT推理流程，开发了自动标注数据集nvBench-CoT，并构建了交互式界面DeepVIS。

Result: 定量评估和用户研究表明，CoT框架显著提升了NL2VIS的质量和用户体验。

Conclusion: CoT框架为NL2VIS提供了透明且可交互的解决方案，提升了可视化生成的效果。

Abstract: Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and
communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity
with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language
models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into
visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent
reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales
and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization
(NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for
NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with
structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized
dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural
language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables
state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop
DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT
reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors,
and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative
benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate
that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing
insightful reasoning steps to users.

### [49] [ReflecSched: Solving Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling via LLM-Powered Hierarchical Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01724)
*Shijie Cao,Yuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReflecSched框架通过结合LLM的战略分析能力，解决了动态柔性作业车间调度问题中的三大关键缺陷，显著优于直接LLM基准和传统启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态柔性作业车间调度（DFJSP）是一个NP难问题，传统调度规则效率高但缺乏灵活性，而深度学习方法需要复杂的特征工程。LLM虽具潜力，但直接应用存在三大问题：长上下文悖论、启发式利用不足和短视决策。

Method: 提出ReflecSched框架，通过LLM分析多时间跨度的启发式模拟，生成“战略经验”摘要，并将其集成到最终决策模块的提示中，以指导非短视行动。

Result: 实验表明，ReflecSched显著优于直接LLM基准（71.35%胜率，2.755%相对百分比偏差降低），并超越所有评估的启发式方法。

Conclusion: ReflecSched不仅解决了LLM的三大缺陷，还在所有问题案例中与最佳启发式方法表现相当。

Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged
by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional
dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque
and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise
adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct
application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the
long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization
of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose
ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by
equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to
analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and
distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic
Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final
decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments
show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct
LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage
Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual
heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified
pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic
tailored to each instance across all problem cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HypoAgents的多智能体协作框架，结合贝叶斯推理和信息熵驱动搜索，通过生成、验证和优化假设的闭环流程，显著提升了自动生成科学假设的质量和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学知识的爆炸式增长使得自动生成兼具新颖性、可行性和研究价值的科学假设成为核心挑战，现有方法无法系统建模假设的内在特性或整合闭环反馈机制。

Method: HypoAgents框架通过多样性采样生成初始假设，基于N-R-F评分建立先验信念，利用RAG收集外部证据更新后验概率，并通过信息熵识别高不确定性假设进行优化。

Result: 在ICLR 2025数据集上，经过12次优化迭代后，假设的平均ELO评分提升116.3，超越真实论文摘要基准17.8，整体不确定性显著降低0.92。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种可解释的概率推理框架，显著提升了机器生成研究假设的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated
generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and
research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language
models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate
the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes
a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first
time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search
mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and
hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating
scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an
initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior
beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It
then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature
evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'
theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information
entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the
iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and
confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world
research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12
optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves
by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the
framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases
significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic
reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving
the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代商业约束编程求解器支持条件时间间隔和累积函数的建模，但开源求解器缺乏相关功能且实现细节未公开。

Method: 使用单一通用全局约束（Generalized Cumulative）实现建模，并设计了一种新的时间表过滤算法处理条件时间间隔任务。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法与现有求解器性能相当，能有效建模生产者-消费者调度问题，并适用于大规模问题。

Conclusion: 提出的方法填补了开源求解器的空白，为复杂调度问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative
functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint
programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of
scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers.
However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical
implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an
implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global
constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel
time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional
time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined
with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers
enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and
effectively scales to large problems.

Motivation: 为未来的推理架构分析提供基础支持，特别是在内部失败、适应或分裂可能发生的场景中。

Method: 将推理系统建模为结构化元组，包括现象、解释空间、推理和生成映射以及原则库，同时保持对具体算法或逻辑系统的中立性。

Result: 框架支持动态行为（如迭代优化和原则演化），并列举了内部标准（如一致性、完备性）和常见失败模式（如矛盾、不完备性）。

Conclusion: 目标是建立一个基础结构，以支持在结构约束下推理的理论和实践研究，而非提出具体解决方案。

Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems,
intended to support future analysis of inference architectures across domains.
We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena,
explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The
formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning
processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any
specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal
criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical
failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The
framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle
evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for
representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where
internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution
architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and
practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步数学推理中易出错，而现有的过程奖励数据构建方法效率低下或劳动密集。

Method: 提出不确定性驱动的自动化过程奖励数据构建框架，包括数据生成和标注；引入两种不确定性感知的输出聚合方法。

Result: 在ProcessBench、MATH和GSMPlus上的实验验证了框架的有效性，聚合方法进一步提升了PRMs的推理能力。

Conclusion: 该框架和方法显著提高了PRMs的训练效率和性能，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex
mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout
multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great
promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step,
thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However,
training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing
methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient.
In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process
reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation
processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority
vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation
methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which
combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on
ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output
aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across
diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at

Motivation: 现有MCP基准测试局限于单服务器和少量工具，无法有效评估代理在大规模真实场景中的能力。

Method: 提出LiveMCPBench基准测试、LiveMCPTool工具集和LiveMCPEval评估框架，并开发MCP Copilot Agent进行动态规划和API交互。

Result: 最佳模型（Claude-Sonnet-4）成功率为78.95%，但不同模型性能差异显著。

Conclusion: LiveMCPBench为评估LLM代理在复杂动态环境中的能力提供了统一框架，支持可扩展和可重复的研究。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP
servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to
single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of
agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to
evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and
reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate
LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and
527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework
that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task
environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose
the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic
planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool
suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model
(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large
performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform
poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench
offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic,
tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable
and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be
publicly available at https://icip-cas.github.io/LiveMCPBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖指标数据，因数据不平衡导致高误报率，增加了运维负担。LLM的进展为结合指标和日志数据提供了新机会。

Method: 提出CloudAnoAgent，联合处理结构化指标和文本日志数据，利用符号验证验证检测假设并生成结构化异常报告。

Result: 实验显示，CloudAnoAgent在异常分类准确率上平均提升46.36%和36.67%，误报率降低36.67%和33.89%，异常类型检测准确率提高12.8%。

Conclusion: CloudAnoAgent显著提升了检测准确性、降低了误报率并增强了可解释性，适用于企业云环境。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task.
Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high
false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous
events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance
engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and
interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the
first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud
environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual
log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate
detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that
provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly
behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy
by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on
average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on
anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting.
These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection
accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby
supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如人工标注或模拟对话）资源密集且质量受限，需要一种高效构建领域专用对话数据集的方法。

Method: 通过社区检测分割知识图谱为语义子图，逐步生成围绕目标实体的问答对，并进行严格过滤。

Result: 在医学知识图谱上验证，生成的对话在多样性、语义连贯性和实体覆盖方面表现优异，微调后的LLM性能显著提升。

Conclusion: ProKG Dial有效解决了领域对话数据集构建的挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks but often
lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high
quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing
specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual
annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are
resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain
coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive
framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets
using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the
structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships,
providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues.
Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition
the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework
incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a
target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is
employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical
knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,
semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM
on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both
automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial
substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.

TL;DR: SNOW是一种基于大型语言模型的模块化多代理系统，能够从非结构化临床笔记中自动生成结构化特征，性能接近人工特征生成方法，且无需临床专家参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）中的非结构化临床笔记包含丰富信息，但现有方法（如人工特征生成或全自动特征生成）存在效率低或缺乏可解释性的问题。

Method: SNOW通过多个专门代理（如特征发现、提取、验证等）利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动生成结构化临床特征。

Result: 在预测5年前列腺癌复发的任务中，SNOW性能（AUC-ROC: 0.761）接近人工特征生成（0.771），显著优于基线特征（0.691）和其他全自动方法。

Conclusion: SNOW展示了自主LLM系统可以大规模复制专家级特征工程，同时保持临床部署所需的可解释性。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes
that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from
these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive
manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational
feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance.
Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular
multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously
generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human
intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM
approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in
147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest
performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without
requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline
features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method
also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized
agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and
aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical
information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings
demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature
engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage
unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for
clinical deployment.

Motivation: 解决角色扮演对话中角色知识一致性和属性建模的挑战。

Method: 结合ACTS自适应分块、GS引导选择和AE属性提取，构建CharacterRAG数据集。

Result: 框架有效建模角色知识和属性，如性格。

Conclusion: AMADEUS为RAG-based RPAs提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose AMADEUS, which is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter
(ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). ACTS finds an
optimal chunk length and hierarchical contexts for each character. AE
identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and
uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency
even when answering out of knowledge questions. To facilitate the development
and evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing
dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters
totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question and answer pairs. We find
that our framework effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by
characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TraceAlign是一个框架，用于追踪大型语言模型（LLM）对齐失败的根本原因，通过Belief Conflict Index（BCI）量化语义不一致性，并提出三种干预措施以减少对齐漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM对齐失败的根本原因，提出可追溯和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 引入TraceAlign框架，使用BCI量化语义不一致性，并提出TraceShield、对比信念解冲突损失和Prov-Decode三种干预措施。

Result: 在Alignment Drift Benchmark（ADB）上减少了对齐漂移达85%，同时保持了任务实用性。

Conclusion: TraceAlign为理解和缓解对齐失败提供了首个可扩展、可追溯的工具包。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often
exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when
exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased
jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,
little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these
failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe
completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central
to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic
inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved
training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary
interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses
completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a
contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,
and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam
expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce
alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)
while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and
improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift
likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and
length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first
scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating
alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development,
we open-source our implementation at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的研究存在复杂特征处理困难或训练成本高、泛化能力差的问题，需改进。

Method: 结合检索库、图像相似性检索和大模型检索增强模块，通过提示微调整合外部知识。

Result: 在真实建筑数据上实验，识别准确率显著提升（如GLM-4V提升35.49%至50%）。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了准确性、上下文理解和稳定性，为风险检测提供了新理论和技术支持。

Abstract: The goal of construction site risk and hazard identification is to enhance
safety management through automation. Existing research based on large language
models falls into two categories: image-text matching for collaborative
reasoning, which struggles with complex hazard features, and instruction
fine-tuning or dialogue guidance using professional datasets, which suffers
from high training costs and poor generalization.To address this, we propose a
hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement. By
integrating external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt
fine-tuning, we mitigate misjudgments caused by limited domain knowledge and
weak feature associations. Our method includes three modules: retrieval
library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement,
enabling efficient recognition without training. Experiments on real
construction data show significant improvements. For instance, GLM-4V's
recognition accuracy increased to 50\%, a 35.49\% boost. The method enhances
accuracy, context understanding, and stability, offering new theoretical and
technical support for hazard detection.

Conclusion: MAC-SPGG通过结构化激励设计，实现了高效、可扩展的多LLM协作。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks
collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and
collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel,
game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the
Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to
systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM
agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs
to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,
effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its
sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a
streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining
strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under
realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles
outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other
cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale
models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results
highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for
scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上，SE-Agent实现了55%的相对改进，达到开源代理中的最佳性能。

Conclusion: SE-Agent通过自我进化机制显著提升了LLM代理的推理能力和任务解决效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive
capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with
their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated
tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory
leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain
rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving
problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they
ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of
search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To
address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that
enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach
revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:
revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables
two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by
intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,
and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance
performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through
these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that
incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench
Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five
strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative
improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source
agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly
available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人系统需要精确的3D目标位姿，无法直接利用手绘草图，限制了非专家的使用。

Method: 引入抽象关系图连接草图与3D结构，结合组合扩散模型和迭代更新预测隐藏支撑。

Result: 在标志性建筑和现代房屋设计中，StackItUp生成的3D结构稳定且视觉相似度高。

Conclusion: StackItUp为非专家提供了一种高效、直观的3D结构生成方法。

Abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to
life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches
directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand
structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system
that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D
front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph
to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements,
capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability
patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from
sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion
models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear
supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on
sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently
produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both
stability and visual resemblance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大语言模型（LLM）代理的新型攻击方式——Attractive Metadata Attack（AMA），通过操纵工具元数据来影响代理行为，无需修改代理框架即可实现高成功率攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理依赖外部工具，但工具元数据的操纵未被充分研究，可能成为新的攻击面。

Method: 提出AMA框架，通过迭代优化生成具有吸引力的工具元数据，无需修改代理执行框架。

Result: 在多种场景和LLM代理中，攻击成功率达81%-95%，且对主任务影响极小。

Conclusion: 元数据操纵是一种隐蔽且有效的攻击方式，需开发执行级安全机制以应对此类威胁。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However,
this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack
surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,
descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify
this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be
preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or
access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we
propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning
framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically
valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates
seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the
agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,
simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate
consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy
leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack
remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured
tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic
vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that
metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface,
highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond
prompt-level defenses.

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research
hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among
them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional
performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of
R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models
enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by
incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection
through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of
these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,
when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long
reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced
reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this
end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce
the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and
reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the
field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing
works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization
versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which
focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)
Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing
reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we
maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in
efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to
advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and
interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention.
However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of
agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently
encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity,
hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed.
Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse.
To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations
with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the
challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper
begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing
them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a
novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent
System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations
of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and
resolution.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态掩码稀疏注意力机制（DMA），通过内容感知和位置感知的稀疏性，显著降低计算复杂度，同时保持信息完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准自注意力机制的二次复杂度问题，避免现有稀疏注意力机制的静态模式或信息丢失问题。

Method: DMA通过动态生成内容感知稀疏掩码和位置感知稀疏注意力计算，实现高效的长上下文建模。

Result: 实验表明，DMA在困惑度和多查询关联召回任务中优于多种注意力机制，并在1.7B参数模型中表现突出。

Conclusion: DMA能有效平衡模型效率和长上下文建模能力。

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly
increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention
mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention
mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as
static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask
sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes
content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key
innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from
value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical
information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention
computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This
dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational
complexity of important information while retaining complete information,
achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational
efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive
experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head
attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native
sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.
Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also
demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.
Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly
outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the
challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its
capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability
effectively.

Result: 玩家评分、访谈和情感分析表明，情感弧线的整合显著提升了游戏的吸引力、叙事连贯性和情感冲击力。

Conclusion: 情感结构化的程序生成在交互式叙事中具有潜力，为游戏叙事设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories
across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology,
often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a
framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional
arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics.
Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical
analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide
the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically
populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g.,
health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional
trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our
system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large
language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation. Evaluation through
player ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc
integration significantly enhances engagement, narrative coherence, and
emotional impact. These results highlight the potential of emotionally
structured procedural generation for advancing interactive storytelling for
games.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）常因过度思考（生成冗长的推理轨迹）而影响效率和可解释性，现有方法仅关注缩短响应长度，未深入分析推理过程的语义结构。

Method: 提出双惩罚强化学习框架：1）滑动窗口语义分析惩罚内部冗余（FCS内低贡献推理步骤）；2）惩罚外部冗余（FCS后的不必要延续）以鼓励提前终止。

Result: 方法显著压缩推理轨迹且准确性损失极小，并能泛化至问答和代码生成等任务。外部冗余可安全移除，内部冗余需谨慎减少以避免损害正确性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提升推理效率，还实现了对思维链长度的隐式语义控制，为更简洁、可解释的LRMs铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce excessively verbose reasoning
traces, a phenomenon known as overthinking, which hampers both efficiency and
interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response
length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the
reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it
into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of
low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and
external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To
mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning
framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis
to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the
correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the
FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses
reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,
we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading
performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to
avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only
improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control
over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable
LRMs.

Conclusion: 该架构为跨认知领域的类脑智能提供了理论基础，有望缩小人工与生物智能的差距。

Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited
flexible, generalizable intelligence. This limitation stems from their
fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural
regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for
coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired
architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and
executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the
simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic
adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible
and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with
2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by
48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns.
Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture
establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across
cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and
biological intelligence.

Abstract: We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE)
minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in
arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy
minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem
into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational
techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space
models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on
environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially
observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform
conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and
efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld
environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially
observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.
This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations,
providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in
artificial agents.

*Dewi Sid William Gould,George De Ath,Ben Carvell,Nick Pepper*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AirTrafficGen利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动化生成复杂的空中交通控制（ATC）训练场景，解决了手动设计场景的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计ATC训练场景耗时且限制了模拟的多样性，需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用基于图的表示方法编码空域拓扑，结合LLMs生成高流量场景，并通过提示工程实现细粒度控制。

Result: 实验表明，Gemini 2.5 Pro和OpenAI o3等模型能生成具有操作真实性的场景，并能通过文本反馈迭代改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为ATC训练提供了可扩展的自动化方案，展示了LLMs在安全关键领域复杂规划中的潜力。

Abstract: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a
demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of
simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel,
end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method
uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology
(including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can
process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst
maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained
control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest
these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed
scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable
alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume
and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work
showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical
domains.

*Xingchen Zou,Yuhao Yang,Zheng Chen,Xixuan Hao,Yiqi Chen,Chao Huang,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Traffic-R1是一个基于强化大语言模型（LLM）的交通信号控制（TSC）基础模型，具有人类推理能力，能零样本泛化、轻量级实时推理，并支持可解释性和多路口通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习（RL）和LLM方法在交通信号控制中存在泛化能力不足、计算资源需求高和缺乏可解释性等问题，Traffic-R1旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过自探索和迭代的强化LLM，结合专家指导和模拟交通环境训练，开发了Traffic-R1。其3B参数架构支持轻量级实时推理，并引入同步通信网络。

Result: Traffic-R1在基准测试中表现优异，优于传统RL和LLM方法，目前已管理超过55,000名司机的信号，平均队列缩短5%以上，操作员工作量减半。

Conclusion: Traffic-R1为交通信号控制提供了高效、可扩展且可解释的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is vital for mitigating congestion and
sustaining urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation
model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through
self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with
expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers
three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot
generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and
out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control
policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is
lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling
large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC
process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its
self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive
benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,
outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In
practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,
shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our
checkpoint is available at https://huggingface.co/Season998/Traffic-R1.

Result: 实验表明，混合策略显著提升了MAC任务的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态情感计算的未来研究提供了有价值的见解和优化方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) aims to recognize and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from diverse modalities such as text,
video, and audio. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have significantly reshaped the landscape of MAC by offering a unified
framework for processing and aligning cross-modal information. However,
practical challenges remain, including performance variability across complex
MAC tasks and insufficient understanding of how architectural designs and data
characteristics impact affective analysis. To address these gaps, we conduct a
systematic benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs capable
of concurrently processing audio, visual, and textual modalities across
multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the
performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model
optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset
properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines
generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs'
affective computing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this
integrated approach significantly improves performance across various MAC
tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in this
field. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/MLLM-MAC.

Motivation: 现有评估方法在PHM领域对大模型的评估不够全面，阻碍了LLMs与PHM的深度整合。

Method: 提出PHM-Bench框架，基于基础能力、核心任务和全生命周期三个维度，定义多级评估指标，并结合案例集和公开数据集进行多维评估。

Result: PHM-Bench为PHM领域的大规模模型评估提供了方法论基础，并为从通用模型向PHM专用模型的过渡提供了关键基准。

Conclusion: PHM-Bench填补了PHM领域LLMs评估的空白，推动了LLMs在PHM中的深入应用。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering
new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models
help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles,
and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM
and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural
completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This
hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these
limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional
evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic
structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench
is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines
multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic
generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,
including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and
maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly
available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation
of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.
PHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of
LLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from
general-purpose to PHM-specialized models.

Conclusion: OptiHive通过高效生成和筛选组件，解决了LLM求解器的延迟和不可靠问题，显著提升了优化问题的求解性能。

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem
modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on
iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce
OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for
optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative
self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse
components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out
erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account
the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to
infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification
and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems
to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive
significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to
92\% on the most complex problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂任务中生成的推理链存在冗余和重复问题，原因是后训练过度依赖结果奖励范式，缺乏对中间推理步骤的调控。

Method: 提出PI框架，包含When、How、Which三个模块，动态干预推理路径，整合人类问题解决经验和认知科学原理。

Result: 实验表明，PI显著缩短推理链，减少幻觉，生成更简洁可靠的推理。

Conclusion: PI框架有效提升LLM推理的效率和可控性，为复杂任务提供更优解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model
(LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought
(CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing
evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by
excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive
reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely
on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which
regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To
address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt
Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate
reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How
module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This
allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be
seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability
and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,
yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在PMA预测中缺乏透明度和可解释性的问题，以支持临床决策。

Method: 采用指令调优和低秩适应（LoRA）对Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型进行参数高效微调，训练数据为新生儿MRI扫描的四种2D皮质表面投影图。

Result: 模型预测误差较低（95%置信区间为0.78至1.52周），并能生成基于发育特征的可解释输出。

Conclusion: 该方法在围产期神经科学中实现了透明且可信的AI系统，为临床提供了更可靠的决策支持。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for
assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have
achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as
black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical
decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and
interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to
perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation
generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy
using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the
Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface
projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts
for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a
regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations
during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a
95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing
interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant
step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.

Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂数学推理中因深层结构依赖而表现不佳的问题。

Method: 1. 学习阶段：结合LLM先验和因果发现算法构建MCG，并通过迭代反馈优化。2. 推理阶段：动态提取任务相关子图，注入LLM以指导推理。

Result: 实验表明CAMA显著提升LLM在数学问题上的性能，结构化引导优于非结构化方法，非对称因果关系比对称关联更有效。

Conclusion: CAMA通过显式、可重用的数学结构，有效提升了LLM的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician
(\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit,
reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs
the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a
high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with
causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The
resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.
To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines
the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the
question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA
dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both
the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,
which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal
dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning
process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly
improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms
unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal
relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations
alone.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 探讨了Noosemia动态的哲学、认识论和社会影响，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel
cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with
generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal
exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under
certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even
interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,
but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological
complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical
notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct
meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the
human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,
animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its
unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the
phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with
reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social
implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法在提升公平性和政策效率方面具有潜力，尤其适用于涉及多变量交互的高风险场景。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of
America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring
equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,
water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the
sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables
related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe
negative impact on communities.

Conclusion: D2PPO有效解决了表示崩溃问题，显著提升了复杂机器人操作的性能，并在实际机器人实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling
multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless,
diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically
similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately
impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for
complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO
(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces
dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating
all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels
the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,
thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences
necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer
regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply
enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,
D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after
fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of
real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high
success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident
in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/

Abstract: In document classification, graph-based models effectively capture document
structure, overcoming sequence length limitations and enhancing contextual
understanding. However, most existing graph document representations rely on
heuristics, domain-specific rules, or expert knowledge. Unlike previous
approaches, we propose a method to learn data-driven graph structures,
eliminating the need for manual design and reducing domain dependence. Our
approach constructs homogeneous weighted graphs with sentences as nodes, while
edges are learned via a self-attention model that identifies dependencies
between sentence pairs. A statistical filtering strategy aims to retain only
strongly correlated sentences, improving graph quality while reducing the graph
size. Experiments on three document classification datasets demonstrate that
learned graphs consistently outperform heuristic-based graphs, achieving higher
accuracy and $F_1$ score. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the effectiveness
of the statistical filtering in improving classification robustness. These
results highlight the potential of automatic graph generation over traditional
heuristic approaches and open new directions for broader applications in NLP.

language outputs that are not grounded in the input, reference materials, or
real-world knowledge. In enterprise applications where AI features support
business decisions, such hallucinations can be particularly detrimental. LLMs
that analyze and summarize contact center conversations introduce a unique set
of challenges for factuality evaluation, because ground-truth labels often do
not exist for analytical interpretations about sentiments captured in the
conversation and root causes of the business problems. To remedy this, we first
introduce a \textbf{3D} -- \textbf{Decompose, Decouple, Detach} -- paradigm in
the human annotation guideline and the LLM-judges' prompt to ground the
factuality labels in linguistically-informed evaluation criteria. We then
introduce \textbf{FECT}, a novel benchmark dataset for \textbf{F}actuality
\textbf{E}valuation of Interpretive AI-Generated \textbf{C}laims in Contact
Center Conversation \textbf{T}ranscripts, labeled under our 3D paradigm.
Lastly, we report our findings from aligning LLM-judges on the 3D paradigm.
Overall, our findings contribute a new approach for automatically evaluating
the factuality of outputs generated by an AI system for analyzing contact
center conversations.

TL;DR: XAutoLM是一个基于元学习的AutoML框架，用于高效优化语言模型的微调流程，通过复用历史经验减少计算开销和环境负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化框架未能同时解决模型选择和超参数优化问题，导致语言模型微调的计算成本和环境影响较高。

Method: XAutoLM利用任务和系统级元特征，从历史成功和失败中学习，优化采样策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，XAutoLM表现优于零样本优化器，显著减少评估时间和错误率，并发现更多高效流程。

Conclusion: XAutoLM为资源高效的NLP模型微调提供了有效解决方案，推动了绿色AI的发展。

Abstract: Experts in machine learning leverage domain knowledge to navigate decisions
in model selection, hyperparameter optimisation, and resource allocation. This
is particularly critical for fine-tuning language models (LMs), where repeated
trials incur substantial computational overhead and environmental impact.
However, no existing automated framework simultaneously tackles the entire
model selection and HPO task for resource-efficient LM fine-tuning. We
introduce XAutoLM, a meta-learning-augmented AutoML framework that reuses past
experiences to optimise discriminative and generative LM fine-tuning pipelines
efficiently. XAutoLM learns from stored successes and failures by extracting
task- and system-level meta-features to bias its sampling toward fruitful
configurations and away from costly dead ends. On four text classification and
two question-answering benchmarks, XAutoLM surpasses zero-shot optimiser's peak
F1 on five of six tasks, cuts mean evaluation time by up to 4.5x, reduces error
ratios by up to sevenfold, and uncovers up to 50% more pipelines above the
zero-shot Pareto front. In contrast, simpler memory-based baselines suffer
negative transfer. We release XAutoLM and our experience store to catalyse
resource-efficient, Green AI fine-tuning in the NLP community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应RAG框架MAO-ARAG，通过多智能体协同动态规划工作流，以平衡问答系统的性能和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决固定RAG管道在不同查询中性能和成本效率不平衡的问题。

Result: 在多个QA数据集上验证，MAO-ARAG能提供高质量答案，同时控制成本和延迟。

Conclusion: MAO-ARAG通过动态规划工作流，显著提升了问答系统的适应性和效率。

Abstract: In question-answering (QA) systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
become pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination
issues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing
single-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address
different types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world
queries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost
efficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent
orchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.
Specifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG
modules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and
generation agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the
appropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for
each query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable
costs. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement
learning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based
penalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a
reasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate
that our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only
achieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within
acceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on

TL;DR: 论文提出了UrBLiMP基准，用于评估多语言大模型在低资源语言（如乌尔都语）中的语法知识，发现模型表现参差不齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型在低资源语言（如乌尔都语）上的数据不足，需评估其语法知识。

Method: 构建UrBLiMP数据集（5,696对最小差异句），评估20个多语言大模型。

Result: LLaMA-3-70B表现最佳（94.73%），但与其他顶级模型（如Gemma-3-27B-PT）无显著差异。

Conclusion: 当前多语言大模型在低资源语言的细粒度语法知识上既有潜力也有局限。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance
across various languages; however, they often include significantly less data
for low-resource languages such as Urdu compared to high-resource languages
like English. To assess the linguistic knowledge of LLMs in Urdu, we present
the Urdu Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (UrBLiMP) i.e. pairs of
minimally different sentences that contrast in grammatical acceptability.
UrBLiMP comprises 5,696 minimal pairs targeting ten core syntactic phenomena,
carefully curated using the Urdu Treebank and diverse Urdu text corpora. A
human evaluation of UrBLiMP annotations yielded a 96.10% inter-annotator
agreement, confirming the reliability of the dataset. We evaluate twenty
multilingual LLMs on UrBLiMP, revealing significant variation in performance
across linguistic phenomena. While LLaMA-3-70B achieves the highest average
accuracy (94.73%), its performance is statistically comparable to other top
models such as Gemma-3-27B-PT. These findings highlight both the potential and
the limitations of current multilingual LLMs in capturing fine-grained
syntactic knowledge in low-resource languages.

TL;DR: Pinterest提出了一种高效且经济的结构化数据提取系统，通过结合网页的结构、视觉和文本信息，使用简单模型（如XGBoost）实现了比复杂模型（如GPT）更高的准确性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网中存在大量非结构化信息，将其转换为结构化格式是一个重大挑战。Pinterest需要从电商网站准确提取结构化产品数据以提升用户体验和内容分发效率。

Method: 采用一种新颖的网页表示方法，将结构、视觉和文本模态结合为紧凑形式，适用于小型模型学习。每个可见HTML节点及其文本、样式和布局信息均被捕获。

Result: 系统在准确性上优于复杂的大型语言模型（如GPT），且具有高度可扩展性，每秒可处理超过1000个URL，成本效益比最便宜的GPT替代方案高1000倍。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了简单模型在特定任务中可以超越复杂模型，同时具备高效率和低成本的优势。

Abstract: The internet offers a massive repository of unstructured information, but
it's a significant challenge to convert this into a structured format. At
Pinterest, the ability to accurately extract structured product data from
e-commerce websites is essential to enhance user experiences and improve
content distribution. In this paper, we present Pinterest's system for
attribute extraction, which achieves remarkable accuracy and scalability at a
manageable cost. Our approach leverages a novel webpage representation that
combines structural, visual, and text modalities into a compact form,
optimizing it for small model learning. This representation captures each
visible HTML node with its text, style and layout information. We show how this
allows simple models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to extract
attributes more accurately than much more complex Large Language Models (LLMs)
such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Our results demonstrate a
system that is highly scalable, processing over 1,000 URLs per second, while
being 1000 times more cost-effective than the cheapest GPT alternatives.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在生成临床咨询模板中的实用性，以提升临床信息交换效率。

Method: 使用145个专家模板，通过多代理流程（提示优化、语义自动评分和优先级分析）测试多个前沿模型。

Result: 模型如o3在全面性上达92.2%，但模板过长且优先级排序不准确，叙事驱动领域表现显著下降。

Conclusion: LLMs可提升临床信息交换，但需更鲁棒的评估方法以优化优先级排序和实用性。

Abstract: This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate
structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using
145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's
eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2,
Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to
produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question
schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic
autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3
achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate
excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically
important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across
specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as
psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance
structured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting
the need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to
prioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of
real-world physician communication.

Conclusion: 分语言微调的预训练多语言LLM是跨语言情感检测的有效方法。

Abstract: Detecting emotions across different languages is challenging due to the
varied and culturally nuanced ways of emotional expressions. The
\textit{Semeval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based emotion} shared
task was organised to investigate emotion recognition across different

identify the basic emotional states that general third-party observers would
attribute to an author based on their written text snippet, along with the
intensity of those emotions. We report our investigation of various
task-adaptation strategies for LLMs in emotion recognition. We show that the
most effective method for this task is to fine-tune a pre-trained multilingual
LLM with LoRA setting separately for each language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AdaCoRe的任务，旨在通过轻量级策略（如后缀优化SOP）限制LLM生成特定受限内容，而无需微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM的输出空间广泛且内容限制需求因用户群体和时间变化而异，传统的监督微调方法不切实际，因此需要轻量级解决方案。

Method: 提出Suffix Optimization (SOP)方法，通过在提示后附加优化的短后缀，防止LLM生成受限内容，同时保持输出质量。

Result: 在CoReBench基准测试中，SOP在多个LLM模型上的平均限制率显著优于基线方法（如系统后缀）。

Conclusion: SOP是一种实用且高效的轻量级方法，适用于实际场景中的内容限制需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across
diverse applications. However, enforcing content restrictions remains a
significant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of
content restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via
model alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need
for content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change
rapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of
harmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical
due to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this
need, we propose a new task called \textit{Adaptive Content Restriction}
(AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model
fine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for
specific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named
\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to
any prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted
terms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,
including our SOP, we create a new \textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}
(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8
carefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on
CoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix
by 15\%, 17\%, 10\%, 9\%, and 6\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B,
Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively. We also
demonstrate that SOP is effective on POE, an online platform hosting various
commercial LLMs, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新任务，将聊天查询分割为请求内容、角色、查询特定上下文和附加表达，并分析了用户行为模式及其随时间的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聊天日志提供了关于LLM用户的丰富信息，但用户行为模式常被查询的变异性掩盖。

Method: 提出新任务，分割聊天查询，并进行历时分析。

Result: 发现用户行为模式随时间变化，早期强调请求，用户随经验趋于收敛，模型能力影响用户行为。

Conclusion: 研究为理解LLM用户行为提供了新视角，模型更新对用户行为有显著影响。

Abstract: Chat logs provide a rich source of information about LLM users, but patterns
of user behavior are often masked by the variability of queries. We present a
new task, segmenting chat queries into contents of requests, roles,
query-specific context, and additional expressions. We find that, despite the
familiarity of chat-based interaction, request-making in LLM queries remains
significantly different from comparable human-human interactions. With the data
resource, we introduce an important perspective of diachronic analyses with
user expressions. We find that query patterns vary between early ones
emphasizing requests, and individual users explore patterns but tend to
converge with experience. Finally, we show that model capabilities affect user
behavior, particularly with the introduction of new models, which are traceable
at the community level.

TL;DR: WebDS是首个端到端的基于网络的数据科学基准测试，包含870个任务，覆盖29个网站，旨在评估复杂、多步骤的数据科学工作流。现有SOTA LLM代理表现不佳，仅完成15%的任务。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试过于简化或局限于静态数据集，无法反映真实数据科学任务的多模态、多步骤特性。

Method: 开发WebDS基准测试，包含多样化的任务和网站，要求代理使用工具处理异构数据。

Result: SOTA LLM代理在WebDS上表现较差（15%完成率），暴露出信息基础薄弱、重复行为和走捷径等问题。

Conclusion: WebDS为开发实用的LLM数据科学工具提供了更真实的测试平台。

Abstract: A large portion of real-world data science tasks are complex and require
multi-hop web-based interactions: finding appropriate data available on the
internet, synthesizing real-time data of various modalities from different
locations, and producing summarized analyses. Existing web benchmarks often
focus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce
transactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required
for web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks
typically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not
assess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning,
analysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first
end-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data
science tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data
portals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex,
multi-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats
that better reflect the realities of modern data analytics. Evaluations of
current SOTA LLM agents indicate significant performance gaps in accomplishing
these tasks. For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web
Voyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis
suggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding,
repetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks
display. By providing a more robust and realistic testing ground, WebDS sets
the stage for significant advances in the development of practically useful
LLM-based data science.

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，WarriorMath平均性能提升12.57%，达到新的最佳水平。

Conclusion: 缺陷感知的多专家框架能有效提升LLMs的数学能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in solving mathematical problems, yet
their performance is often limited by the availability of high-quality, diverse
training data. Existing methods focus on augmenting datasets through rephrasing
or difficulty progression but overlook the specific failure modes of LLMs. This
results in synthetic questions that the model can already solve, providing
minimal performance gains. To address this, we propose WarriorMath, a
defect-aware framework for mathematical problem solving that integrates both
targeted data synthesis and progressive training. In the synthesis stage, we
employ multiple expert LLMs in a collaborative process to generate, critique,
and refine problems. Questions that base LLMs fail to solve are identified and
iteratively improved through expert-level feedback, producing high-quality,
defect-aware training data. In the training stage, we introduce a progressive
learning framework that iteratively fine-tunes the model using increasingly
challenging data tailored to its weaknesses. Experiments on six mathematical
benchmarks show that WarriorMath outperforms strong baselines by 12.57% on
average, setting a new state-of-the-art. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of a defect-aware, multi-expert framework for improving
mathematical ability.

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has
intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons
have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have
directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a
hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of
Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and
Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International
Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked
participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering
student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based
natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,
solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or
hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed
via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student
review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the
challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation
protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI
hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and
symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable
insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research
initiatives.

Result: 在两种知识图谱QA数据集上验证了唤醒效果，并在新任务Unseen Entity KGQA中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 唤醒方法在实际应用中更有效，优于依赖嵌入相似性的传统方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows impressive performance by
supplementing and substituting parametric knowledge in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Retrieved knowledge can be divided into three types: explicit answer
evidence, implicit answer clue, and insufficient answer context which can be
further categorized into totally irrelevant and partially relevant information.
Effectively utilizing partially relevant knowledge remains a key challenge for
RAG systems, especially in incomplete knowledge base retrieval. Contrary to the
conventional view, we propose a new perspective: LLMs can be awakened via
partially relevant knowledge already embedded in LLMs. To comprehensively
investigate this phenomenon, the triplets located in the gold reasoning path
and their variants are used to construct partially relevant knowledge by
removing the path that contains the answer. We provide theoretical analysis of
the awakening effect in LLMs and support our hypothesis with experiments on two
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) Question Answering (QA) datasets. Furthermore, we
present a new task, Unseen Entity KGQA, simulating real-world challenges where
entity linking fails due to KG incompleteness. Our awakening-based approach
demonstrates greater efficacy in practical applications, outperforms
traditional methods that rely on embedding-based similarity which are prone to
returning noisy information.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven impressive
progress in omni-modal understanding and generation. However, training
omni-modal LLMs remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneous model

sophisticated system design for efficient large-scale training. Existing

limited scalability and substantial engineering overhead for end-to-end
omni-modal training. % We present \veomni, a modular and efficient training
framework to accelerate the development of omni-modal LLMs. \veomni introduces
model-centric distributed recipes that decouples communication from

features a flexible configuration interface supporting seamless integration of
new modalities with minimal code change. % Using \veomni, a omni-modal

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to modify outdated knowledge in large language models
(LLMs) efficiently while retaining their powerful capabilities. Most existing
methods rely on either parameter-level editing or retrieval-based approaches.
In this work, we propose Knowledge Editing alignment with Diverse Augmentation
and Self-adaptive inference (KEDAS) to better align LLMs with knowledge
editing. In the alignment phase, LLMs learn to apply in-context edited
knowledge via low-rank adaptation. During editing, we design a diverse edit
augmentation technique to improve the recall of edits. After that, a
self-adaptive post-alignment inference mechanism is proposed, in which a
filter-based smart retriever is employed to perform a dynamic selection of
inference routing. Specifically, irrelevant queries will go through the
original pre-alignment model directly, while relevant ones, together with their
related edits, go through the model with aligned adapters activated. In
experiments, KEDAS secures the highest overall performance scores in 35 out of
36 cases across four datasets with three LLMs on three settings, surpassing its
strong knowledge editing alignment counterpart by about 19.8 harmonic mean
scores of edit success, locality and portability and outperforming both
parameter editing and retrieval-based baselines significantly. Analysis of
computational cost and performance on general tasks further validates the
robustness and efficiency of KEDAS, indicating that it presents an ideal
paradigm of knowledge editing alignment.

TL;DR: D-SCoRE是一种无需训练的方法，利用LLMs和提示工程从任意文本生成高质量QA数据集，支持领域特定LLMs的监督微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量QA数据集稀缺且昂贵的问题，支持领域特定LLMs的监督微调。

Method: 结合文档中心处理、分段、CoT推理和结构化导出，生成QA-CoT数据集，并通过多维度控制机制增强多样性和相关性。

Result: D-SCoRE生成的QA数据集在多个领域测试中表现优于人工标注数据集，且生成效率高。

Conclusion: D-SCoRE是一种简单、可扩展的方法，能高效生成高质量QA数据集，支持跨领域的高性能微调。

Abstract: The scarcity and high cost of high-quality question-answering (QA) datasets
hinder supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for domain-specific large language models
(LLMs). To address this, we introduce D-SCoRE, a training-free pipeline that
utilizes LLMs and prompt engineering to produce diverse, high-quality QA
datasets from arbitrary textual sources. D-SCoRE integrates
$\textbf{D}$ocument-centric processing, $\textbf{S}$egmentation, $\textbf{Co}$T
$\textbf{R}$easoning, and structured $\textbf{E}$xport to generate QA-COT
datasets tailored for domain-aware SFT. Multi-dimensional control mechanisms,
such as semantic role transformation, question type balancing, and
counterfactual materials, enhance diversity and relevance, overcoming
limitations of existing QA generation. LLMs fine-tuned on D-SCoRE-generated QA
datasets, and human-annotated QA datasets (SQuAD, Covid-QA) are evaluated on
SQuADShifts and Covid-QA test sets, with D-SCoRE outperforming across most
domains. D-SCoRE generates six QA-CoT pairs with four-option counterfactual
materials per 100-200-word text in 90 seconds using an 8B LLM on consumer-grade
hardware. Its simplicity and scalability enable efficient QA generation and
high-performance fine-tuning across domains.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型训练数据稀缺且多样性不足的问题。

Method: 通过构建知识图谱，结合路径采样和扩散合成技术，生成多学科、多难度的QA数据。

Result: 合成的LinkQA数据集在Llama-3 8B上持续预训练后，MMLU和CMMLU平均提升11.51%。

Conclusion: LinkSyn和LinkQA显著提升模型性能，适用于不同规模和初始FLOPs的模型。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) struggles with the scarcity
of high-quality, diverse training data. To address this limitation, we propose
LinkSyn, a novel knowledge point (KP) graph-based synthesis framework that
enables flexible control over discipline and difficulty distributions while
balancing KP coverage and popularity. LinkSyn extracts KPs from
question-answering (QA) seed data and constructs a KP graph to synthesize
diverse QA data from multiple seeds strongly linked by KPs and sampled from
graph walks. Specifically, LinkSyn incorporates (1) a knowledge distribution
value function to guide the adjustment of path sampling probability and balance
KP coverage and popularity during graph walks; (2) diffusion-based synthesis
via DeepSeek-R1 by leveraging multiple seeds with dense logical associations
along each path; and (3) high-difficulty QA enhancement within given
disciplines by flexible difficulty adjustments. By executing LinkSyn, we
synthesize LinkQA, a diverse multi-disciplinary QA dataset with 50B tokens.
Extensive experiments on Llama-3 8B demonstrate that continual pre-training
with LinkQA yields an average improvement of $\mathbf{11.51\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU, establishing new SOTA results. LinkQA consistently enhances performance
across model size and initial FLOPs scales.

Conclusion: BoostQA方法有效提升了模型性能，并展示了良好的可扩展性，为知识密集型数据集的构建提供了新思路。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, knowledge-intensive training data hinders the
development of large language models (LLMs), as traditional corpora provide
limited information. Previous studies have synthesized and integrated
corpora-dependent question-answering (QA) data to improve model performance but
face challenges in QA data scalability and knowledge diversity, particularly in
cross-domain contexts. Furthermore, leveraging our designed discipline and
difficulty annotation system, we probe model deficiencies in STEM disciplines
and high-difficulty data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
diversified pipeline to synthesize BoostQA, a 100B-token large-scale QA
dataset. Our synthesis framework: (1) curates seed data from heterogeneous
sources; (2) utilizes DeepSeek-R1 to implement STEM-focused multi-grade
synthesis to boost data diversity and high-difficulty synthesis to mitigate
difficulty degradation; (3) refines answers via DeepSeek-V3 to improve output
quality. We utilize BoostQA in mid-training, a mid-stage between pre-training
and post-training, to optimize domain-specific knowledge acquisition and
enhance data quality. Our method enables Llama-3 8B, mid-trained on a 40B-token
dataset, to achieve an average improvement of $\mathbf{12.74\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU and establish SOTA average performance across 12 benchmarks. BoostQA also
demonstrates robust scalability, with performance consistently improving as
model size, data volume, and initial FLOPs scale.

At its core, the system employs specialized agents - Researcher, Reviewer,
Writer, and Retriever - that collaborate to analyze data and produce
comprehensive reports. These agents learn from real professional consultants'
presentation materials at Amazon through in-context learning to replicate
professional analytical methodologies. The framework executes a multi-step
process: querying databases, analyzing data, generating insights, creating
visualizations, and composing market reports. We also introduce a novel
LLM-based evaluation system for assessing report quality, which shows alignment
with expert human evaluations. Building on these evaluations, we implement an
iterative improvement mechanism that optimizes report quality through automated
review cycles. Experimental results show that report quality can be improved by
both automated review cycles and consultants' unstructured knowledge. In
experimental validation, our framework generates detailed 6-page reports in 7
minutes at a cost of approximately \$1. Our work could be an important step to
automatically create affordable market insights.

Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖预定义的身份-概念关联，无法捕捉新或意外的偏见形式。

Method: 提出Bias Association Discovery Framework (BADF)，从开放生成内容中提取身份与概念的关联。

Result: BADF在多模型和多样场景下验证，能全面映射和分析偏见关联。

Conclusion: BADF为LLM中的偏见分析提供了可扩展工具，增进了对开放生成偏见的理解。

Abstract: Social biases embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) raise critical
concerns, resulting in representational harms -- unfair or distorted portrayals
of demographic groups -- that may be expressed in subtle ways through generated
language. Existing evaluation methods often depend on predefined
identity-concept associations, limiting their ability to surface new or
unexpected forms of bias. In this work, we present the Bias Association
Discovery Framework (BADF), a systematic approach for extracting both known and
previously unrecognized associations between demographic identities and
descriptive concepts from open-ended LLM outputs. Through comprehensive
experiments spanning multiple models and diverse real-world contexts, BADF
enables robust mapping and analysis of the varied concepts that characterize
demographic identities. Our findings advance the understanding of biases in
open-ended generation and provide a scalable tool for identifying and analyzing
bias associations in LLMs. Data, code, and results are available at

Motivation: LLMs在多跳问答任务中因无法捕捉深层实体关系而表现不佳，ORACLE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ORACLE分三阶段：动态构建问题特定知识本体，转化为一阶逻辑推理链，系统分解查询为子问题。

Result: 在多个MQA基准测试中表现优异，媲美当前最优模型，生成更逻辑和可解释的推理链。

Conclusion: ORACLE框架有效提升了LLMs在多跳问答任务中的性能，生成更合理的推理过程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering,
exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that
necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their
inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities.
To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven
**R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a
training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the
structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three
stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies
using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic
reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into
logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA
benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance,
rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses
further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that
our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than
existing approaches.

Motivation: 现有SFT方法依赖未过滤数据集，导致计算成本高且性能不佳。传统方法仅基于样本难度选择数据，忽略了梯度影响，无法平衡复杂推理与优化效果。

Method: 提出Difficulty-Influence Quadrant（DIQ）策略，优先选择高难度-高梯度影响的样本，以平衡复杂推理与优化效果。

Result: 实验表明，DIQ仅需1%的数据即可达到全数据集性能，10%数据时性能优于基线。人类和LLM评估显示DIQ生成更符合专家实践的临床推理。

Conclusion: DIQ通过平衡样本难度和梯度影响，显著提升医学推理效率和质量，优于传统数据选择方法。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However,
existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant
and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and
suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this
problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and
reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility
reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence
alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but
lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly
complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this
observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence
Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence
quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient
influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data.
Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected
subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is
more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and
evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning
patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match
full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the
baseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over
brute-force scaling. The code and data are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于AST的语法感知扩散框架，用于改进代码生成任务中的扩散模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在结构化领域（如源代码）中的应用面临挑战，因为编程语言需要遵循严格的语法和语义规则，而传统的随机标记损坏方法忽略了这些结构。

Method: 通过从AST子树中提取有语法意义的代码片段进行选择性损坏，而非随机损坏标记，以保持代码的层次结构和语法正确性。

Result: 实验表明，语法感知损坏显著提高了语法正确性、重构准确性和对未见代码模式的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将结构信息融入扩散模型训练是一种有前景的方向，语法引导的去噪有助于提升代码生成任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based language models have opened new
possibilities for controllable and bidirectional sequence generation. These
models provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by
framing text generation as an iterative denoising process. However, applying
diffusion models to structured domains such as source code remains a
significant challenge. Programming languages differ from natural language in
that they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical
organization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level
corruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which
may hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To
address this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that
incorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the
denoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we
selectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST
subtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects
grammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental
results demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves
syntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen
code patterns. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating
structural information into diffusion-based training and suggest that
syntax-guided denoising is a promising direction for advancing diffusion-based
language models in code generation tasks.

edition of the BioASQ challenge, which involves biomedical semantic
question-answering for Task 13b and biomedical question-answering for
developing topics for the Synergy task. We deploy a selection of open-source

all possible model combinations to contribute to the final answer, resulting in
tailored LLM pipelines for each question type. Our findings provide valuable

Abstract: In the Indian subcontinent, Telugu, one of India's six classical languages,
is the most widely spoken Dravidian Language. Despite its 96 million speaker
base worldwide, Telugu remains underrepresented in the global NLP and Machine
Learning landscape, mainly due to lack of high-quality annotated resources.
This work introduces TeSent, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for sentiment
classification, a key text classification problem, in Telugu. TeSent not only
provides ground truth labels for the sentences, but also supplements with
provisions for evaluating explainability and fairness, two critical
requirements in modern-day machine learning tasks. We scraped Telugu texts
covering multiple domains from various social media platforms, news websites
and web-blogs to preprocess and generate 26,150 sentences, and developed a
custom-built annotation platform and a carefully crafted annotation protocol
for collecting the ground truth labels along with their human-annotated
rationales. We then fine-tuned several SOTA pre-trained models in two ways:
with rationales, and without rationales. Further, we provide a detailed
plausibility and faithfulness evaluation suite, which exploits the rationales,
for six widely used post-hoc explainers applied on the trained models. Lastly,
we curate TeEEC, Equity Evaluation Corpus in Telugu, a corpus to evaluate
fairness of Telugu sentiment and emotion related NLP tasks, and provide a
fairness evaluation suite for the trained classifier models. Our experimental
results suggest that training with rationales may improve model accuracy,
reduce bias in models, and make the explainers' output more aligned to human
reasoning.

Result: LLMs通过反映和强化训练数据中的主流模式，可能加剧认知同质化，威胁集体智慧和适应能力。

Conclusion: 若不加以控制，LLMs的认知同质化风险可能削弱社会所需的多样性和适应性。

Abstract: Cognitive diversity, reflected in variations of language, perspective, and
reasoning, is essential to creativity and collective intelligence. This
diversity is rich and grounded in culture, history, and individual experience.
Yet as large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in people's lives,
they risk standardizing language and reasoning. This Review synthesizes
evidence across linguistics, cognitive, and computer science to show how LLMs
reflect and reinforce dominant styles while marginalizing alternative voices
and reasoning strategies. We examine how their design and widespread use
contribute to this effect by mirroring patterns in their training data and
amplifying convergence as all people increasingly rely on the same models
across contexts. Unchecked, this homogenization risks flattening the cognitive
landscapes that drive collective intelligence and adaptability.

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for unlocking the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Still, since manual prompt design is often complex,
non-intuitive, and time-consuming, automatic prompt optimization has emerged as
a research area. However, a significant challenge in prompt optimization is
managing the inherent trade-off between task performance, such as accuracy, and
context size. Most existing automated methods focus on a single objective,
typically performance, thereby failing to explore the critical spectrum of
efficiency and effectiveness. This paper introduces the MOPrompt, a novel
Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization (EMO) framework designed to optimize
prompts for both accuracy and context size (measured in tokens) simultaneously.
Our framework maps the Pareto front of prompt solutions, presenting
practitioners with a set of trade-offs between context size and performance, a
crucial tool for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications. We evaluate MOPrompt on a sentiment analysis task in Portuguese,
using Gemma-2B and Sabiazinho-3 as evaluation models. Our findings show that
MOPrompt substantially outperforms the baseline framework. For the Sabiazinho
model, MOPrompt identifies a prompt that achieves the same peak accuracy (0.97)
as the best baseline solution, but with a 31% reduction in token length.

Result: 在多个数据集和LLMs上，ComPerturb达到最高攻击成功率，验证了提示结构感知的重要性。

Conclusion: 提示结构感知和可控扰动对LLMs的对抗鲁棒性评估至关重要。

Abstract: Prompt-based adversarial attacks have become an effective means to assess the
robustness of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often
treat prompts as monolithic text, overlooking their structural
heterogeneity-different prompt components contribute unequally to adversarial
robustness. Prior works like PromptRobust assume prompts are value-neutral, but
our analysis reveals that complex, domain-specific prompts with rich structures
have components with differing vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we
introduce PromptAnatomy, an automated framework that dissects prompts into
functional components and generates diverse, interpretable adversarial examples
by selectively perturbing each component using our proposed method, ComPerturb.
To ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts, we further
incorporate a perplexity (PPL)-based filtering mechanism. As a complementary
resource, we annotate four public instruction-tuning datasets using the
PromptAnatomy framework, verified through human review. Extensive experiments
across these datasets and five advanced LLMs demonstrate that ComPerturb
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Ablation studies validate the
complementary benefits of prompt dissection and PPL filtering. Our results
underscore the importance of prompt structure awareness and controlled
perturbation for reliable adversarial robustness evaluation in LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Yujiaaaaa/PACP.

*Maziyar Panahi*

TL;DR: OpenMed NER 是一种开源、领域适应的 NER 模型，通过轻量级预训练和参数高效微调，在生物医学 NER 任务中取得领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学领域 NER 任务中高性能与计算效率的平衡问题。

Method: 结合领域自适应预训练（DAPT）和低秩适应（LoRA），使用公开数据集训练，微调时仅更新少量参数。

Result: 在 12 个生物医学 NER 基准测试中，10 个达到最新最优性能，部分任务提升显著。

Conclusion: 开源模型通过策略性优化可超越闭源方案，同时高效且环保。

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) is fundamental to extracting structured
information from the >80% of healthcare data that resides in unstructured
clinical notes and biomedical literature. Despite recent advances with large
language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse entity
types while maintaining computational efficiency remains a significant
challenge. We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted
transformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT)
with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach performs
cost-effective DAPT on a 350k-passage corpus compiled from ethically sourced,
publicly available research repositories and de-identified clinical notes
(PubMed, arXiv, and MIMIC-III) using DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA
backbones. This is followed by task-specific fine-tuning with LoRA, which
updates less than 1.5% of model parameters. We evaluate our models on 12
established biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and
species. OpenMed NER achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of
these 12 datasets, with substantial gains across diverse entity types. Our
models advance the state-of-the-art on foundational disease and chemical
benchmarks (e.g., BC5CDR-Disease, +2.70 pp), while delivering even larger
improvements of over 5.3 and 9.7 percentage points on more specialized gene and
clinical cell line corpora. This work demonstrates that strategically adapted
open-source models can surpass closed-source solutions. This performance is
achieved with remarkable efficiency: training completes in under 12 hours on a
single GPU with a low carbon footprint (< 1.2 kg CO2e), producing permissively
licensed, open-source checkpoints designed to help practitioners facilitate
compliance with emerging data protection and AI regulations, such as the EU AI
Act.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）生成文本的逼真度提高，区分机器生成文本（MGT）与人类写作内容变得困难，而现有的作者归属（AA）研究主要局限于单语言（如英语），忽视了多语言场景。

Method: 研究聚焦18种语言和8种生成器（7种LLM和人类作者），评估单语言AA方法在多语言环境中的适用性、跨语言迁移能力及生成器对归属性能的影响。

Result: 结果显示，部分单语言AA方法可适应多语言环境，但在跨语言家族迁移时存在显著局限性，突显了多语言AA的复杂性。

Conclusion: 多语言AA需要更鲁棒的方法以匹配现实场景，现有方法仍需改进。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have reached human-like fluency and
coherence, distinguishing machine-generated text (MGT) from human-written
content becomes increasingly difficult. While early efforts in MGT detection
have focused on binary classification, the growing landscape and diversity of
LLMs require a more fine-grained yet challenging authorship attribution (AA),
i.e., being able to identify the precise generator (LLM or human) behind a
text. However, AA remains nowadays confined to a monolingual setting, with
English being the most investigated one, overlooking the multilingual nature
and usage of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce the problem of
Multilingual Authorship Attribution, which involves attributing texts to human
or multiple LLM generators across diverse languages. Focusing on 18 languages
-- covering multiple families and writing scripts -- and 8 generators (7 LLMs
and the human-authored class), we investigate the multilingual suitability of
monolingual AA methods, their cross-lingual transferability, and the impact of
generators on attribution performance. Our results reveal that while certain
monolingual AA methods can be adapted to multilingual settings, significant
limitations and challenges remain, particularly in transferring across diverse
language families, underscoring the complexity of multilingual AA and the need
for more robust approaches to better match real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实用户偏好是动态且依赖上下文的，而现有LLMs通常假设静态偏好。

Method: 引入CUPID基准，评估LLMs基于历史交互推断新请求中相关偏好的能力。

Result: 评估10种LLMs，发现其偏好推断和上下文关联能力不足（精度<50%，召回<65%）。

Conclusion: 需提升LLMs在动态偏好情境下的个性化能力，CUPID可作为改进资源。

Abstract: Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold
static preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold
dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact
with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual
preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure
alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated
interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In
each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and
expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user
request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can
infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that
satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary
LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from
multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant
to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the
need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized
interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM采用单向评估范式，无法利用全局上下文验证早期步骤的一致性。

Method: BiPRM通过修改提示实现双向评估，无需额外参数或延迟。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，BiPRM比单向基线提升31.9%的步骤奖励评估。

Conclusion: BiPRM高效、兼容性强，为过程奖励建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assigning fine-grained
scores to intermediate reasoning steps within a solution trajectory. However,
existing PRMs predominantly adopt a unidirectional left-to-right (L2R)
evaluation paradigm, which limits their ability to leverage global context,
making it challenging to verify the consistency of earlier steps based on later
ones. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel bidirectional evaluation
paradigm, named Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM). BiPRM seamlessly
incorporates a parallel right-to-left (R2L) evaluation stream alongside the
conventional L2R flow, enabling later reasoning steps to help assess earlier
ones in real time. Notably, the built-in R2L evaluation is implemented solely
through prompt modifications that reverse the original reasoning trajectory,
without any additional parameters or inference latency introduced. This ensures
BiPRM remains both efficient and broadly compatible with existing PRM studies.
We conduct extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks using
samples generated by three different policy models. Our method, BiPRM, is
evaluated across three backbones and three distinct PRM objectives. Across all
settings, BiPRM consistently outperforms unidirectional baselines, achieving up
to a 31.9% improvement in stepwise reward evaluation. Generally, our results
highlight BiPRM's effectiveness, robustness, and general applicability,
offering a promising new direction for process-based reward modeling.

Result: 实验表明，CoCoA-zero和CoCoA在开放领域和多跳问答任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: CoCoA框架通过显式协同参数化与检索知识，显著提升了RAG的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework for
enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in
knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often
struggle to *fully exploit knowledge during generation*. In particular, the
synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external
retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead
generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more
accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a
framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and
retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent
RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then
reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training
strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from
CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability
to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved
knowledge. Experiments results show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior
performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.

Result: 模型规模增大可减少表达泄漏，但需专门处理；负面情感提示比正面情感更易导致表达泄漏。

Conclusion: 表达泄漏需在模型构建中专门处理，提示无法缓解，负面情感对生成的干扰更强。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced natural language processing (NLP)
skills such as through next-token prediction and self-attention, but their
ability to integrate broad context also makes them prone to incorporating
irrelevant information. Prior work has focused on semantic leakage, bias
introduced by semantically irrelevant context. In this paper, we introduce
expression leakage, a novel phenomenon where LLMs systematically generate
sentimentally charged expressions that are semantically unrelated to the input
context. To analyse the expression leakage, we collect a benchmark dataset
along with a scheme to automatically generate a dataset from free-form text
from common-crawl. In addition, we propose an automatic evaluation pipeline
that correlates well with human judgment, which accelerates the benchmarking by
decoupling from the need of annotation for each analysed model. Our experiments
show that, as the model scales in the parameter space, the expression leakage
reduces within the same LLM family. On the other hand, we demonstrate that
expression leakage mitigation requires specific care during the model building
process, and cannot be mitigated by prompting. In addition, our experiments
indicate that, when negative sentiment is injected in the prompt, it disrupts
the generation process more than the positive sentiment, causing a higher
expression leakage rate.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications
highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in
English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to
the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present
CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality
safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage
synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation,
cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This
pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the
Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct
languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese.
The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1,
comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of
Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning.
The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual
content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on
multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe
responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a
significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling
the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

Conclusion: IterChat通过简化标注流程和生成高质量数据，有效解决了多轮偏好提取的挑战。

Abstract: Identifying user preferences in dialogue systems is a pivotal aspect of
providing satisfying services. Current research shows that using large language
models (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields
excellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization. However, the primary
challenge stems from the inherent difficulty in obtaining high-quality labeled
multi-turn dialogue data. Accurately tracking user preference transitions
across turns not only demands intensive domain expertise and contextual
consistency maintenance for annotators (termed \textbf{``Annotating
Disaster''}) but also complicates model training due to error propagation in
sequential dependency learning. Inspired by the observation that multi-turn
preference extraction can be decomposed into iterative executions of one-turn
extraction processes. We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework
named \textbf{IterChat}. First, we construct a new data format that categorizes
the dialogue data into attributed historical preferences and one-turn
dialogues. This reduces the probability of annotation errors and improves
annotation efficiency. Then, to generate a high-quality and diverse dialogue
dataset, we adopt GPT4 to pre-define the preference slots in the target
preference extractor task and then randomly sample the subset of the slots and
their corresponding schema values to create the dialogue datasets. Experimental
results indicate that fine-tuning or only few-shot prompting with the new
dialogue format yields superior performance compared to the original multi-turn
dialogues. Additionally, the new data format improves annotator efficiency with
a win rate of 28.4\% higher than the original multi-turn dialogues.

Motivation: 现有AI生成文本检测方法忽略了位置信息，导致对局部对抗性扰动的检测失败。研究发现AI文本具有显著的非平稳性，需要新的检测方法。

Method: 提出Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT)，将标记级差异视为时间序列信号，应用连续小波变换生成二维时间尺度表示。

Result: TDT在RAID基准测试中AUROC达到0.855（提升7.1%），在对抗性任务中AUROC提升14.1%，计算开销仅增加13%。

Conclusion: TDT证明了非平稳性是AI生成文本的基本特征，保留时间动态信息对鲁棒检测至关重要。

Abstract: The field of AI-generated text detection has evolved from supervised
classification to zero-shot statistical analysis. However, current approaches
share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into
scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur.
Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant
non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text
segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing
detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this
overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT),
a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by
reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level
discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform
to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the
location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark,
TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More
importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with
14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its
sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\%
computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental
characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal
dynamics is essential for robust detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their propensity for hallucination, generating plausible but factually
incorrect or fabricated content, remains a critical challenge. This report
provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, beginning with a
formal definition and a theoretical framework that posits its inherent
inevitability in computable LLMs, irrespective of architecture or training. It
explores core distinctions, differentiating between intrinsic (contradicting
input context) and extrinsic (inconsistent with training data or reality), as
well as factuality (absolute correctness) and faithfulness (adherence to
input). The report then details specific manifestations, including factual
errors, contextual and logical inconsistencies, temporal disorientation,
ethical violations, and task-specific hallucinations across domains like code
generation and multimodal applications. It analyzes the underlying causes,
categorizing them into data-related issues, model-related factors, and
prompt-related influences. Furthermore, the report examines cognitive and human
factors influencing hallucination perception, surveys evaluation benchmarks and
metrics for detection, and outlines architectural and systemic mitigation
strategies. Finally, it introduces web-based resources for monitoring LLM
releases and performance. This report underscores the complex, multifaceted
nature of LLM hallucinations and emphasizes that, given their theoretical
inevitability, future efforts must focus on robust detection, mitigation, and
continuous human oversight for responsible and reliable deployment in critical
applications.

Method: 设计了新的标注指南、众包协议和评估指标，创建了包含30,147个问答对的HeQ数据集。

Result: 发现标准评估指标（如F1和EM）不适用于希伯来语，并提出了改进方法；模型在形态句法和MRC任务上的表现相关性低。

Conclusion: HeQ的开发揭示了形态丰富语言在NLU中的挑战，为希伯来语和其他类似语言的NLU模型发展提供了支持。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Hebrew Natural Language Processing (NLP) focus mainly
on morpho-syntactic tasks, neglecting the semantic dimension of language
understanding. To bridge this gap, we set out to deliver a Hebrew Machine
Reading Comprehension (MRC) dataset, where MRC is to be realized as extractive
Question Answering. The morphologically rich nature of Hebrew poses a challenge
to this endeavor: the indeterminacy and non-transparency of span boundaries in
morphologically complex forms lead to annotation inconsistencies,
disagreements, and flaws in standard evaluation metrics.
  To remedy this, we devise a novel set of guidelines, a controlled
crowdsourcing protocol, and revised evaluation metrics that are suitable for
the morphologically rich nature of the language. Our resulting benchmark, HeQ
(Hebrew QA), features 30,147 diverse question-answer pairs derived from both
Hebrew Wikipedia articles and Israeli tech news. Our empirical investigation
reveals that standard evaluation metrics such as F1 scores and Exact Match (EM)
are not appropriate for Hebrew (and other MRLs), and we propose a relevant
enhancement.
  In addition, our experiments show low correlation between models' performance
on morpho-syntactic tasks and on MRC, which suggests that models designed for
the former might underperform on semantics-heavy tasks. The development and
exploration of HeQ illustrate some of the challenges MRLs pose in natural
language understanding (NLU), fostering progression towards more and better NLU
models for Hebrew and other MRLs.

Abstract: Question answering over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGQA) involves
reasoning across diverse schemas, incomplete alignments, and distributed data
sources. Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific
fine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their
generalizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries
spanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains
such as the circular economy, where information about classifications,
processes, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge
graphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes
KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval,
query generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different
graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects
structurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic
validation and counterfactual consistency checks. Experiments on real-world
circular economy KGs demonstrate that AgenticT$^2$S improves execution accuracy

*Rubin Wei,Jiaqi Cao,Jiarui Wang,Jushi Kai,Qipeng Guo,Bowen Zhou,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过预训练的可微分外部记忆（MLP）来解耦LLM的记忆功能，以减少幻觉问题，并在性能和推理速度上显著优于传统解码器模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代解码器LLM在知识密集型任务中常出现幻觉问题，而检索增强生成（RAG）的静态特性限制了其与LLM的深度交互。

Method: 使用预训练的MLP作为外部记忆，模仿检索器行为，与Transformer解码器结合，分别通过语言建模和检索器模仿进行预训练。

Result: 在WikiText-103和Web数据集上分别提升17.5%和24.1%，推理速度比解码器模型快1.3倍，并在幻觉和记忆密集型任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少幻觉，提升性能和推理效率，未来将开源代码和模型。

Abstract: While modern decoder-only LLMs achieve superior performance across various
domains, hallucinations have risen to be a common problem in their generated
text, hindering their application in knowledge-intensive tasks.
Retriever-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution, but the non-parametric
nature of the retriever hinders its deep interaction with LLM. In this work, we
propose to decouple memorization from the LLM decoder using a pretrained,
differentiable external memory. The external memory is an MLP pretrained by
imitating the behavior of a retriever on the entire pretraining dataset. Our
resulting architecture, which comprises a transformer decoder and an external
MLP memory pretrained on language modeling and retriever imitation
respectively, demonstrates strong perplexity and performance on downstream
tasks. Experiments show our architecture exhibits steeper power-law scaling
with model size, achieving 17.5% and 24.1% improvement on WikiText-103 and Web
datasets compared to decoder-only models while benefiting from added training
without overfitting. We demonstrate superior performance on three hallucination
benchmarks and nine memory-intensive tasks. Additionally, our approach delivers
$80\times$ speedup over $k$NN-LM (500M tokens) and $1.3\times$ faster inference
than decoder-only models. Unlike $k$NN-LM, which impairs reasoning, our MLP
memory improves StrategyQA performance. We will open-source our code and models
in the future.

Conclusion: 框架和数据集为网页代理的知识获取和推理提供了系统支持，并在评估中表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of
web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin
to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire
sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore,
we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge
content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose
Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and
Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the
agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two
knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive
processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining
the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we
construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world
websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web
agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon
which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason
and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through
a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing
and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation
reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in
generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable
rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation
suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated
knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities. Our code and data is open sourced

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Counterfactual Probing的新方法，用于检测和减少大语言模型中的幻觉输出。该方法通过生成看似合理但包含细微事实错误的假想陈述，评估模型对这些扰动的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然表现出色，但常生成流畅但事实错误或无依据的幻觉输出，需要一种有效的方法来检测和减少这些错误。

Method: 动态生成包含细微错误的假想陈述，评估模型对这些扰动的敏感性，区分真实知识与幻觉内容。

Result: 在TruthfulQA等数据集上，该方法优于基线方法，幻觉分数平均降低24.5%。

Conclusion: Counterfactual Probing无需重新训练模型，可作为实时验证机制集成到现有LLM流程中。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, yet they frequently generate hallucinations outputs that are
fluent but factually incorrect or unsupported. We propose Counterfactual
Probing, a novel approach for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM
outputs. Our method dynamically generates counterfactual statements that appear
plausible but contain subtle factual errors, then evaluates the model's
sensitivity to these perturbations. We hypothesize that genuine knowledge
exhibits robustness to counterfactual variations, while hallucinated content
shows inconsistent confidence patterns when confronted with plausible
alternatives. Our comprehensive evaluation on TruthfulQA, factual statement
datasets, and curated hallucination examples demonstrates that counterfactual
probing achieves superior detection performance compared to baseline methods,
while our adaptive mitigation strategies reduce hallucination scores by an
average of 24.5%. The approach requires no model retraining and can be
integrated into existing LLM pipelines as a realtime verification mechanism.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PunGPT2是首个完全开源的旁遮普语大语言模型套件，通过优化的分词器和检索增强生成框架（Pun-RAG）提升性能，并引入量子启发的检索系统（Quantum-RAG）提升上下文相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言（如旁遮普语）在NLP领域长期被忽视，PunGPT2旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用35GB多样化语料库训练PunGPT2，优化分词器，开发Pun-RAG和Quantum-RAG混合检索系统，并通过QLoRA实现参数高效的指令调优。

Result: PunGPT2在多语言基线模型（如mBERT、mT5）上显著提升了困惑度、事实性和流畅性。

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源语言扩展LLM能力提供了可扩展、可复制的方案，并首次将量子表示应用于低资源语言生成。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), low-resource
languages remain largely excluded from the NLP landscape. We present PunGPT2,
the first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained
from scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious
texts, news, and social discourse. Unlike prior multilingual approaches,
PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi
through a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically
aligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall,
we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining
PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We
further develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant
using QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance
with significantly reduced compute needs.
  As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system
that fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic
matching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving
via quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual
relevance with minimal memory overhead marking the first practical integration
of quantum representations in low-resource language generation. Our models
significantly outperform strong multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in
perplexity, factuality, and fluency. This work provides a scalable,
reproducible blueprint for extending LLM capabilities to underrepresented
languages and pioneers quantum-aware retrieval in low-resource NLP

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）过度使用某些词汇（如'delve'和'intricate'）的原因，发现人类反馈学习（LHF）是主要因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs过度使用特定词汇的原因尚不明确，研究旨在揭示LHF对词汇选择的影响。

Method: 使用Meta的Llama模型，通过实验模拟LHF过程，检测LLMs的词汇偏好。

Result: 实验表明，LHF导致参与者更偏好包含特定词汇的文本，揭示了词汇过度使用的根源。

Conclusion: 词汇过度使用反映了LLMs与用户期望的偏差，强调了数据和过程透明在AI对齐研究中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to overuse certain terms like "delve"
and "intricate." The exact reasons for these lexical choices, however, have
been unclear. Using Meta's Llama model, this study investigates the
contribution of Learning from Human Feedback (LHF), under which we subsume
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization.
We present a straightforward procedure for detecting the lexical preferences of
LLMs that are potentially LHF-induced. Next, we more conclusively link LHF to
lexical overuse by experimentally emulating the LHF procedure and demonstrating
that participants systematically prefer text variants that include certain
words. This lexical overuse can be seen as a sort of misalignment, though our
study highlights the potential divergence between the lexical expectations of
different populations -- namely LHF workers versus LLM users. Our work
contributes to the growing body of research on explainable artificial
intelligence and emphasizes the importance of both data and procedural
transparency in alignment research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROVER框架通过递归分解长视频轨迹为短子任务段，提升视觉语言模型在视频推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在需要推理长视频帧序列的场景中表现不佳，限制了其在具身任务中的应用。

Method: 提出ROVER框架，递归分解长视频轨迹为短子任务段，结合上下文学习实现局部推理。

Result: 在OpenX Embodiment和RoboCasa数据集上，ROVER在任务进度估计、帧级自然语言推理和视频问答任务中优于基线。

Conclusion: ROVER通过减少每步推理的帧数，缓解幻觉问题，且时间复杂度线性增长，优于基线方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across
diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require
reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits
their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame
sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task
attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo
Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose
long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks
within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate
reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global
context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,
on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa
that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert
trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong
baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,
frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We
observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each
timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or
non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the
implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time
complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over
baselines. Demos, code, and data available at: https://rover-vlm.github.io

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长文档时，由于上下文依赖和嵌入模型容量限制，检索性能提升有限。需要一种能有效结合局部和全局信息的方法。

Method: 提出情境嵌入模型（SitEmb），通过新的训练范式将短文本块的嵌入与其上下文结合，提升检索性能。

Result: SitEmb模型在书情节检索数据集上显著优于现有模型，1B参数的SitEmb-v1表现优于7-8B参数的模型，8B参数的SitEmb-v1.5性能进一步提升10%。

Conclusion: 情境嵌入模型能有效解决长文档检索中的上下文依赖问题，显著提升性能，并在多语言和下游任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over long documents typically involves
splitting the text into smaller chunks, which serve as the basic units for
retrieval. However, due to dependencies across the original document,
contextual information is often essential for accurately interpreting each
chunk. To address this, prior work has explored encoding longer context windows
to produce embeddings for longer chunks. Despite these efforts, gains in
retrieval and downstream tasks remain limited. This is because (1) longer
chunks strain the capacity of embedding models due to the increased amount of
information they must encode, and (2) many real-world applications still
require returning localized evidence due to constraints on model or human
bandwidth.
  We propose an alternative approach to this challenge by representing short
chunks in a way that is conditioned on a broader context window to enhance
retrieval performance -- i.e., situating a chunk's meaning within its context.
We further show that existing embedding models are not well-equipped to encode
such situated context effectively, and thus introduce a new training paradigm
and develop the situated embedding models (SitEmb). To evaluate our method, we
curate a book-plot retrieval dataset specifically designed to assess situated
retrieval capabilities. On this benchmark, our SitEmb-v1 model based on BGE-M3
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art embedding models, including several
with up to 7-8B parameters, with only 1B parameters. Our 8B SitEmb-v1.5 model
further improves performance by over 10% and shows strong results across
different languages and several downstream applications.

Abstract: To address the severe data scarcity in Tibetan, a low-resource language
spoken by over six million people, we introduce TIBSTC-CoT, the large-scale,
multi-domain Tibetan dataset automatically constructed via chain-of-thought

Sunshine-thinking LLM family, a series of Tibetan-centric LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought capabilities. Trained entirely on TIBSTC-CoT,
Sunshine-thinking has demonstrated strong reasoning and generation performance,
comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multilingual LLMs. Our work marks a

Motivation: 电商产品页面信息混杂，易导致用户认知过载，现有PQA系统未能有效利用用户上下文和多样化产品信息。

Method: 采用RAG框架，整合会话历史、用户画像和产品属性，处理客观、主观和多意图查询。

Result: 系统能够提供相关且个性化的答案，并识别产品目录中的信息缺口以支持内容改进。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和新型评估指标为RAG系统在电商PQA中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: E-commerce product pages contain a mix of structured specifications,
unstructured reviews, and contextual elements like personalized offers or
regional variants. Although informative, this volume can lead to cognitive
overload, making it difficult for users to quickly and accurately find the
information they need. Existing Product Question Answering (PQA) systems often
fail to utilize rich user context and diverse product information effectively.
We propose a scalable, end-to-end framework for e-commerce PQA using Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) that deeply integrates contextual understanding. Our
system leverages conversational history, user profiles, and product attributes
to deliver relevant and personalized answers. It adeptly handles objective,
subjective, and multi-intent queries across heterogeneous sources, while also
identifying information gaps in the catalog to support ongoing content
improvement. We also introduce novel metrics to measure the framework's
performance which are broadly applicable for RAG system evaluations.

Abstract: Social media, such as Twitter, provides opportunities for caregivers of
dementia patients to share their experiences and seek support for a variety of
reasons. Availability of this information online also paves the way for the
development of internet-based interventions in their support. However, for this
purpose, tweets written by caregivers of dementia patients must first be
identified. This paper demonstrates our system for the SMM4H 2025 shared task
3, which focuses on detecting tweets posted by individuals who have a family
member with dementia. The task is outlined as a binary classification problem,
differentiating between tweets that mention dementia in the context of a family
member and those that do not. Our solution to this problem explores large
language models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a
simple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results. Our
final system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.95 on the validation set and the
test set. Our full code is available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 通过发布数据、代码和基线模型，为语音驱动的多模态角色扮演研究提供了基础，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recently, role-playing agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving personalized interaction and emotional resonance. Existing research
primarily focuses on the textual modality, neglecting the critical dimension of
speech in realistic interactive scenarios. In particular, there is a lack of
systematic evaluation for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs). To address this
gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that
comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn
conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including
timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing.
Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation
benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as
fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing
fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both
cascaded and end-to-end speech role-playing agents in maintaining vocal style
consistency and role coherence. We release all data, code, and baseline models
to provide a solid foundation for speech-driven multimodal role-playing
research and to foster further developments in this field.

Motivation: 现有评测主要关注表面感知能力，而忽略了模型在语音场景中的上下文和推理能力。

Method: SpeechR通过三种评测格式（选择题、生成式、声学特征）评估模型在事实检索、程序推理和规范性判断三个维度的表现。

Result: 评测11个先进模型后发现，高转录准确率并不等同于强推理能力。

Conclusion: SpeechR为语音推理提供了结构化评测基准，有助于更精准地分析模型在多样化对话任务中的能力。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) have achieved near-human performance in
sentence-level transcription and emotion recognition. However, existing
evaluations focus mainly on surface-level perception, leaving the capacity of
models for contextual and inference-driven reasoning in speech-based scenarios
insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we introduce SpeechR, a unified
benchmark for evaluating reasoning over speech in large audio-language models.
SpeechR evaluates models along three key dimensions: factual retrieval,
procedural inference, and normative judgment. It includes three distinct
evaluation formats. The multiple-choice version measures answer selection
accuracy. The generative version assesses the coherence and logical consistency
of reasoning chains. The acoustic-feature version investigates whether
variations in stress and emotion affect reasoning performance. Evaluations on
eleven state-of-the-art LALMs reveal that high transcription accuracy does not
translate into strong reasoning capabilities. SpeechR establishes a structured
benchmark for evaluating reasoning in spoken language, enabling more targeted
analysis of model capabilities across diverse dialogue-based tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理任务中表现良好，但对输入微小变化的敏感性引发了对模型是否过度依赖记忆的担忧。

Method: 提出STIM框架，通过统计共现分析将推理链中的每个标记归因于局部、中程或远程记忆源。

Result: 研究发现局部记忆是错误的主要驱动因素，导致高达67%的错误标记，STIM的记忆分数能有效预测错误标记。

Conclusion: STIM为诊断和改进模型推理提供了强大工具，并可推广到其他结构化逐步生成任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on reasoning benchmarks but often
fail when inputs alter slightly, raising concerns about the extent to which
their success relies on memorization. This issue is especially acute in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, where spurious memorized patterns can trigger
intermediate errors that cascade into incorrect final answers. We introduce
STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of
Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of
multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on
their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our
token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that
models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local
memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of
wrong tokens. We also show that memorization scores from STIM can be effective
in predicting the wrong tokens in the wrong reasoning step. STIM offers a
powerful tool for diagnosing and improving model reasoning and can generalize
to other structured step-wise generation tasks.

embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support
comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality

demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in
both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis
were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance
in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial
advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间敏感问答（TSQA）评估基准依赖人工或固定模板，难以扩展和全面评估。

Method: 利用时间数据库和数据库技术（如时间SQL和函数依赖）系统构建TSQA对，并引入时间准确性指标评估模型解释的时间有效性。

Result: 实验表明TDBench能实现可扩展和全面的TSQA评估，减少人工依赖，并支持应用特定数据和多跳问题生成。

Conclusion: TDBench为时间敏感问答评估提供了更可靠和全面的解决方案，补充了现有基于维基百科/维基数据的评估方法。

Abstract: Facts evolve over time, making it essential for Large Language Models (LLMs)
to handle time-sensitive factual knowledge accurately and reliably. While
factual Time-Sensitive Question-Answering (TSQA) tasks have been widely
studied, existing benchmarks often rely on manual curation or a small, fixed
set of predefined templates, which restricts scalable and comprehensive TSQA
evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose TDBench, a new benchmark
that systematically constructs TSQA pairs by harnessing temporal databases and
database techniques such as temporal SQL and functional dependencies. We also
introduce a fine-grained evaluation metric called time accuracy, which assesses
the validity of time references in model explanations alongside traditional
answer accuracy to enable a more reliable TSQA evaluation. Extensive
experiments on contemporary LLMs show how \ours{} enables scalable and
comprehensive TSQA evaluation while reducing the reliance on human labor,
complementing existing Wikipedia/Wikidata-based TSQA evaluation approaches by
enabling LLM evaluation on application-specific data and seamless multi-hop
question generation. Code and data are publicly available at:

### [145] [ProCut: LLM Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02053)
*Zhentao Xu,Fengyi Li,Albert Chen,Xiaofeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProCut是一种无需训练的提示压缩框架，通过归因分析减少提示长度，同时保持或提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模工业LLM系统中，提示模板膨胀导致维护困难、推理延迟和成本增加。

Method: ProCut将提示模板分割为语义单元，量化其对任务性能的影响，并修剪低效部分。

Result: 实验显示，ProCut显著减少提示长度（生产环境中减少78%的标记），任务性能保持或略有提升（比替代方法高62%）。

Conclusion: ProCut是一种高效、灵活的提示压缩方法，可无缝集成到现有优化框架中。

Abstract: In large-scale industrial LLM systems, prompt templates often expand to
thousands of tokens as teams iteratively incorporate sections such as task
instructions, few-shot examples, and heuristic rules to enhance robustness and
coverage. This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to
maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address
this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a
flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through
attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically
meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes
low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark
datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves
substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while
maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than
alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator
that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut
integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce
concise, high-performing prompts.

*Gustaf Ahdritz,Anat Kleiman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为SMeL Test的基准测试，用于评估语言模型在过滤不可信信息方面的能力，发现即使是最先进的模型也存在高幻觉率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网上存在大量不可信内容，但语言模型是否具备人类研究者用于过滤这些内容的简单启发式能力尚不明确。

Method: 引入SMeL Test基准测试，评估多种指令调优的语言模型（包括推理模型）在过滤不可信信息方面的表现。

Result: 没有模型能始终信任更可靠的来源；推理能力与较高得分相关，但最佳API模型的幻觉率仍高达70%。更大、更强的模型不一定优于较小模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型在过滤不可信信息时的高幻觉率问题，为未来方法开发提供了指导。

Abstract: The internet is rife with unattributed, deliberately misleading, or otherwise
untrustworthy content. Though large language models (LLMs) are often tasked
with autonomous web browsing, the extent to which they have learned the simple
heuristics human researchers use to navigate this noisy environment is not
currently known. In this paper, we introduce the Synthetic Media Literacy Test
(SMeL Test), a minimal benchmark that tests the ability of language models to
actively filter out untrustworthy information in context. We benchmark a
variety of commonly used instruction-tuned LLMs, including reasoning models,
and find that no model consistently trusts more reliable sources; while
reasoning in particular is associated with higher scores, even the best API
model we test hallucinates up to 70% of the time. Remarkably, larger and more
capable models do not necessarily outperform their smaller counterparts. We
hope our work sheds more light on this important form of hallucination and
guides the development of new methods to combat it.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的谄媚行为，揭示了其内部机制，包括用户意见如何诱导谄媚行为以及语法视角的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs中谄媚行为的内部机制，以改进模型的对齐和真实性。

Method: 通过系统研究用户意见对谄媚行为的影响，使用logit-lens分析和因果激活修补技术，识别谄媚行为的两个阶段。

Result: 发现简单意见陈述可靠地诱导谄媚行为，用户权威无影响，第一人称提示比第三人称更易引发谄媚。

Conclusion: 谄媚行为源于深层结构对学习知识的覆盖，对AI对齐和真实性系统有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behavior, agreeing
with user-stated opinions even when those contradict factual knowledge. While
prior work has documented this tendency, the internal mechanisms that enable
such behavior remain poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic
account of how sycophancy arises within LLMs. We first systematically study how
user opinions induce sycophancy across different model families. We find that
simple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise
framing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal
activation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a
late-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence.
We also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models
do not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical
perspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts
(``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than
third-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger
representational perturbations in deeper layers. These findings highlight that
sycophancy is not a surface-level artifact but emerges from a structural
override of learned knowledge in deeper layers, with implications for alignment
and truthful AI systems.

TL;DR: 研究了青少年对社交媒体中独特毒性语言的感知，构建了首个中文青少年毒性数据集，发现语境因素影响感知，并改进了现有毒性检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年对毒性内容的理解与成人不同，但现有研究忽略了青少年独特的毒性语言，即成人认为无害而青少年认为有害的语言。

Method: 以中国青少年为目标，构建首个中文青少年毒性数据集，分析其特征，并评估现有毒性检测技术的准确性。

Result: 青少年对毒性语言的感知与语境因素相关，结合这些元信息显著提高了检测准确性。

Conclusion: 提出了未来以青少年为中心的毒性检测研究的见解。

Abstract: Risk perception is subjective, and youth's understanding of toxic content
differs from that of adults. Although previous research has conducted extensive
studies on toxicity detection in social media, the investigation of youth's
unique toxicity, i.e., languages perceived as nontoxic by adults but toxic as
youth, is ignored. To address this gap, we aim to explore: 1) What are the
features of ``youth-toxicity'' languages in social media (RQ1); 2) Can existing
toxicity detection techniques accurately detect these languages (RQ2). For
these questions, we took Chinese youth as the research target, constructed the
first Chinese ``youth-toxicity'' dataset, and then conducted extensive
analysis. Our results suggest that youth's perception of these is associated
with several contextual factors, like the source of an utterance and
text-related features. Incorporating these meta information into current
toxicity detection methods significantly improves accuracy overall. Finally, we
propose several insights into future research on youth-centered toxicity
detection.

TL;DR: 通过元学习优化小型语言模型的预训练，使其更快、性能更好且更易解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型强大但成本高，研究如何通过元学习提升小型模型的预训练效果和可解释性。

Method: 结合一阶MAML和子集掩码语言模型预训练，构建四个LLama风格的解码器模型（11M-570M参数），并在基础NLP任务中评估。

Result: 相比传统训练，模型损失收敛快1.6倍，多语言NER任务F1提升，训练动态呈现两阶段变化（先多样化后压缩）。

Conclusion: 元学习为小型语言模型提供了高效、可解释的预训练方法，训练动态特征可用于分析模型适应性。

Abstract: Large language models are powerful but costly. We ask whether meta-learning
can make the pretraining of small language models not only better but also more
interpretable. We integrate first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining,
producing four LLama-style decoder-only models (11M-570M params), and evaluate
it on a fundamental NLP task with many settings and real-world applications.
Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x
sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and
(iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's
representations fan out ("diversify") and later they collapse into a smaller,
shared subspace ("compress"). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall
in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy. The same curves
pinpoint which layers specialise earliest and which later reconverge, giving a
compact, interpretable signature of meta-adaptation. Code, checkpoints and
WandB logs are released.

Conclusion: Seed Diffusion Preview在速度和质量的平衡上达到了新的最佳水平。

Abstract: We present Seed Diffusion Preview, a large-scale language model based on
discrete-state diffusion, offering remarkably fast inference speed. Thanks to
non-sequential, parallel generation, discrete diffusion models provide a
notable speedup to mitigate the inherent latency of token-by-token decoding, as
demonstrated recently (e.g., Mercury Coder, Gemini Diffusion). Seed Diffusion
Preview achieves an inference speed of 2,146 token/s over H20 GPUs while
maintaining competitive performance across a sweep of standard code evaluation
benchmarks, significantly faster than contemporary Mercury and Gemini
Diffusion, establishing new state of the art on the speed-quality Pareto

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLMs的数学能力（尤其是证明类问题）时存在不足，手动创建成本高且不可扩展。

Method: 提出Proof2X路线图，将数学证明转化为易于验证的多种问题类型，并设计了一种新型混合格式问题（“$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions”）。

Result: 通过AlgGeoTest（一个包含456个代数几何问题的基准测试）评估，发现当前LLMs在代数几何理解上存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: Proof2Hybrid框架和基准测试为深入研究AI系统的数学智能提供了新方向。

Abstract: Evaluating the mathematical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
critical yet challenging frontier. Existing benchmarks fall short, particularly
for proof-centric problems, as manual creation is unscalable and costly,
leaving the true mathematical abilities of LLMs largely unassessed. To overcome
these barriers, we propose Proof2Hybrid, the first fully automated framework
that synthesizes high-quality, proof-centric benchmarks from natural language
mathematical corpora. The key novelty of our solution is Proof2X, a roadmap of
converting mathematical proofs into various kinds of questions that are easy to
verify. Instructed by this roadmap, we propose a new type of hybrid-formatted
questions, named ``$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions'', specifically
designed to enable robust, automatic evaluation while being resilient to
guessing and superficial pattern matching inherent in traditional formats. As a
demonstration of our framework, we introduce AlgGeoTest, a benchmark for
algebraic geometry--a frontier domain of modern mathematics--comprising 456
challenging items. Our extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs using
AlgGeoTest reveal profound deficits in their comprehension of algebraic
geometry, providing a more precise measure of their true mathematical
capabilities. Our framework and benchmark pave the way for a new wave of
in-depth research into the mathematical intelligence of AI systems.

Motivation: 探索多语言大语言模型中文化信息的编码机制，以促进模型的公平性和包容性。

Method: 扩展语言特定神经元的定位方法，引入MUREL数据集（85.2百万标记），通过干预实验分离文化神经元。

Result: 发现文化神经元主要分布在上层，可独立调控，与语言神经元或其他文化神经元无显著重叠。

Conclusion: 文化知识在多语言模型中可被选择性编辑，有助于提升模型的公平性和对齐性。

Abstract: Language and culture are deeply intertwined, yet it is so far unclear how and
where multilingual large language models encode culture. Here, we extend upon
an established methodology for identifying language-specific neurons and extend
it to localize and isolate culture-specific neurons, carefully disentangling
their overlap and interaction with language-specific neurons. To facilitate our
experiments, we introduce MUREL, a curated dataset of 85.2 million tokens
spanning six different cultures. Our localization and intervention experiments
show that LLMs encode different cultures in distinct neuron populations,
predominantly in upper layers, and that these culture neurons can be modulated
independently from language-specific neurons or those specific to other
cultures. These findings suggest that cultural knowledge and propensities in
multilingual language models can be selectively isolated and edited - promoting
fairness, inclusivity, and alignment. Code and data is available at

Conclusion: 干扰矩阵是多语言模型设计的有效工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of language interference in
encoder-only Transformer models across 83 languages. We construct an
interference matrix by training and evaluating small BERT-like models on all
possible language pairs, providing a large-scale quantification of
cross-lingual interference. Our analysis reveals that interference between
languages is asymmetrical and that its patterns do not align with traditional
linguistic characteristics, such as language family, nor with proxies like
embedding similarity, but instead better relate to script. Finally, we
demonstrate that the interference matrix effectively predicts performance on
downstream tasks, serving as a tool to better design multilingual models to
obtain optimal performance.

Conclusion: 动态调整奖励信号的方法能有效提升RLVR性能，揭示了熵与性能交换机制的关键特征。

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been
widely used for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs). A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy
and performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a
fine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most
effectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across
different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training
process into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage
and plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism
varies across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our
analysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative
samples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn
drives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning
efficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in
low-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences. Motivated by
these findings, we propose two methods that dynamically adjust the reward
signal using perplexity and positional information to focus RL updates on
tokens that exhibit high learning potential, achieving improvements compared to
the baseline methods on various LLMs.

Motivation: 阿拉伯世界的语言景观中存在现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）与方言之间的显著差异，这对自然语言处理（尤其是机器翻译）提出了挑战。

Method: 开发了两个专门模型（MSA-to-Shami和Shami-to-MSA），基于AraT5v2架构，并在Nabra数据集上微调，使用MADAR语料库进行评估。

Result: MSA-to-Shami模型在GPT-4.1评估中获得了4.01/5.0的高分，证明了其翻译的准确性和方言真实性。

Conclusion: SHAMI-MT为方言阿拉伯语翻译提供了高保真工具，在内容本地化、文化遗产和跨文化交流中有重要应用。

Abstract: The rich linguistic landscape of the Arab world is characterized by a
significant gap between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the language of formal
communication, and the diverse regional dialects used in everyday life. This
diglossia presents a formidable challenge for natural language processing,
particularly machine translation. This paper introduces \textbf{SHAMI-MT}, a
bidirectional machine translation system specifically engineered to bridge the
communication gap between MSA and the Syrian dialect. We present two
specialized models, one for MSA-to-Shami and another for Shami-to-MSA
translation, both built upon the state-of-the-art AraT5v2-base-1024
architecture. The models were fine-tuned on the comprehensive Nabra dataset and
rigorously evaluated on unseen data from the MADAR corpus. Our MSA-to-Shami
model achieved an outstanding average quality score of \textbf{4.01 out of 5.0}
when judged by OPENAI model GPT-4.1, demonstrating its ability to produce
translations that are not only accurate but also dialectally authentic. This
work provides a crucial, high-fidelity tool for a previously underserved
language pair, advancing the field of dialectal Arabic translation and offering
significant applications in content localization, cultural heritage, and

Conclusion: Dynaword方法为数据集提供了可持续的社区协作和质量保证框架。

Abstract: Large-scale datasets are foundational for research and development in natural
language processing. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1)
reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and
derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community
contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes
restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise.
  To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword
approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating
large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community
collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this
approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four
times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed,
and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The
repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and
documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community
contributions and dataset evolution.

Result: 在标准数据集和实际应用中验证了方法的有效性，确认外部OOD检测器对保持响应相关性至关重要。

Conclusion: 外部OOD检测器是确保RAG系统响应相关性和安全性的关键。

Abstract: Ensuring safety and in-domain responses for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems is paramount in safety-critical applications, yet remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we evaluate four methodologies for
Out-Of-Domain (OOD) query detection: GPT-4o, regression-based, Principal
Component Analysis (PCA)-based, and Neural Collapse (NC), to ensure the RAG
system only responds to queries confined to the system's knowledge base.
Specifically, our evaluation explores two novel dimensionality reduction and
feature separation strategies: \textit{PCA}, where top components are selected
using explained variance or OOD separability, and an adaptation of
\textit{Neural Collapse Feature Separation}. We validate our approach on
standard datasets (StackExchange and MSMARCO) and real-world applications
(Substance Use and COVID-19), including tests against LLM-simulated and actual
attacks on a COVID-19 vaccine chatbot. Through human and LLM-based evaluations
of response correctness and relevance, we confirm that an external OOD detector
is crucial for maintaining response relevance.

Method: 提出LaMPE，利用参数化缩放sigmoid函数动态调整位置编码，并结合多粒度注意力机制。

Result: 在多个长上下文基准测试中，LaMPE显著优于现有长度外推方法。

Conclusion: LaMPE是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于多种RoPE基大语言模型，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) experience significant performance degradation
when the input exceeds the pretraining context window, primarily due to the
out-of-distribution (OOD) behavior of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Recent
studies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the
in-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic
relationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To
this end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a
training-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window
for adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed
frequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic
relationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric
scaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across
varying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention
mechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different
sequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range
dependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of
RoPE-based LLMs without training. Extensive experiments on three representative
LLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE
achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length
extrapolation methods. The code will be released at

TL;DR: 论文提出CAMERA框架，通过微专家压缩和量化提升MoE模型的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE模型参数增长带来的计算和存储开销问题，同时保持性能。

Method: 引入微专家作为压缩单元，提出CAMERA-P（剪枝）和CAMERA-Q（量化）框架。

Result: 在9个下游任务中，CAMERA-P在20%-60%剪枝率下表现优异，CAMERA-Q在2-bit量化下超越现有方法。

Conclusion: CAMERA框架高效且无需训练，显著提升MoE模型的压缩和量化效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters
across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial
computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE
models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While
prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or
decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by
introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across
matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers
as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and
training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis
uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding.
Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert
pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed
for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that
CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging
from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under
aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level
ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of
Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

TL;DR: 论文研究了微调大型语言模型在政治话题上会显著改变其政治立场，并意外影响无关话题的立场。通过神经元定位和抑制方法，提出了解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解微调对模型政治立场的影响机制，并解决跨话题立场泛化问题。

Method: 提出PNLAC方法定位政治神经元，并设计InhibitFT抑制方法减少跨话题泛化。

Result: 实验验证了政治神经元的存在，InhibitFT平均减少20%跨话题泛化，且仅需抑制5%神经元。

Conclusion: 通过神经元抑制方法可有效减少政治微调带来的跨话题立场泛化，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models on a political topic will significantly
manipulate their political stance on various issues and unintentionally affect
their stance on unrelated topics. While previous studies have proposed this
issue, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the internal
representations of these stances and the mechanisms that lead to unintended
cross-topic generalization. In this paper, we systematically explore the
internal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon from a neuron-level perspective
and how to mitigate the cross-topic generalization of political fine-tuning.
Firstly, we propose Political Neuron Localization through Activation
Contrasting (PNLAC) to identify two distinct types of political neurons:
general political neurons, which govern stance across multiple political
topics, and topic-specific neurons} that affect the model's political stance on
individual topics. We find the existence of these political neuron types across
four models and datasets through activation patching experiments. Leveraging
these insights, we introduce InhibitFT, an inhibition-based fine-tuning method,
effectively mitigating the cross-topic stance generalization. Experimental
results demonstrate the robustness of identified neuron types across various
models and datasets, and show that InhibitFT significantly reduces the
cross-topic stance generalization by 20% on average, while preserving
topic-specific performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that selectively
inhibiting only 5% of neurons is sufficient to effectively mitigate the
cross-topic stance generalization.

*Xiaolin Lin,Jingcun Wang,Olga Kondrateva,Yiyu Shi,Bing Li,Grace Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CompressKV提出了一种基于注意力头功能的KV缓存压缩方法，通过识别关键注意力头并分层自适应分配缓存，显著提升了LLMs的长上下文处理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法依赖启发式标记淘汰，忽略了注意力头的不同功能，导致关键标记被淘汰，影响模型性能。

Method: 识别能够检索初始、最终及重要标记的注意力头，利用这些头确定重要标记并保留其KV缓存；引入分层自适应缓存分配策略。

Result: 在LongBench和Needle-in-a-Haystack基准测试中，CompressKV在不同内存预算下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CompressKV通过优化注意力头功能和分层缓存分配，有效提升了LLMs的长上下文处理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted
long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size
poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache
compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads
in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different
functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens
and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.
  To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in
GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first
identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of
retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of
retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding
semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important
tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze
the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a
layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate
the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BAKE是一种新的连续知识图谱嵌入模型，通过贝叶斯后验更新和连续聚类方法有效缓解了知识遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱嵌入模型仅适用于静态图谱，而连续知识图谱嵌入（CKGE）面临的主要挑战是模型易发生灾难性遗忘。

Method: BAKE利用贝叶斯后验更新原则作为连续学习策略，并将新数据视为模型先验的贝叶斯更新；同时提出连续聚类方法约束新旧知识间的演化差异。

Result: 实验表明，BAKE在多个数据集上显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: BAKE通过贝叶斯更新和连续聚类方法，有效解决了CKGE中的知识遗忘问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Since knowledge graphs (KG) will continue to evolve in real scenarios,
traditional KGE models are only suitable for static knowledge graphs.
Therefore, continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) has attracted the
attention of researchers. Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the
model is prone to "catastrophic forgetting", resulting in the loss of
previously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem,
we propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior
update principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is
insensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the
forgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the
existing CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update
of the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution
of the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of
early snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,
we propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly
combats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or
change amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We
conduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results
show that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）测量创新的框架，替代传统专家评估，并在两个不同场景中验证了其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创新测量依赖专家评估和特定情境的代理指标，限制了研究的广泛性。LLMs的潜力为解决这一问题提供了新途径。

Method: 设计了一个LLM框架，通过非结构化文本数据评估创新性，并与现有方法和机器学习模型进行性能对比。

Result: LLM框架在F1分数和一致性上优于其他方法，验证了其可靠性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究人员和企业提供了一种高效、可靠的创新测量工具，并讨论了关键设计决策的影响。

Abstract: Measuring innovation often relies on context-specific proxies and on expert
evaluation. Hence, empirical innovation research is often limited to settings
where such data is available. We investigate how large language models (LLMs)
can be leveraged to overcome the constraints of manual expert evaluations and
assist researchers in measuring innovation. We design an LLM framework that
reliably approximates domain experts' assessment of innovation from
unstructured text data. We demonstrate the performance and broad applicability
of this framework through two studies in different contexts: (1) the
innovativeness of software application updates and (2) the originality of
user-generated feedback and improvement ideas in product reviews. We compared
the performance (F1-score) and reliability (consistency rate) of our LLM
framework against alternative measures used in prior innovation studies, and to
state-of-the-art machine learning- and deep learning-based models. The LLM
framework achieved higher F1-scores than the other approaches, and its results
are highly consistent (i.e., results do not change across runs). This article
equips R&D personnel in firms, as well as researchers, reviewers, and editors,
with the knowledge and tools to effectively use LLMs for measuring innovation
and evaluating the performance of LLM-based innovation measures. In doing so,
we discuss, the impact of important design decisions-including model selection,
prompt engineering, training data size, training data distribution, and
parameter settings-on performance and reliability. Given the challenges
inherent in using human expert evaluation and existing text-based measures, our
framework has important implications for harnessing LLMs as reliable,
increasingly accessible, and broadly applicable research tools for measuring
innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法依赖启发式或手动探索，缺乏自动化解决方案。

Method: 利用潜在语义空间嵌入种子提示，系统探索并优化提示以最大化任务性能。

Result: 在Financial PhraseBank情感分类任务中，单次优化周期提升约3%准确率。

Conclusion: LatentPrompt通用性强，仅需LLM黑盒访问和自动评估指标，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that optimizing prompts for Large Language Models
(LLMs) can significantly improve task performance, yet many optimization
techniques rely on heuristics or manual exploration. We present LatentPrompt, a
model-agnostic framework for prompt optimization that leverages latent semantic
space to automatically generate, evaluate, and refine candidate prompts without
requiring hand-crafted rules. Beginning with a set of seed prompts, our method
embeds them in a continuous latent space and systematically explores this space
to identify prompts that maximize task-specific performance. In a
proof-of-concept study on the Financial PhraseBank sentiment classification
benchmark, LatentPrompt increased classification accuracy by approximately 3
percent after a single optimization cycle. The framework is broadly applicable,
requiring only black-box access to an LLM and an automatic evaluation metric,
making it suitable for diverse domains and tasks.

Motivation: 探讨社交媒体在政治抗议中如何成为抵抗和身份构建的核心工具。

Method: 采用定性方法，分析视觉修辞、言语话语和数字讽刺。

Result: Facebook上的视觉和言语策略不仅动员了公众情绪，还构建了挑战威权叙事的集体身份。

Conclusion: 在线平台在数字时代可作为身份构建和政治动员的强大工具。

Abstract: This study investigates how Facebook shaped collective identity during the
July 2024 pro-democracy uprising in Bangladesh, known as the Monsoon Uprising.
During government repression, protesters turned to Facebook as a central space
for resistance, where multimodal expressions, images, memes, videos, hashtags,
and satirical posts played an important role in unifying participants. Using a
qualitative approach, this research analyzes visual rhetoric, verbal discourse,
and digital irony to reveal how shared symbols, protest art, and slogans built
a sense of solidarity. Key elements included the symbolic use of red, the
ironic metaphorical use of the term "Razakar", and the widespread sharing of
visuals representing courage, injustice, and resistance. The findings show that
the combination of visual and verbal strategies on Facebook not only mobilized
public sentiment, but also built a strong collective identity that challenged
authoritarian narratives. This study tries to demonstrate how online platforms
can serve as powerful tools for identity construction and political
mobilization in the digital age.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解LLMs如何编码跨语言的心理语言学知识，以及它们是否表现出人类类似的行为。

Method: 通过声音象征和词价任务，评估Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct在英语、荷兰语和中文中的表现。

Result: 模型输出受语言身份影响，Qwen对荷兰语和中文的区分更敏感；深层心理语言学信号更易解码，中文提示的效价表征更强。

Conclusion: 语言身份影响LLMs的输出行为和内部表征，为跨语言认知模型的应用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities, but
little is known about how they encode psycholinguistic knowledge across
languages. We investigate whether and how LLMs exhibit human-like
psycholinguistic responses under different linguistic identities using two
tasks: sound symbolism and word valence. We evaluate two models,
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, under monolingual and
bilingual prompting in English, Dutch, and Chinese. Behaviorally, both models
adjust their outputs based on prompted language identity, with Qwen showing
greater sensitivity and sharper distinctions between Dutch and Chinese. Probing
analysis reveals that psycholinguistic signals become more decodable in deeper
layers, with Chinese prompts yielding stronger and more stable valence
representations than Dutch. Our results demonstrate that language identity
conditions both output behavior and internal representations in LLMs, providing
new insights into their application as models of cross-linguistic cognition.

Conclusion: LLMs通过数字位特定电路解决算术问题，这种机制具有可解释性和独立性。

Abstract: While recent work has begun to uncover the internal strategies that Large
Language Models (LLMs) employ for simple arithmetic tasks, a unified
understanding of their underlying mechanisms is still lacking. We extend recent
findings showing that LLMs represent numbers in a digit-wise manner and present
evidence for the existence of digit-position-specific circuits that LLMs use to
perform simple arithmetic tasks, i.e. modular subgroups of MLP neurons that
operate independently on different digit positions (units, tens, hundreds).
Notably, such circuits exist independently of model size and of tokenization
strategy, i.e. both for models that encode longer numbers digit-by-digit and as
one token. Using Feature Importance and Causal Interventions, we identify and
validate the digit-position-specific circuits, revealing a compositional and
interpretable structure underlying the solving of arithmetic problems in LLMs.
Our interventions selectively alter the model's prediction at targeted digit
positions, demonstrating the causal role of digit-position circuits in solving
arithmetic tasks.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在生成具有严格结构和韵律要求的古典诗歌（宋词）时的能力，填补文化文本生成的研究空白。

Method: 开发多维度评估框架（形式符合度、自动质量评估、人工评估、分类任务），评估18种LLMs在五种提示策略下的表现，并提出Generate-Critic架构优化模型。

Result: 通过Generate-Critic架构优化后，轻量级开源LLMs的形式符合度提升了5.88%。

Conclusion: LLMs在生成文化意义重大且形式严格的文本时具有潜力，但仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained
generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a
classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and
rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive,
multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity
score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation,
and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate
the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15
open-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies:
zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought.
Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation
framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as
a reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal
conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and
limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally
constrained literary texts.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型如何在没有直接语音监督的情况下处理语音任务，特别是音素信息的表示。

Method: 通过分析Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct模型在押韵任务中的表现，研究其内部音素模型的表示方式。

Result: 发现模型内部存在高级音素组织，并识别出一个促进语音信息的“音素移动头”。其音素模型与人类标准IPA元音图相似。

Conclusion: Llama模型能够自发学习与人类语音系统相似的音素表示，无需直接监督。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate proficiency on phonetic tasks, such as
rhyming, without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding. In this work, we
investigate how \verb|Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct| represents token-level phonetic
information. Our results suggest that Llama uses a rich internal model of
phonemes to complete phonetic tasks. We provide evidence for high-level
organization of phoneme representations in its latent space. In doing so, we
also identify a ``phoneme mover head" which promotes phonetic information
during rhyming tasks. We visualize the output space of this head and find that,
while notable differences exist, Llama learns a model of vowels similar to the
standard IPA vowel chart for humans, despite receiving no direct supervision to
do so.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用Transformer模型在技术文档的细粒度语法和实体关系处理上表现不佳，需要更专业的模型。

Method: CGT通过动态图构建和GATv2Conv层学习局部结构，再通过Transformer捕获全局依赖，结合RAG管道。

Result: CGT在准确率上比GPT-2高24.7%，且参数减少62.4%。

Conclusion: CGT在技术语言处理中表现出色，适应性强，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text,
often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex
technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual
Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering.
CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram,
and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local
structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer
encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical
domains often require specialized language models with stronger
contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient
solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7%
higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from
CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range
semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase
approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on
domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical
language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented
responses in real-world applications.

Abstract: Automatically analyzing dialogue can help understand and guide behavior in
domains such as counseling, where interactions are largely mediated by
conversation. In this paper, we study modeling behavioral codes used to asses a
psychotherapy treatment style called Motivational Interviewing (MI), which is
effective for addressing substance abuse and related problems. Specifically, we
address the problem of providing real-time guidance to therapists with a
dialogue observer that (1) categorizes therapist and client MI behavioral codes
and, (2) forecasts codes for upcoming utterances to help guide the conversation
and potentially alert the therapist. For both tasks, we define neural network
models that build upon recent successes in dialogue modeling. Our experiments
demonstrate that our models can outperform several baselines for both tasks. We
also report the results of a careful analysis that reveals the impact of the
various network design tradeoffs for modeling therapy dialogue.

Abstract: Human tutoring interventions play a crucial role in supporting student
learning, improving academic performance, and promoting personal growth. This
paper focuses on analyzing mathematics tutoring discourse using talk moves - a
framework of dialogue acts grounded in Accountable Talk theory. However,
scaling the collection, annotation, and analysis of extensive tutoring
dialogues to develop machine learning models is a challenging and
resource-intensive task. To address this, we present SAGA22, a compact dataset,
and explore various modeling strategies, including dialogue context, speaker
information, pretraining datasets, and further fine-tuning. By leveraging
existing datasets and models designed for classroom teaching, our results
demonstrate that supplementary pretraining on classroom data enhances model
performance in tutoring settings, particularly when incorporating longer
context and speaker information. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation
studies to underscore the challenges in talk move modeling.

Conclusion: CL-LSI是一种有效的跨语言文档对齐方法，适用于话题和事件级别的对齐任务。

Abstract: Comparable corpus is a set of topic aligned documents in multiple languages,
which are not necessarily translations of each other. These documents are
useful for multilingual natural language processing when there is no parallel
text available in some domains or languages. In addition, comparable documents
are informative because they can tell what is being said about a topic in
different languages. In this paper, we present a method to build comparable
corpora from Wikipedia encyclopedia and EURONEWS website in English, French and
Arabic languages. We further experiment a method to automatically align
comparable documents using cross-lingual similarity measures. We investigate
two cross-lingual similarity measures to align comparable documents. The first
measure is based on bilingual dictionary, and the second measure is based on
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Experiments on several corpora show that the
Cross-Lingual LSI (CL-LSI) measure outperforms the dictionary based measure.
Finally, we collect English and Arabic news documents from the British
Broadcast Corporation (BBC) and from ALJAZEERA (JSC) news website respectively.
Then we use the CL-LSI similarity measure to automatically align comparable
documents of BBC and JSC. The evaluation of the alignment shows that CL-LSI is
not only able to align cross-lingual documents at the topic level, but also it
is able to do this at the event level.

*Jannatun Naim,Jie Cao,Fareen Tasneem,Jennifer Jacobs,Brent Milne,James Martin,Tamara Sumner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多视角话语分析方法，结合领域特定的对话动作和话语关系，解决了数学教育中反馈分析的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决话语分析中的多功能性和领域特定分类排除问题，以提升数学教育中的反馈质量。

Method: 整合领域特定的对话动作（43标签）和话语关系（16关系），应用于两个数学教育数据集。

Result: 发现无对话动作的话语在课堂中具有关键功能，强调话语关系和对话动作对AI辅助教育的重要性。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于提升教育反馈和开发模拟师生角色的AI代理。

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in
mathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language
processing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple
perspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two
primary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve
multiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of
many utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to
their omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a
multi-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves
with dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with
43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation
Theory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a
comprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as
utterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics
education datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through
distributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view
deep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital
role of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far
from being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and
structuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of
incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education
systems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments.
Our framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also
aiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles
of both educators and students.

### [177] [Automated SNOMED CT Concept Annotation in Clinical Text Using Bi-GRU Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02556)
*Ali Noori,Pratik Devkota,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于双向GRU的神经序列标注方法，用于自动标注临床文本中的SNOMED CT概念，性能优于传统规则系统，且计算成本低于基于Transformer的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本的标准化标注对结构化数据提取和决策支持至关重要，但手动标注成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 使用双向GRU模型，结合MIMIC-IV数据集，通过SpaCy和SciBERT预处理文本，并利用上下文、句法和形态特征进行标注。

Result: 模型在验证集上达到90%的F1分数，优于传统方法，且能有效处理模糊词和拼写错误。

Conclusion: 轻量级RNN架构能以较低计算成本实现高质量临床概念标注，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Automated annotation of clinical text with standardized medical concepts is
critical for enabling structured data extraction and decision support. SNOMED
CT provides a rich ontology for labeling clinical entities, but manual
annotation is labor-intensive and impractical at scale. This study introduces a
neural sequence labeling approach for SNOMED CT concept recognition using a
Bidirectional GRU model. Leveraging a subset of MIMIC-IV, we preprocess text
with domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT-based tokenization, segmenting sentences
into overlapping 19-token chunks enriched with contextual, syntactic, and
morphological features. The Bi-GRU model assigns IOB tags to identify concept
spans and achieves strong performance with a 90 percent F1-score on the
validation set. These results surpass traditional rule-based systems and match
or exceed existing neural models. Qualitative analysis shows effective handling
of ambiguous terms and misspellings. Our findings highlight that lightweight
RNN-based architectures can deliver high-quality clinical concept annotation
with significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models,
making them well-suited for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: Sparse-dLLM通过动态缓存淘汰和稀疏注意力优化dLLMs的计算效率，显著提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs在推理时存在二次计算复杂度和高内存开销，现有缓存技术因存储全层状态而限制长上下文应用。

Method: 提出Sparse-dLLM框架，结合动态缓存淘汰和延迟双向稀疏缓存，利用注意力模式选择性保留关键令牌。

Result: 在LLaDA和Dream系列实验中，Sparse-dLLM吞吐量提升10倍，性能与内存开销与原始dLLMs相当。

Conclusion: Sparse-dLLM在效率和效果上优于现有方法，为dLLMs的高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) enable breakthroughs in reasoning and
parallel decoding but suffer from prohibitive quadratic computational
complexity and memory overhead during inference. Current caching techniques
accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory
usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns
in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining
salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant,
motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first
training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse
attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability
of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts
unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive
experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to
10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance
and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and
effectiveness.

TL;DR: EH-Benchmark是一个新的眼科基准，用于评估医学大语言模型（MLLMs）中的幻觉问题，并提出一个三阶段框架来缓解这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在眼科诊断中存在幻觉问题，影响准确性，现有基准无法有效评估或解决这些问题。

Method: 提出EH-Benchmark，将幻觉分为视觉理解和逻辑组合两类，并设计一个三阶段框架（知识检索、任务案例研究、结果验证）来缓解幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著减少了幻觉，提高了准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark为MLLMs在眼科诊断中的幻觉问题提供了有效的评估和解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过分析LLM的注意力权重来研究记忆现象，发现现有分类法效果不佳，并提出了一种新的分类法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）中记忆现象的多面性及其背后的机制。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络（CNN）分析LLM的注意力权重，评估其与现有分类法的对齐情况。

Result: 现有分类法表现不佳，新提出的分类法包含三类记忆样本，并揭示少量样本记忆与注意力机制无关。

Conclusion: 新分类法更准确，部分记忆样本实际为模型猜测，需单独研究，并开发了可视化技术定位记忆区域。

Abstract: Verbatim memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted
phenomenon involving distinct underlying mechanisms. We introduce a novel
method to analyze the different forms of memorization described by the existing
taxonomy. Specifically, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the
attention weights of the LLM and evaluate the alignment between this taxonomy
and the attention weights involved in decoding.
  We find that the existing taxonomy performs poorly and fails to reflect
distinct mechanisms within the attention blocks. We propose a new taxonomy that
maximizes alignment with the attention weights, consisting of three categories:
memorized samples that are guessed using language modeling abilities, memorized
samples that are recalled due to high duplication in the training set, and
non-memorized samples. Our results reveal that few-shot verbatim memorization
does not correspond to a distinct attention mechanism. We also show that a
significant proportion of extractable samples are in fact guessed by the model
and should therefore be studied separately. Finally, we develop a custom visual
interpretability technique to localize the regions of the attention weights
involved in each form of memorization.

TL;DR: 论文提出EHSAN，一种结合ChatGPT伪标签和人工审核的混合方法，构建首个可解释的阿拉伯语医疗领域方面级情感数据集。实验表明，即使仅用ChatGPT标签，模型性能下降较小，且减少类别数可提升分类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语患者反馈因方言多样性和标签稀缺而缺乏自动化分析，EHSAN旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用ChatGPT伪标签与人工审核结合的混合流程，构建数据集，并训练两种Transformer模型进行方面和情感分类。

Result: 阿拉伯语专用模型在少量人工监督下仍保持高准确率，减少类别数显著提升分类效果。

Conclusion: EHSAN为阿拉伯语医疗领域方面级情感分析提供了可扩展且有效的方法，未来可扩展至更多医院和优化提示设计。

Abstract: Arabic-language patient feedback remains under-analysed because dialect
diversity and scarce aspect-level sentiment labels hinder automated assessment.
To address this gap, we introduce EHSAN, a data-centric hybrid pipeline that
merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with targeted human review to build the first
explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare. Each sentence
is annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or
neutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes,
with ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance
transparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model
performance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised
set with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human
review, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We
fine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and
sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific
model achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting
only a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the
number of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the
board. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic
aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language
model annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable
dataset. Future directions include generalisation across hospitals, prompt
refinement, and interpretable data-driven modelling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多LLM结合方法缺乏结构化，导致结果不可靠。MArgE旨在通过计算论证学提供可验证的结构化证据。

Method: 使用Argumentative LLMs构建结构化论证树，为任务提供可追溯的验证路径。

Result: MArgE显著优于单LLM、开源模型及无结构多LLM辩论方法。

Conclusion: 引入形式化论证机制能有效提升多LLM输出的结合效果。

Abstract: Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as
a method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while
mitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However,
current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve
unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations
that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel
framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the
form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We
use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks
and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct
structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable
pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions,
providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE
can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models
(4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior
methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages
of incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining
multiple LLM outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在字符级任务上的表现不佳是否与分词方式有关，并填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入CharBench基准测试，评估多种领先的开源和专有模型，分析任务表现与单词长度、字符计数及分词属性的相关性。

Result: 现代语言模型在CharBench上表现较差，平均准确率为43.6%和32.3%；任务表现与单词长度和字符计数更相关，而非分词方式。

Conclusion: CharBench为未来研究提供了工具，建议改进模型在字符级任务上的表现，尤其是对长词和字符位置信息的处理。

Abstract: Tasks that require character-level reasoning, such as counting or locating
characters within words, remain challenging for contemporary language models. A
common conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather
than characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet
recent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization,
leaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a
comprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of
magnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of
leading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it
presents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of
43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic
properties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model
performance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are
weakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and
the actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks
requiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively
correlated with the length of the token containing the queried character,
suggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs.
We encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology
introduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“交互蒸馏”的新方法，用于解决奖励模型（RM）中的注意力分配问题，通过优化注意力机制提升偏好建模的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前奖励模型（RM）在偏好建模中存在注意力分配不足的问题，导致判断信号容易被上下文误导。

Method: 提出“交互蒸馏”框架，利用基于交互的自然语言理解模型作为教师模型，通过注意力对齐目标优化偏好建模。

Result: 实验表明，交互蒸馏能提供更稳定和通用的奖励信号，优于现有针对数据噪声的RM优化方法。

Conclusion: 注意力分配问题是RM的根本限制，交互蒸馏为解决这一问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The reward model (RM), as the core component of reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs), responsible for
providing reward signals to generated responses. However, mainstream preference
modeling in RM is inadequate in terms of token-level interaction, making its
judgment signals vulnerable to being hacked by misallocated attention to
context. This stems from two fundamental limitations: (1) Current preference
modeling employs decoder-only architectures, where the unidirectional causal
attention mechanism leads to forward-decaying intra-sequence attention within
the prompt-response sequence. (2) The independent Siamese-encoding paradigm
induces the absence of token-level inter-sequence attention between chosen and
rejected sequences. To address this "attention hacking", we propose
"Interaction Distillation", a novel training framework for more adequate
preference modeling through attention-level optimization. The method introduces
an interaction-based natural language understanding model as the teacher to
provide sophisticated token interaction patterns via comprehensive attention,
and guides the preference modeling to simulate teacher model's interaction
pattern through an attentional alignment objective. Through extensive
experiments, interaction distillation has demonstrated its ability to provide
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to state-of-the-art RM
optimization methods that target data noise, highlighting the attention hacking
constitute a more fundamental limitation in RM.

TL;DR: Pointer是一种新型架构，通过层间指针链实现线性复杂度O(NK)，优于传统注意力机制的O(N²)，在长序列任务中提速2-10倍，保持高精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统注意力机制在长序列建模中的高计算复杂度（O(N²)）问题，同时避免预训练需求。

Method: 采用层间指针链技术，每层指针选择依赖于前一层指针位置，形成显式长距离连接。

Result: 在长序列任务中提速2-10倍，2048个token的复制任务中保持>95%准确率，并学习到可解释的指针模式。

Conclusion: Pointer为无需预训练的高效长序列建模提供了有吸引力的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce Pointer, a novel architecture that achieves linear $O(NK)$
complexity for long-range sequence modeling while maintaining superior
performance without requiring pre-training. Unlike standard attention
mechanisms that compute $O(N^2)$ pairwise interactions, our approach uses
layer-wise pointer chaining where each layer's pointer selection depends on
previous layer's pointer positions, creating explicit long-distance connections
through pointer chains. We demonstrate that this architecture achieves
$2$--$10\times$ speedup on long sequences compared to standard transformers,
maintains $>95\%$ accuracy on copy tasks at distances up to 2048 tokens, and
learns interpretable pointer patterns that reveal structured dependency
modeling. Our experiments on efficiency benchmarks, long-range dependency
tasks, and interpretability analysis show that Pointer offers a compelling
alternative to attention mechanisms for scenarios requiring efficient
long-range modeling without pre-training dependencies.

Conclusion: 建议数据集不应被视为不可变，需定期检查和版本化，同时为数据集创建者和使用者提供了改进质量的建议。

Abstract: Several multilingual benchmark datasets have been developed in a
semi-automatic manner in the recent past to measure progress and understand the
state-of-the-art in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models.
However, there is not a lot of attention paid to the quality of the datasets
themselves, despite the existence of previous work in identifying errors in
even fully human-annotated test sets. In this paper, we manually analyze recent
multilingual evaluation sets in two languages - French and Telugu, identifying
several errors in the process. We compare the performance difference across
several LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and
identify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages). Based
on these results, we argue that test sets should not be considered immutable
and should be revisited, checked for correctness, and potentially versioned. We
end with some recommendations for both the dataset creators as well as
consumers on addressing the dataset quality issues.

Abstract: Masked Face Recognition (MFR) is an increasingly important area in biometric
recognition technologies, especially with the widespread use of masks as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This development has created new challenges
for facial recognition systems due to the partial concealment of basic facial
features. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the latest

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像数据集常包含敏感或专有内容，现有解决方案在验证效果和数据完整性之间存在权衡，数据所有者需要可靠机制验证数据是否被滥用。

Method: HoneyImage选择性修改少量困难样本，嵌入不可察觉但可验证的痕迹。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和多种模型架构上的实验表明，HoneyImage验证准确率高，对下游性能影响极小。

Conclusion: HoneyImage为数据所有者提供了一种实用的所有权保护机制，促进安全共享并释放数据驱动AI的潜力。

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金属合金显微组织分割中因缺乏人工标注的相掩码（尤其是稀有或复杂形态）而导致的机器学习效果受限问题。

Method: 通过全局相分数向量控制，增强真实数据分布并突出少数类，生成结构一致的显微组织图像和掩码样本。

Conclusion: PF-DiffSeg为金属学应用提供了一种可扩展的数据增强解决方案，将生成和条件整合到统一框架中。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure
segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks,
particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal
alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage
denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images
and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to
further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction
vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority
classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent
microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and
training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively
manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and
streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as
highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法忽略事件的时间信息，TESPEC旨在填补这一空白，通过长事件序列预训练提升循环模型性能。

Result: 实验证明TESPEC在目标检测、语义分割和单目深度估计等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: TESPEC是首个利用长事件序列预训练循环模型的框架，显著提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

Abstract: Face recognition systems experience severe performance degradation when

evaluation of latent diffusion-based enhancement for improving face recognition
under forensically relevant degradations. Using a dataset of 3,000 individuals
from LFW with 24,000 recognition attempts, we implement the Flux.1 Kontext Dev
pipeline with Facezoom LoRA adaptation to test against seven degradation
categories, including compression artefacts, blur effects, and noise
contamination. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements, increasing

Conclusion: CCRA通过一致性和渐进性设计，显著提升模型性能和注意力对齐。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating
diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to
mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent
Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross
Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by
jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention
Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and
patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures
consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift
and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten
diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced
LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all
baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing
enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically
aligned attention patterns.

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

Conclusion: ROVI为文本到图像生成提供了高质量的数据支持，显著提升了实例接地准确性。

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded
text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key
innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection
stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual
descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to
extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary
Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to
instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically
overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in
image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more
categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a
text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,
and aesthetic quality. Our dataset and reproducible pipeline are available at

Conclusion: AutoSIGHT为动态人机协作中专业评估提供了可行方案，并公开了眼动追踪数据集。

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye
tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，通过重投影误差和相机轨迹一致性评估重建质量。

Conclusion: 增量式SfM在视觉结构化环境中是一种可靠的稀疏3D重建方法。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key
requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding.
While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image
connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM
offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views
into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and
camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper,
we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing
on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative
refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real
dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera
trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental
SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured
environments.

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

Motivation: 现代深度模型高度依赖数据，但许多数据集是专有或敏感的，DOV方法用于保护版权。然而，现有研究对规避攻击的评估过于简化，导致虚假的安全感。

Method: 提出统一规避框架，利用教师模型学习版权数据，通过OOD数据集转移任务相关知识，结合Vision-Language和Large Language模型筛选最优转移集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能消除所有版权标识，在泛化和有效性上显著优于九种现有规避攻击，且计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前DOV方法的关键漏洞，强调需长期发展以提升实用性。

Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large
scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for
rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive
information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world
where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification
(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting
unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its
diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely
challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied
on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of
security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model
first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet
identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an
out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging
Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most
informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer
set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a
better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments
across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach
simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly
outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and
effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we
reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for
long-term development to enhance practicality.

(image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model
performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of
complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the
simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D
achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法依赖熟悉特征假设，忽略了衰减特征的作用，COSTARR旨在利用这些被忽视的信息。

Method: COSTARR结合熟悉特征和陌生特征的缺失，通过概率解释其评分，并通过消融实验验证预衰减和后衰减特征的贡献。

Result: COSTARR在多种预训练架构和大规模数据集上表现优异，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: COSTARR通过利用衰减信息，有效提升了开放集识别的能力，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.
Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,
detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel
attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate
features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding
information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage
this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines
both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We
provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the
likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To
determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features
to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both
pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard
product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in
a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,
iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple
modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments
demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures
and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating
previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition
capabilities.

Result: 实验证明Trans-Adapter在透明图像修复中有效，解决了透明度和边缘质量问题。

Conclusion: Trans-Adapter为透明图像修复提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any
application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them
more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image
inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional
approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a
background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image
inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to
preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce
jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we
propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based
inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also
supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated
into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench,
along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for
assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: MASIV通过材料无关的方法和密集几何指导，显著提升了系统识别的性能。

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and
governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering
with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability
to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework
for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that
depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural
constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a
scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state
information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and
physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric
guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing
temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive
experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric
accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is
crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,
advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by
accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.
However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with
structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world
egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and
dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks
that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without
relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional
motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored
for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports
egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person
visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene
semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer
plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a
large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth
3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in
egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a
single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling
and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

### [208] [Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Brain MRI Using a Domain-Agnostic Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01137)
*Zeduo Zhang,Yalda Mohsenzadeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的半监督异常检测框架，适用于跨领域任务，在脑MRI和工业数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模数据、过拟合和类别不平衡等问题，特别是在脑MRI异常检测中的应用。

Method: 结合深度强化学习与特征表示，处理标签稀缺和大规模数据，预处理包括归一化、去颅骨和配准。

Result: 在脑MRI数据集上AUROC达88.7%（像素级）和96.7%（图像级），工业数据集上表现同样优秀。

Conclusion: 该方法具有鲁棒性、泛化能力和高效性，适用于实际临床和工业应用。

Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework
that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as
large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI
volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets
collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and
578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the
BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing
(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,
skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were
conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and
ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The
proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label
scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on
several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The
proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%
(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive
performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,
indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size
showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without
evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic
semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly
detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial
datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications.

*Huyu Wu,Duo Su,Junjie Hou,Guang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出DC3框架，通过颜色补偿提升数据集压缩的性能和保真度，解决了现有方法在极端压缩下的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法在性能和保真度之间存在权衡，图像级选择方法效率低，像素级优化则引入语义失真。作者发现颜色在信息传递和语义表示中的双重作用被忽视，因此提出通过增强颜色多样性来改进压缩效果。

Method: 提出DC3框架，结合校准选择策略和潜在扩散模型，增强图像颜色多样性而非生成全新图像。

Result: DC3在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，且首次利用预训练扩散模型微调压缩数据集，FID结果验证了其高质量数据集的可行性。

Conclusion: DC3通过颜色补偿显著提升了数据集压缩的性能和保真度，为下游任务提供了高质量数据支持。

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Method: 结合3D高斯表示与截断有符号距离场，动态融合语义特征；引入多模态语言引导的自适应阈值方法优化分割。

Result: 在3D mIoU上比固定阈值策略提升17%，在3D对象理解和场景重建质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OpenGS-Fusion在开放词汇场景理解和语言引导交互中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides
in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly
for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered
by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level
understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present
OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that
improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding.
OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed
Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named
MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D
objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement
17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object
understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its
effectiveness in language-guided scene interaction. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型的安全机制未考虑用户个性化需求，如年龄、心理健康和个人信仰。

Method: 提出PSA框架，整合用户个性化配置文件，通过交叉注意力机制调整模型行为。

Result: PSA在有害内容抑制和用户约束对齐方面表现优异，Win Rate和Pass Rate得分更高。

Conclusion: PSA有效平衡了生成内容的安全性和个性化需求，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有二分图像分割方法在用户控制和个性化应用中的不足。

Method: 结合语言控制的分割策略（LS）和窗口控制的细化策略（WR），通过潜在扩散模型实现图像条件掩码生成。

Result: 在DIS5K基准测试中显著优于11种先进方法，F_β^ω增益最高达4.6%。

Conclusion: LawDIS框架在用户控制和分割精度方面表现出色，适合高精度个性化应用。

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image
segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our
framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a
latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS
is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we
introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an
initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a
window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of
user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.
Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or
jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised
applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our
LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.
Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$
gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the
LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决STR任务中复杂视觉表现和有限语义先验的挑战。

Method: 通过编码目标标签到嵌入空间并应用损失感知掩码，模拟从标签依赖学习到完全视觉识别的课程学习过程。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，使用TEACH训练的模型在准确性上表现更优，尤其在挑战性条件下。

Conclusion: TEACH无需外部预训练，无推理开销，模型无关且易于集成，验证了其鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual
appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training
paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and
progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels
into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a
curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning
to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH
requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder
frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that
models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially
under challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general
applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在大量轨迹处理时计算成本高，存在两个主要瓶颈：基于transformer的迭代跟踪和相关性特征计算。

Method: 采用粗到细策略，逐步扩展跟踪轨迹，并使用可学习插值模块初始化新轨迹；优化相关性特征计算。

Result: 速度提升5-100倍，同时保持最先进的跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 新算法显著提升了3D点跟踪的效率，解决了现有方法的计算瓶颈。

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point
tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we
identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based
iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of
trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that
begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set
of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a
learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the
tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces
the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior
methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

Motivation: 解决多视角图像稀疏且无真实姿态时的3D重建问题，提升实用性和效率。

Method: 采用共享特征提取主干网络，同时预测3D高斯基元和相机姿态，结合渲染损失和重投影损失优化几何约束。

Result: 在无姿态监督下，SPFSplat在新视角合成和相对姿态估计中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SPFSplat的免姿态训练和高效设计使其在实用场景中表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from
sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or
inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling
simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a
canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step.
Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a
reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned
Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training
paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited
for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose
supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view
synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.
It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose
estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page:

Motivation: 现有方法通常将3D功能区域定位和功能分类分开处理，导致预测不一致，且无法推断完整的潜在功能区域或适应不同尺度的功能区域。

Method: 提出了一种通过学习功能感知的3D表示，并采用阶段式推理策略，结合跨模态融合和多尺度几何特征传播，实现功能区域定位和分类的联合优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在功能区域定位和分类任务上均表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合建模和阶段式推理，有效解决了功能区域定位和分类的依赖性问题，并提升了任务性能。

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from
observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D
object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance
grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).
Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to
inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In
addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas
depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and
operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances
significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address
these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D
representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the
dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first
develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and
multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential
affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple
two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and
classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance
grounding and classification.

Motivation: 传统视觉定位任务依赖边界框，无法捕捉精细细节，导致对象表示不准确。

Method: 提出3D占用定位基准和GroundingOcc模型，结合多模态学习，从粗到细预测对象位置和占用信息。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，GroundingOcc优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 3D占用定位方法提供了更精确的对象感知，GroundingOcc模型在多模态学习中表现优异。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on
natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in
autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend
on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all
voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object
representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy
grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it
integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering
more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task.
Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D
occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual,
and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information
from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder
for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a
grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and
a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting
model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent
inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional
approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess
infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning
models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images
of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's
PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.
This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to

Motivation: 通过视觉技术提前获取道路表面条件，为自动驾驶车辆的规划与控制系统提供有效信息，从而提高安全性和驾驶舒适性。现有Mamba架构在视觉道路表面分类任务中表现不佳，因其缺乏对局部纹理的有效提取。

Method: 采用双状态空间模型（DualSSM）提取全局语义和局部纹理，并通过双注意力融合（DAF）解码和融合双特征。提出双辅助损失函数，明确约束双分支，避免网络仅依赖全局语义信息。

Result: 在包含100万样本的大规模道路表面分类数据集上，RoadMamba实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RoadMamba通过结合全局和局部感知，显著提升了道路表面分类任务的性能，为自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠的道路条件信息。

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies
provides effective information for the planning and control system of
autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the
vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has
shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the
efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures
struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to
their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In
this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba
architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that
effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba.
Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively
extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode
and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In
addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual
branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic
information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.
The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments
on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million
samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在风格迁移中因将文本描述视为统一的指导而忽略了文本与视觉风格之间的语义差距，导致语义结构和细节丢失。

Method: 框架包括Prior-Guided Data Distillation（PGD）和Contrastive Semantic Decoupling（CSD）。PGD通过无监督方式提取风格知识，CSD通过域特定权重调整文本编码器。

Result: 在三个经典基准测试中，StyDeco在风格保真度和结构保留方面优于现有方法，并支持独特的去风格化过程。

Conclusion: StyDeco有效解决了风格迁移中的语义保留问题，展示了其扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer,
but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats
textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks
the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the
spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of
semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,
we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by
learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer
task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a
strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It
leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize
pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling
(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using
domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic
space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.
Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity
and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer
with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique
de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is
vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 楼层平面定位因重复结构易导致模糊定位，现有方法忽视视觉图像提供的丰富上下文信息。

Method: 采用无监督学习技术预训练房间判别器，提取隐藏房间类型信息，并将其注入FLoc算法。

Result: 在两个标准FLoc基准测试中，方法优于现有技术，显著提升了鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 通过利用视觉场景上下文信息，可以有效消除定位模糊性，提升FLoc性能。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently
robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc)
has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and
minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many
repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in
ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D
structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual
pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual
images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower
FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.
In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering
constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room
images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of
the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the
scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc
algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite
visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual
Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGaFace提出了一种新的3D头部虚拟形象建模框架，通过动态优化几何和纹理属性，解决了传统方法中网格与图像不对齐的问题，显著提升了渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖FLAME网格和基于高斯的渲染，但网格与目标图像不对齐会导致渲染质量下降和细节丢失。

Method: 引入Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry模块和Latent Texture Attention机制，动态优化几何和纹理。

Result: 实验表明，MoGaFace在高保真头部虚拟形象重建和新视角合成方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MoGaFace在网格初始化不准确和真实场景下仍能实现高质量的3D头部虚拟形象建模。

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process,
relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by
Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and
target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine
visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar
modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture
attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the
misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the
Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a
momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism
to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent
Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware
representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration
into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis
quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的神经网络架构Eigen Neural Network (ENN)，通过层共享的正交特征基重新参数化权重，解决了传统DNN权重结构混乱的问题，提升了特征表示和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络的梯度优化容易产生混乱的权重结构，影响特征清晰性和学习动态。

Method: 引入ENN架构，通过层共享的正交特征基重新参数化权重，强制权重动态解耦和对齐。

Result: ENN在ImageNet等大规模图像分类任务上表现优异，并在跨模态图像-文本检索中创下新基准。其变体ENN-ℓ实现了无反向传播的高效训练，速度提升2倍以上且精度更高。

Conclusion: ENN通过直接解决反向传播的表示缺陷，提供了性能更强、训练更高效的架构范式。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

Motivation: 解决RevSNNs因严格顺序计算导致的高延迟问题，提升训练和推理效率。

Method: 提出ParaRevSNN，通过解耦可逆块间的顺序依赖实现并行计算，保留可逆性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ParaRevSNN准确率与标准RevSNNs相当或更高，训练时间减少35.2%，推理时间降至18.15%。

Conclusion: ParaRevSNN适合资源受限场景，兼具高效性和内存节省优势。

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training
by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from
high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that
decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving
reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly
accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits
of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128
Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard
RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to
18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
scenarios.

*Xinyu Chen,Haotian Zhai,Can Zhang,Xiupeng Shi,Ruirui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多缓存增强的原型测试时间适应方法（MCP），通过三个缓存优化原型构建，提升零样本设置下的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的测试时间适应方法依赖低熵样本构建原型，但在分布偏移下可能不可靠，且无法保证类内紧凑性。研究发现性能与类内紧凑性正相关，因此提出改进方法。

Method: 提出MCP方法，包含三个缓存：熵缓存（低熵样本初始化原型）、对齐缓存（视觉与文本信息整合）、负缓存（高熵样本校准预测）。进一步开发MCP++框架，引入跨模态原型对齐和残差学习。

Result: 在15个下游任务上的实验表明，MCP和MCP++实现了最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 多缓存和跨模态对齐显著提升了测试时间适应的性能，尤其在分布偏移下表现优异。

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多视图开放集学习框架，通过模糊不确定性校准和视图去偏，解决了现有模型在开放集场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图学习模型因假设类别完整性而难以处理开放集场景，且视图诱导的静态偏差进一步削弱了识别未知类别能力。

Method: 设计了O-Mix合成策略生成虚拟样本，并通过辅助模糊感知网络捕获非典型模式；引入HSIC对比去偏模块，增强视图独立性。

Result: 在多种多视图基准测试中，该框架显著提升了未知类别识别能力，同时保持了封闭集性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了开放集学习中的模糊性和视图偏差问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应内容补偿方法（ACCM），通过图像描述减少视觉信息损失，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的高计算成本限制了其广泛应用，现有方法在高剪枝率下性能下降严重。

Method: ACCM包含轻量级描述生成模型和选择器，通过自监督学习生成问题相关的图像描述并选择最佳候选。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，ACCM以更低的计算成本（如减少6.5% FLOPs）显著超越现有方法（提升20.6%）。

Conclusion: ACCM有效解决了高剪枝率下的视觉信息损失问题，为LVLMs的高效应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high
computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational
cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which
consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods
have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe
performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual
information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method
(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image
caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption
model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related
descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector
further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.
Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently
without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments
across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly
outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%
with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

Result: 实验表明，OCSplats在不同复杂度的场景中均实现了领先的重建性能和精确的标签噪声分类。

Conclusion: OCSplats通过创新技术解决了3DGS中的噪声问题，无需调参即可适应不同场景，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D
reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such
as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to
reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods
either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning
of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper
re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of
epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key
technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive
correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive
differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of
varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label
noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline
enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly
different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and
precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测器在未知生成模型下泛化能力不足，CLIP特征的高层语义信息限制了检测效果。

Result: 在40种生成模型的开放世界基准测试中，检测精度提升7.4%。

Conclusion: NS-Net在GAN和扩散模型生成图像检测中表现出强泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models,
has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing
concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing
detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to
generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content
between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the
use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical
limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual
features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,
a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple
semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive
learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and
generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve
fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image
structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images
generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy,
thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and
diffusion-based image generation techniques.

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ、LaPa和Helen数据集上验证了WSFP的挑战性和DisFaceRep的有效性。

Conclusion: DisFaceRep通过解耦表示显著提升了弱监督面部解析的性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes,
lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level
annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To
reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a
new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only
weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.
WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual
similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and
degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a
representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring
facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly
reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to
guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive
experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of
WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms
existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. The code will be
released at

Abstract: In this work, we handle a new problem of Open-Domain Open-Vocabulary (ODOV)

first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers
18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a
comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we
develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first
leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts
for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given
image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to
form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We
provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task
and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the
usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常冻结预训练模型的编码器，导致任务无关表示与聚类需求不匹配，限制了性能。

Method: 第一阶段通过跨模态语义一致性训练轻量级聚类头；第二阶段通过自增强微调策略联合优化编码器和聚类头。

Result: 在六个主流数据集上显著优于现有深度聚类方法，ViT-B/32模型性能甚至超过基于更大ViT-L/14的SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过跨模态语义一致性和自增强微调，有效提升了图像聚类的性能。

Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful
generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the
encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic
representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a
ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced
framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image
clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal
Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.
In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining
consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster
assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to
align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process
is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers
and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In
the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The
well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label
generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back
the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,
unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream
datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by
significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even
surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger
ViT-L/14.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的时空差异网络（STDNet），通过空间和时间差异分支解决视频深度超分辨率中的长尾分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频深度超分辨率中存在明显的长尾分布问题，尤其在空间非平滑区域和时间变化区域，影响了重建质量。

Method: STDNet包含空间差异分支和时间差异分支。空间差异分支通过动态对齐RGB特征和学习空间差异表示来解决空间长尾问题；时间差异分支通过传播相邻帧的时变信息来实现精确运动补偿。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，STDNet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STDNet有效解决了视频深度超分辨率中的长尾分布问题，提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the
incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction
quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth
super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with
the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and
temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a
spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial
difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the
long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically
aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling
intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference
branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially
propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to
the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to
achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive
experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法在图像分辨率或每类图像数量增加时性能下降，且扩散模型生成的图像多样性不足，导致信息冗余。

Method: ACS将蒸馏数据集划分为多个课程，通过对抗损失引导扩散采样过程，减少课程间信息重叠，并随着判别器的进化从简单到复杂生成图像。

Result: 实验表明ACS在Imagewoof和ImageNet-1k上分别比现有方法提升了4.1%和2.1%。

Conclusion: ACS通过对抗引导和课程采样，显著提升了数据集蒸馏的多样性和性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in
dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation
as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent
advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can
effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while
maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution
and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion
models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information
redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a
distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided
Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple
curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling
process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled
images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a
more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with
the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more
complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data
informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on
ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: ModelNet40-E为点云分类模型的鲁棒性和校准性评估提供了新工具，Point Transformer v3在噪声环境下表现最佳。

Abstract: We introduce ModelNet40-E, a new benchmark designed to assess the robustness
and calibration of point cloud classification models under synthetic LiDAR-like
noise. Unlike existing benchmarks, ModelNet40-E provides both noise-corrupted
point clouds and point-wise uncertainty annotations via Gaussian noise
parameters ({\sigma}, {\mu}), enabling fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
modeling. We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point
Transformer v3-across multiple noise levels using classification accuracy,
calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under
increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with
predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement
uncertainty.

Motivation: 现有零样本图像描述方法直接扩展到视频领域效果不佳，忽略了时间动态性。

Method: 提出语义组解码（SGD）策略，结合关键句子选择（KSS）和概率采样监督（PSS）模块。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有零样本方法，甚至接近全监督方法性能。

Conclusion: SGCap通过建模时间动态性和句子间因果关系，提升了零样本视频描述能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos
without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored.
Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only
training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence
embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video
domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects
temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group
Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it
develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame
information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.
Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine
similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by
a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level
supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the
Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision
(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups
that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence
causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video
captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and
even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is

### [237] [PromptSafe: Gated Prompt Tuning for Safe Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01272)
*Zonglei Jing,Xiao Yang,Xiaoqian Li,Siyuan Liang,Aishan Liu,Mingchuan Zhang,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptSafe是一个基于门控提示调优的框架，用于防止文本到图像（T2I）模型生成不安全内容，同时保持良性图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型容易生成不安全内容（如暴力或色情图像），现有防御方法依赖大规模数据集且静态防御，导致计算成本高、适应性差。

Method: 通过LLM重写不安全提示为安全文本，训练轻量级软嵌入，结合门控网络动态调整防御强度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PromptSafe将不安全生成率降至2.36%，同时保持高良性图像质量，并具备强泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PromptSafe为T2I模型提供了一种高效、可扩展的安全部署方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)
content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts
have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the
input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets
and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this
results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,
but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements
of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a
gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised
soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of
training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into
semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an
efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal
soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the
diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we
introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength
based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with
prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving
benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and
T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),
while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates
strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability
across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial
attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度先验的无监督立体匹配框架，通过置信度估计和深度排序学习提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督立体匹配中多视角一致性假设的局限性，如重复模式和纹理缺失区域的问题。

Method: 提出了一种插拔式视差置信度估计算法和两种深度先验引导的损失函数，利用局部一致性检查构建准密集对应关系。

Result: 在KITTI Stereo基准测试中，性能优于现有无监督立体匹配方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效利用3D几何知识，显著提升了无监督立体匹配的准确性。

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its
independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods
rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which
suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive
patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D
geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.
However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information
from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization
of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity
estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to
address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence
estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,
the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their
corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.
Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident
disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a
dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance
at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo
benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型生成临床描述或固定长度提示，限制了信息的丰富性和准确性，且缺乏领域特异性。

Result: 在肾癌和肺癌数据集上表现优于单提示基线，接近最先进模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进文本描述生成和编码策略，显著提升了视觉语言模型在多实例学习中的性能。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性引导的数据增强方法（UgDA），通过扰动RGB空间的图像统计特征生成未见域样本，提升立体匹配模型的跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成数据训练的立体匹配模型在真实数据上泛化能力差的问题，避免模型依赖域相关特征。

Method: 利用RGB空间的均值和标准差作为域特征，通过高斯分布建模扰动方向和强度，生成多样化的域样本，并强制特征一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升了现有立体匹配网络的泛化性能。

Conclusion: UgDA方法简单、架构无关，能有效提升模型对跨域数据的适应能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often
fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as
color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we
leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model
to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of
domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data
augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space
(mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples
in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics.
Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded
on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation
direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency
between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model
to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM
networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have
demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization
performance of existing SM networks.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上平均AUROC分别为66.4%、83.1%和63.4%。

Conclusion: C3D-AD框架在多类别3D异常检测中表现优异，并能持续适应新类别。

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,
respectively.

Result: 在BUSI基准和专有数据集上分类准确率高，但解剖特异性和临床实用性仍有不足。

Conclusion: 需更丰富的上下文感知解释方法和人机交互反馈以满足临床需求。

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal
muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic
challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal
attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two
distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and
the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the
input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an
attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the
BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating
clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in
medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1)
functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and
incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with
seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive
performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical
specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings
highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and
human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world
diagnostic settings.

Method: CSINet通过跨视图窗口注意力模块（CVWin）在编码阶段补充全局和局部语义，并开发了协作扩张注意力增强解码器（CDAD）以整合多尺度特征。

Result: 该方法显著提升了性能，同时保持了较快的速度。

Conclusion: CSINet通过跨视图语义交互和多尺度特征整合，有效解决了遥感图像分割中的挑战。

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory
speed.

Result: 在初步实验中成功分离面部红斑，性能优于基线阈值方法。

Conclusion: 结合生成扩散模型和统计色彩分割，为计算机辅助皮肤病学提供高效红斑检测方法。

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting
erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion
models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are
free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these
references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with
minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach
significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while
providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need
for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the
pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating
performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These
results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and
statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling
efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

Result: 在单样本验证任务中表现优异，并在在线平台验证有效性。

Conclusion: StyleSentinel为艺术作品版权保护提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led
to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to
the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding
additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors,
suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork
published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for
copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint
in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction
process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which
establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature
learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode
abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model
the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the
feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust
one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the
one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through
online platforms.

Motivation: 解决弱监督图像伪造定位（WSIFL）方法因缺乏外部语义指导而性能受限的问题。

Method: 结合视觉-语言特征建模网络和自适应推理网络，通过双预测头（图像级分类和像素级定位）及对比块一致性模块实现定位。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优异，检测和定位准确率均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ViLaCo通过引入语义监督和对比学习，显著提升了弱监督伪造定位的性能。

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both detection and localization accuracy.

Conclusion: RandSF.Q显著优于现有方法，成为新的SOTA。

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables
object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do.
Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator
aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some
queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame.
This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both
(\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative
source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition
dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these
issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction
(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both
slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;
(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature
pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn
transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our
method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points
on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also
benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and
training logs are available as the supplement.

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the
issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational
efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention
mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear
attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight
design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence
modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention
computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the
number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the
process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and
computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature
map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of
key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention
computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to
simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.
Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines
it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.
Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO
2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is
demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both
inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is
5x that of MobileViT-X.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经体积渲染技术的方法（NTM），直接从卫星图像学习数字地形图（DTM），无需深度或其他结构先验，效果接近传统多视立体方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视立体方法生成DTM繁琐且需大量人工预处理，无法满足日益复杂的机器人探索任务需求。

Method: 采用神经体积渲染技术，仅需图像像素位置信息，直接从卫星图像学习DTM。

Result: 在合成和真实卫星数据（地球和火星）上验证，预测精度接近图像分辨率，即使相机参数不完美。

Conclusion: NTM方法展示了直接从卫星图像生成高质量DTM的潜力，为行星探索提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration,
enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent,
and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic
exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will
only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for
satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require
significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this
work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering
techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite
imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for
each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We
demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and
Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the
accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality
DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows
promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the
resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera
intrinsics and extrinsics.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了视觉语言模型（VLM）在手持智能手机和非静态车载摄像头拍摄的视频中用于车牌识别（ALPR）及车辆品牌和型号识别的潜力，提出了基于VLM的管道，并在实验中取得了较高的准确率。

Motivation: 智能交通系统需要高效的车牌和车辆识别技术，但传统方法在动态拍摄条件下表现不佳。VLM的出现为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 研究提出两个管道：ALPR管道通过筛选清晰帧并发送多模态提示给VLM；车辆品牌和型号识别管道使用修订提示和自反思模块。

Conclusion: VLM为动态交通视频分析提供了成本效益高的解决方案，具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

Result: 实验验证了OAPR任务的必要性和所提框架的有效性。

Conclusion: OAPR任务和提出的框架为开放场景下的行人检索提供了新思路，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision
tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing
attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that
all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and
inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world
scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in
benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them
less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these
challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval
(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,
regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support
this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body
part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.
Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the
necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source
code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要在空间域处理RAW图像，难以从像素分布中恢复被抑制的细节，而频域能自然分离特征。

Method: 提出SFAE框架，包括频带空间化、跨域融合注意力模块和自适应非线性调整。

Result: 通过频域和空间域协同，有效提升了目标检测的细节恢复能力。

Conclusion: SFAE框架在RAW图像目标检测中表现出色，为频域和空间域结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

Conclusion: ForenX填补了AI生成图像检测与人类认知分析的差距，提供准确且可解释的检测结果。

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually
indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting
AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and
human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not
only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that
resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we
overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by
incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to
forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the
generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide
explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we
introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences
in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based
agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that
further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited
manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the
effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is
verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出3DRot，一种几何一致的图像增强方法，用于RGB-based 3D任务，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based 3D任务面临标注稀缺、昂贵且数据增强工具不足的问题，传统图像变换会破坏几何一致性。

Method: 3DRot通过绕相机光学中心旋转和镜像图像，同步更新RGB图像、相机内参、物体位姿和3D标注，保持投影几何一致性。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D数据集上，3DRot显著提升3D检测性能（IoU3D、ROT误差和mAP0.5均改善）。

Conclusion: 3DRot是一种即插即用的几何一致增强方法，可轻松迁移到其他3D任务。

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint
estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin
augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

TL;DR: SPECTRUM是一种时频协同模型，通过多域表示学习提升在线手写验证（OHV）性能，结合时域和频域特征，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OHV方法仅使用时域特征，未能充分利用多域表示学习的潜力。SPECTRUM旨在通过时频协同提升验证性能。

Method: SPECTRUM包含三个核心组件：多尺度交互器、自门控融合模块和多域距离验证器，实现时频特征的动态整合与验证。

Result: 实验表明SPECTRUM性能优于现有OHV方法，验证了多域学习的有效性，并揭示多生物特征提升判别力的潜力。

Conclusion: SPECTRUM不仅验证了多域学习的有效性，还为未来多域研究提供了方向，代码已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model
that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for
online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core
components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and
frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale
aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global
temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

Motivation: 现有非局部先验方法因固定格式因子无法适应多样缺失场景，需更灵活的表示方法。

Conclusion: 多粒度分解方法有效提升了高光谱图像恢复的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance.
However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local
self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To
address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition
for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity
non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition
builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural
information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices.
The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local
detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local,
and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of
missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image
analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during
training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual
annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models
lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring
ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two
complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty
maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and
predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark
segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using
Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify
uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,
mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D
skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation
with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25
and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming
previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation,
Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson
correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we
propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates
into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive
assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based
embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability,
highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

Conclusion: Can3Tok为3D场景生成提供了有效解决方案，并展示了在图像到3DGS和文本到3DGS生成任务中的应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely
remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been
rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent
representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative
models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,
scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,
making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level
variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian
primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures
both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we
propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale
inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D
dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to
novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred
scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during
inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as
our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation
tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge
in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the
high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose
EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation
models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for
robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a
modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level
embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures
both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph
Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor
subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a
full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment.
Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that
EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced
memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and
graph-based baselines. This work offers a clinically viable solution for fast

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

Conclusion: 渐进式训练方法使小模型在保持计算效率的同时实现竞争力的视频推理性能。

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks,
small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning
required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that
enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training
process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning
on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We
build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by
incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also
propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that
provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments
on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%,
94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9,
15.8, and 12.3 points over baselines. Ablation studies validate that our
progressive training methodology enables smaller models to achieve competitive

Conclusion: MagicVL-2B为移动设备上的视觉语言应用提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in
recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications in everyday life.
However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this
work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship
smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than
100M parameters and features a redesigned dynamic resolution scheme that
adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety
of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that
MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish
MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile
vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run
directly on smartphones.

*Zeyu Xu,Junkang Zhang,Qiang Wang,Yi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-VRAG是一种高效的视频检索增强生成框架，通过分层查询分解和轻量级VLM减少计算成本，同时提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频RAG方法在检索效率和准确性之间难以平衡，尤其面对复杂视频内容时表现不佳。

Method: 采用分层查询分解预过滤无关帧，轻量级VLM评分，全局统计分布优化检索策略，多视角问答增强理解。

Result: 在四个公开基准测试中，E-VRAG减少约70%计算成本且准确性更高。

Conclusion: E-VRAG有效提升了视频RAG任务的效率和准确性，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video
understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high
computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only
the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden.
Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video
content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient
video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame
pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate
irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then
employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational
costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy
that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to
mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM.
Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved
frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information
from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that
E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy
compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and
accuracy for video RAG tasks.

TL;DR: GlimpsePrune是一种动态剪枝框架，通过数据驱动的“一瞥”方法高效剪枝视觉令牌，显著减少计算成本，同时保持或提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定压缩比方法无法适应不同复杂度的场景，导致信息丢失和性能下降，需要一种动态剪枝方法。

Method: 提出GlimpsePrune框架，通过单次前向传递剪枝无关视觉令牌，实现高效压缩。

Result: 剪枝92.6%视觉令牌，基准性能完全保留；GlimpsePrune+性能提升至基准的110%。

Conclusion: GlimpsePrune为构建更强大高效的LVLMs提供了新途径。

Abstract: Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically
adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity,
often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and
results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a
dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes
a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single
forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual
tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form
VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective
fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline
performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a
new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

TL;DR: EvoVLMA方法利用LLM辅助的进化算法自动搜索训练无关的高效视觉语言模型适配算法，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型适配方法依赖人工设计，耗时且需经验，EvoVLMA旨在自动化这一过程。

Method: 提出两阶段LLM辅助进化算法，优化特征选择和logits计算，并通过低精度代码转换等技术提升搜索效率。

Result: 在8-shot图像分类任务中，EvoVLMA发现的算法比人工设计的APE算法准确率提升1.91%。

Conclusion: EvoVLMA为预训练多模态模型适配算法的自动化优化开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various
Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such
as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are
designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.
Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code
generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation
(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation
algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as
the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage
LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential
manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search
space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability
and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,
web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective
automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous
manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification
setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in
recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the
optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is

*Sara Shoouri,Morteza Tavakoli Taba,Hun-Seok Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于历史感知的自适应扫描框架，通过预测感兴趣区域（ROI）减少LiDAR冗余扫描，显著降低能耗，同时保持3D物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR传感器在密集扫描时忽略时间连续性，导致冗余和能耗问题，限制了其在资源受限平台上的实用性。

Method: 使用轻量级预测网络提取历史时空上下文，生成查询嵌入，并通过可微分掩码生成器网络和Gumbel-Softmax采样确定关键ROI，实现自适应扫描。

Result: 在nuScenes和Lyft基准测试中，LiDAR能耗降低65%以上，3D物体检测性能与传统方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了LiDAR冗余扫描问题，显著降低了能耗，同时保持了检测性能，适用于资源受限平台。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D
object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense,
stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes.
This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption,
limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning
framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past
observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that
distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query
embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network,
which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying
critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces
unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within
these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft
benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy
consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D
object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion
methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

TL;DR: 论文提出LetheViT方法，解决ViTs中随机数据遗忘的隐私合规问题，通过选择性掩码和对比学习实现高效遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私法规（如GDPR和CCPA）要求用户数据可撤回，需从模型中完全移除其影响，而ViTs的随机数据遗忘尤为挑战。

Method: 通过选择性掩码实验揭示ViTs特性，提出LetheViT方法，利用掩码图像生成正对数，原始图像生成负对数，实现对比遗忘。

Result: LetheViT在隐私合规与模型效能间取得平衡，性能达到最优。

Conclusion: LetheViT为ViTs提供了一种高效的隐私合规解决方案，适用于随机数据遗忘场景。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with
their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations
such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant
users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of
data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.
Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being
computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TopoImages的新方法，通过编码图像局部拓扑结构生成多通道图像表示，显著提升了深度学习框架下的图像分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在处理图像时缺乏对拓扑结构的敏感性，而拓扑结构（如连通性和环路）对理解图像内容（如生物医学对象）至关重要。

Method: 利用持久同调（PH）编码图像局部补丁的几何和拓扑特征，生成持久图（PDs），并将其向量化为多通道图像表示（TopoImage）。进一步通过多种过滤函数生成多视图TopoImages，并与原始图像融合用于分类。

Result: 在三个公共医学图像分类数据集上的实验表明，TopoImages显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TopoImages为数据分析和深度学习提供了新的视角，能够无缝集成到常见框架中，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops,
play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects).
% Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely
on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological
structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. % In this paper,
we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images),
which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology
of patches. % In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode
geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. % Our main
objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input
image into a vectorized form. % Specifically, we first compute persistence
diagrams (PDs) of the patches, % and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into
long vectors for pixels of the patches. % The resulting multi-channel
image-form representation is called a TopoImage. % TopoImages offers a new
perspective for data analysis. % To garner diverse and significant topological
features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched
representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image
using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. % The
multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based
classification, with considerable improvement. % Our TopoImages approach is
highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks.
Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate
noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SECA的统一框架，利用文本语义先验来解决持续学习中的稳定性与可塑性矛盾，通过语义引导的知识转移和视觉原型优化提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习（CL）模型需要在不遗忘旧知识的情况下学习新任务，但现有方法在知识转移时未考虑语义相关性，导致稳定性与可塑性失衡。此外，视觉和文本分类器各有局限性。

Method: 提出SECA框架，包含语义引导的自适应知识转移模块（SG-AKT）和语义增强的视觉原型优化模块（SE-VPR），分别用于语义感知的知识转移和视觉原型的语义优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验验证了SECA的有效性。

Conclusion: SECA通过利用文本语义先验，成功解决了持续学习中的稳定性与可塑性矛盾，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a
stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of
vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),
their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong
generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in
CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.
During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without
considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks
that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while
text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited
plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help
bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation
(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured
nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the
backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.
Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is
proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge
via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive
manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype
Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using
inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖标注数据导致领域偏差和低效部署，且零样本方法因粗粒度估计和开环流程性能受限，需改进时间交互定位的精度。

Method: EgoLoc采用自适应采样策略生成视觉提示，结合2D和3D观测，通过3D手部速度采样高质量初始猜测，并利用闭环反馈优化定位结果。

Result: 在公开数据集和新基准测试中，EgoLoc优于现有基线方法，实现了更优的时间交互定位性能。

Conclusion: EgoLoc通过自适应采样和闭环反馈显著提升了零样本时间交互定位的精度和效率，适用于自我中心视频分析。

Abstract: Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the
foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and
human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods
typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for
optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency.
Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization
(ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained
estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for
temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a
novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp
actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a
self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM
reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples
high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps
of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and
efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and
dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive
experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark
demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for
egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our
code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Set Pivot Learning (SPL)，一种基于视觉基础模型(VFMs)的新领域泛化范式，取代传统假设，强调动态适应和VFM中心调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统领域泛化(DG)假设目标域在训练时不可访问，但VFMs的出现使这一假设过时。SPL旨在更适应当前研究和应用需求。

Method: SPL通过动态适应和VFM中心调优实现灵活任务驱动优化，提出动态提示微调方法，结合动态类感知提示器和提示引导特征聚焦器。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有技术，尤其在广义分割任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: SPL为领域迁移任务提供了更灵活、高效的解决方案，推动了基于VFMs的研究和应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot
Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain
is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and
diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG
assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the
emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this
assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set
Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,
which is more suitable for current research and application requirements.
Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid
domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world
conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic
adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven
feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)
VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone
task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.
Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines
a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate
VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法在随机人体运动预测中难以学习连续时间动态且易出现模式崩溃，忽视了复杂人体运动的灵活性。

Method: STCN分为两阶段：第一阶段通过时空连续网络生成平滑运动序列并引入锚点集防止模式崩溃；第二阶段利用锚点集学习高斯混合分布并采样多序列以减少类内差异。

Result: 在Human3.6M和HumanEva-I数据集上，STCN在多样性和准确性上均表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: STCN通过两阶段设计和锚点集的引入，有效解决了随机人体运动预测中的关键问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention
due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,
existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics
and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the
flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.
To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for
stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two
stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal
continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,
the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to
prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In
the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution
(GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also
focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the
strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate
intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two
widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model
obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决终身行人重识别中存储历史样本带来的隐私问题，同时避免因不存储原始样本导致的性能下降。

Method: 通过将多个真实图像的特征压缩到单个图像中，生成隐私保护的压缩样本，并在风格重放阶段进行双重对齐以缓解领域偏移和遗忘问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Pr^2R比现有方法在顺序任务上分别提高了4%和6%的准确率。

Conclusion: Pr^2R在保护数据隐私的同时，显著提升了终身行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate
knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,
replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by
rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing
historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,
exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without
storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer
from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge
representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from
sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling
Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the
training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the
condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the
privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more
representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align
the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay
samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy
effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused
by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the
proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving
data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on
sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other
replay-based methods, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预训练的正常数据特征，缺乏动态适应性，SNARM旨在通过自参考学习增强异常判别能力。

Method: SNARM通过计算测试图像块与训练特征库的残差，利用高正常性块生成自参考块，结合多头Mamba模块动态聚焦异常区域。

Result: 在MVTec AD、MVTec 3D和VisA基准测试中，SNARM在各项指标上均达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SNARM通过自参考学习和动态残差比较，显著提升了工业异常检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel
framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages
``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly
discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained
features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection
by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image
references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by
contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches
exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized
as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying
discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are
concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are
dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions.
Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated
Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD,
MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including
Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态跟踪中不同模态间的特征融合问题，提升性能。

Result: 在五个基准测试中达到最优性能，仅需0.93M可训练参数。

Conclusion: DMTrack通过双适配器设计实现了高效的多模态跟踪，性能显著。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为CLIMD的课程学习框架，用于解决多模态医学数据中的类别不平衡问题，通过结合模态内置信度和模态间互补性，逐步适应复杂类别分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态医学数据常面临类别不平衡问题，现有方法易过拟合或欠拟合，且难以捕捉跨模态交互。

Method: 设计了多模态课程测量器和类别分布引导的训练调度器，逐步适应不平衡类别分布。

Result: 在多个多模态医学数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其擅长处理不平衡数据。

Conclusion: CLIMD作为一种即插即用的框架，可轻松集成到其他模型中，提升多模态疾病诊断的准确性。

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the
most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging
multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,
due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face
the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the
features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with
resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or
underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we
propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis
(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that
combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal
complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually
adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class
distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model
to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various
metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,
as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other
models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis
accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

TL;DR: FG-PAN是一种针对数字病理学的零样本框架，通过局部特征细化模块和细粒度文本描述生成模块，显著提高了脑肿瘤亚型分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤亚型的细粒度分类因形态学差异细微和标注数据稀缺而极具挑战性，现有视觉语言模型在细粒度病理特征捕捉上表现不足。

Method: FG-PAN包含两个关键模块：局部特征细化模块（优化斑块级视觉特征）和细粒度文本描述生成模块（利用大语言模型生成病理感知的语义原型）。

Result: 在多个公共病理数据集（如EBRAINS和TCGA）上，FG-PAN实现了最先进的零样本脑肿瘤亚型分类性能。

Conclusion: FG-PAN通过视觉与语义空间的对齐，显著提升了分类性能，展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from
histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle
morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although
vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their
ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited,
resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we
propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot
framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules:
(1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features
by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a
fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language
models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By
aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions,
FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic
spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including
EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance
and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IAPL的新框架，通过自适应模块提升AI生成图像检测的灵活性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在检测未知生成器生成的假图像时泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 采用Conditional Information Learner和Confidence-Driven Adaptive Prediction两个模块，动态调整输入提示以适应不同图像。

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect和GenImage数据集上分别达到95.61%和96.7%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: IAPL框架显著提升了检测未知生成器生成的假图像的能力，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images
from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize
pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning.
However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to
generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework
named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in
processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e.,
the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive
Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn
forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to
learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest
learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view
with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules
enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted
based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby
enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive
experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61%
and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage
datasets, respectively.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在图像地理定位任务中的潜力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过IMAGEO-Bench基准，使用三个多样化数据集评估10种先进LLMs的性能，分析准确性、距离误差、地理偏见和推理过程。

Result: 闭源模型表现更优，但存在地理偏见（高资源地区表现更好）；成功定位依赖于识别城市环境、户外场景、街景和地标。

Conclusion: IMAGEO-Bench为LLMs的空间推理能力提供了严谨评估，并为构建地理定位感知的AI系统提供了启示。

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location
depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital
forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their
ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,
we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates
accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark
includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of
interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen
images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-
and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with
closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we
uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource
regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting
degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics
demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on
recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and
identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the
spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building
geolocation-aware AI systems.

Conclusion: LLaDA-MedV在生物医学图像理解任务中表现出色，通过控制响应长度生成更丰富的信息，并揭示了训练和推理阶段的关键因素。

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical
vision-language models (VLMs). Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA
have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical
domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for
biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV
achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over
LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks:
84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a
detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of
generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response
length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth
analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical
roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the
interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model
weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.

Motivation: 尽管G-PCC标准具有低计算功耗和互操作性优势，但其压缩效率不及基于深度学习的方法。研究旨在提升G-PCC的效率而不牺牲其优势。

Method: 提出了一种预处理框架，结合了压缩导向的体素化网络和可微分的G-PCC替代模型，通过端到端梯度传播优化。

Result: 实验显示平均BD-rate降低了38.84%，显著提升了G-PCC的压缩效率。

Conclusion: 该工作为增强传统压缩标准提供了实用途径，同时保持向后兼容性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard
designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of
point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices.
However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods
despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of
G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we
propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented
voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly
optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion
behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient
propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input
point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates
point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing
for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight
voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no
modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for
end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction
over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a
practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving
their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera,
with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we
propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively
combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency,
reflections, and occlusions. This module can be seamlessly integrated with
various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution.
Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset
collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a
valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results
show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the
WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
and boundary IoU (bIoU), achieving a 7.49% improvement in bIoU when integrated
with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for
advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of
collisions with glass objects.

Motivation: 解决WSI分析中因领域差距和冗余补丁导致的性能下降和训练成本高的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段选择性采样策略和Local-to-Global网络，整合局部细节与全局上下文信息。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CDSR以少量高分辨率补丁（平均9个/WSI）实现了6.3%的准确率和5.5%的AUC提升。

Conclusion: CDSR在效率和形态保真度上优于现有方法，显著减少了训练成本并提升了性能。

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel
scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level
prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while
overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction
stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap
and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown
promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds
upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.
This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and
interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and
drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a
Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an
average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust
slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling
strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both
model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a
Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution
WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global
contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR
is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on
Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves
improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream
classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches
per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over
10,000,000 patches.

Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which
offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key
challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch
patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy
that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale
adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to
ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and
precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be
released at [GitHub](https://github.com/fighting-Zhang/StrandDesigner).

Conclusion: DAG通过扩散模型的内部表示成功提取了通用可供性知识，为3D可供性预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d
object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,
embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem
via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture
the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor
generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image
diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find
that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate
that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world
affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d
affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal
representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance
knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We
further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to
endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world
generalization.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖强提示（如可见掩码或边界框），成本高且不实用；同时缺乏几何解释性，难以推断遮挡形状。

Method: VELA通过构建初始水平集函数，并在形状特定运动场的引导下逐步演化轮廓，实现几何基础和拓扑灵活的建模。

Result: 在COCOA-cls、D2SA和KINS基准测试中，VELA优于现有方法，仅需单点提示。

Conclusion: VELA通过可解释的几何建模，在弱提示下实现了高效的模态分割。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including
occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation
focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong
prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or
impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they
often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape
evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,
most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric
interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are
inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end
VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit
contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial
level set function from image features and the point input, which then
progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a
shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This
network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling
geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive
experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA
outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a
single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric
modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both
visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to
complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly
deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single
model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse
amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to
adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different
shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's
underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and
insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized
experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific
sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to
learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a
lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,
ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures
key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to
the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert
routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting
occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well
interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining
high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show
that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

TL;DR: EST-LoRA是一种无需训练的LoRA融合方法，通过综合考虑矩阵能量、风格差异分数和时间步长，自适应选择主题和风格LoRA，实现平衡生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以平衡主题和风格，且需要额外训练，K-LoRA虽无需训练但超参数复杂。

Method: 提出EST-LoRA，基于能量、风格差异和时间步长，类似MoE架构自适应选择LoRA。

Result: 实验表明EST-LoRA在质量和速度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EST-LoRA无需训练，高效平衡主题与风格，生成效果和速度更优。

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable
performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have
explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and
content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and
style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a
training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters,
making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we
propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It
comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix,
\underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between
subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated
selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during
the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and
achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rein++是一个基于视觉基础模型(VFMs)的高效语义分割框架，通过域泛化(Rein-G)和域适应(Rein-A)解决数据规模差异和域分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VFMs在语义分割中面临数据规模小和域分布偏移的挑战，Rein++旨在克服这些限制。

Method: Rein++结合Rein-G（实例感知令牌微调）和Rein-A（无监督域适应），利用SAM增强边界细节。

Result: Rein++在高效训练下显著优于现有方法，适用于大规模模型。

Conclusion: Rein++是一个高效、泛化性强且适应性强的VFM分割解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is
hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as
segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM
pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation
scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To
overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based
segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited
data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.
Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a
domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,
instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the
segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of
the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the
Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and
logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic
transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment
anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated
Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,
daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,
nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and
adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of
parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/wloves/Rein.

TL;DR: PatchMap是首个空间详尽的对抗性补丁放置基准，通过评估1.5亿次ImageNet验证图像前向传播，揭示小补丁（仅占图像的2%）导致高误分类率的系统热点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性补丁攻击威胁现代视觉模型的可靠性，需要系统研究补丁放置的影响。

Method: 提出PatchMap基准，并设计一种基于分割的启发式方法，利用现成掩码识别易受攻击区域，无需梯度查询。

Result: 在五种架构（包括对抗训练的ResNet50）上，该方法比随机或固定放置提高攻击成功率8-13个百分点。

Conclusion: PatchMap及其代码公开，未来将发布完整基准（6.5B预测）以推动位置感知防御和自适应攻击研究。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

*Haohan Zheng,Zhenguo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过调整视觉和文本模态的注意力权重，减少大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLM在理解多模态内容时存在物体幻觉问题，主要原因是模型对视觉和文本模态的注意力不平衡。

Method: 提出一种训练免费的方法，通过干预和调整文本与视觉标记的注意力权重，并结合对比解码策略，减少对参数知识的依赖。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效减少多个开源LVLM和基准测试中的幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 该方法具有普适性和高效性，为LVLM的幻觉问题提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe
object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to
linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large
language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon
LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,
generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an
in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a
previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information
but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality
bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both
visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of
user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet
effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we
intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,
balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.
Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's
overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our
attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence
of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates
hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting
its generalizability and efficacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）因多模态信息对齐困难导致的幻觉问题。

Method: 提出Prompt-in-Image方法，将文本指令直接嵌入图像，强制模型通过视觉通道处理所有内容。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL性能提升（POPE准确率提高4.1%），而LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP性能显著下降。

Conclusion: Prompt-in-Image方法对某些VLMs有效，但需注意模型视觉编码器对嵌入文本的处理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to
challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

TL;DR: DisCo3D提出了一种新框架，通过将3D一致性先验蒸馏到2D编辑器中，解决了3D编辑中的多视角一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在2D图像生成和编辑中表现优异，但扩展到3D编辑时面临多视角一致性的挑战。现有方法存在收敛慢、模糊伪影和细粒度不一致等问题。

Method: DisCo3D首先通过多视角输入微调3D生成器以适应场景，然后通过一致性蒸馏训练2D编辑器，最后通过高斯泼溅将编辑后的多视角输出优化为3D表示。

Result: 实验表明，DisCo3D在多视角一致性上表现稳定，编辑质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DisCo3D通过结合3D一致性先验和2D编辑，有效解决了3D编辑中的多视角一致性问题。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image
generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains
challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical
approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement
based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow
convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent
methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet
still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes
due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D},
a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our
method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene
adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The
edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via
Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable
multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing
quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PromptReg的无训练图像配准方法，通过直接搜索对应提示简化了传统的两步区域匹配过程，利用预训练分割模型实现高效配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像配准方法需要先分割感兴趣区域再匹配，步骤繁琐且效率低。本文旨在简化这一过程，直接通过提示搜索实现区域匹配。

Method: 提出“对应提示问题”，并通过“逆向提示”解决方案生成主提示和辅助提示，将提示X反转到图像Y的提示空间。最后提出一种新配准算法，通过边缘化提示X在提示和空间维度上识别多对对应ROI。

Result: 在3D前列腺MR、3D腹部MR、3D肺部CT、2D组织病理学和2D航空图像等五个应用中，PromptReg在Dice和目标配准误差等指标上优于基于强度的迭代算法和基于学习的DDF预测网络，甚至与需要全分割训练数据的弱监督方法表现相当。

Conclusion: PromptReg通过直接搜索对应提示简化了图像配准流程，实现了高效且准确的区域匹配，为图像配准提供了一种新的无训练解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core
challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based
correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to
enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at
pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two
steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.
In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for
corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models
(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we
introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a
corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,
such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of
corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse
prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,
inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a
novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs
by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial
dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of
registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,
as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and
target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration
outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based
DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with
weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成平滑且合理的过渡视频方面研究不足，尤其是基于首尾帧和文本提示的生成任务。

Method: VTG采用插值初始化、双向运动微调和表示对齐正则化技术，优化预训练图像到视频扩散模型。

Result: VTG在TransitBench基准测试中表现优异，覆盖概念混合和场景过渡两类任务。

Conclusion: VTG在过渡视频生成任务中表现出色，为未来统一过渡生成研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as
conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated
and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational
transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive
text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video
Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically
coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization
that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes
effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning
and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of
pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation
fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on
unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition
tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that
VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four
tasks.

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型对所有任务标记采用静态处理路径，无法区分时间定位、显著性评估和文本生成等不同任务的需求。

Method: 提出TimeExpert，利用Mixture-of-Experts架构动态路由任务特定标记到专业专家，提高计算效率和任务处理精度。

Result: 在多种视频时间定位任务（如密集视频字幕、时刻检索和视频高光检测）中，TimeExpert表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TimeExpert通过任务分解和动态路由，显著提升了视频时间定位任务的性能，成为当前最优方法。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event
segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as
sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and
textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation
persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all
task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that
temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent
fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this,
we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that
effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens
(e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased
computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each
subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video
Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

Motivation: 由于3D高斯泼溅生成地图的时间和计算成本高，如何更新地图成为自动驾驶场景中的关键挑战。

Result: 实验表明，LT-Gaussian能高效更新地图，处理常见环境变化，并生成比从头重建更高质量的结果。

Conclusion: LT-Gaussian通过利用新旧场景信息，提供了一种高效且高质量的地图更新解决方案。

Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently
proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit
scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction
in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational
costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a
significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update
method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:
Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and
Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is
generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,
during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the
current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform
targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We
establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to
quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that
LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling
common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by
taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian
is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update
strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

Result: 在多个数据集（MSR-VTT、DiDeMo等）上取得SOTA结果，且效率显著提升。

Conclusion: GAID通过互补模块优化跨模态匹配，生成更稳定和表达性强的表示。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an
evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at

Conclusion: GCC提供了一种概念级别的模型解释方法，为理解深度视觉模型中的概念编码提供了新视角。

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by
leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts
emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the
distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

Method: 提出AMOT，包括外观-运动一致性矩阵（AMC）和运动感知轨迹延续模块（MTC），联合优化外观和运动线索。

Result: 在三个无人机基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且无需训练即可即插即用。

Conclusion: AMOT通过联合利用外观和运动线索，显著提升了无人机视频中的多目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining
consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex
UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often
lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing
methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking
their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking
performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance
and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency
(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,
the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance
of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity
association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks
through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,
thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive
experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and
VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

*Yuxiang Zhang,Wei Li,Mengmeng Zhang,Jiawei Han,Ran Tao,Shunlin Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectralX是一个参数高效的微调框架，通过两阶段训练方法，将现有遥感基础模型（RSFMs）适应于多光谱/高光谱数据，提升领域泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多光谱/高光谱数据缺乏对应基础模型的问题，探索如何有效利用现有RSFMs处理多样光谱模态。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方法：第一阶段通过掩码重建任务和Hyper Tokenizer提取空间和光谱维度的属性令牌，第二阶段通过Attribute-refined Adapter迭代查询低级语义特征。

Result: SpectralX能够解释新区域或季节的光谱图像，显著提升领域泛化性能。

Conclusion: SpectralX为多光谱/高光谱数据的处理提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to
significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained
with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack
of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral
imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be
effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring
extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed
SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt
existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to
handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain
generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a
masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to
extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.
Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)
that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing
layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the
second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the
first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with
high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial
attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase
adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from
new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过将语义特征附加到自由高斯集合并通过可微分渲染提取特征，导致分割噪声和高斯选择混乱，需要更有效的语义感知3D高斯表示。

Method: 提出AG$^2$aussian框架，利用锚点图结构组织语义特征并规范高斯基元，促进紧凑且实例感知的高斯分布，支持基于图的传播。

Result: 在四种应用（交互式点击查询、开放词汇文本驱动查询、对象移除编辑和物理模拟）中验证了方法的优势，实验和消融研究证实了关键设计的有效性。

Conclusion: AG$^2$aussian通过锚点图结构显著提升了3D高斯泼溅的语义感知能力，适用于多种场景理解和编辑任务。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across
diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian
representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing
approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians
and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy
segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce
AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to
organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph
structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,
but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate
instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four
applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven
query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the
advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The
experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key
designs of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEA的新型灰盒越狱攻击方法，通过模拟微调轨迹和优化提示指导，成功攻击了微调后的视觉语言模型，揭示了开源基础模型漏洞的传递风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示开源视觉语言模型（VLMs）微调后可能保留的漏洞，这些漏洞可能被攻击者利用，导致微调后的模型易受越狱攻击。

Method: 方法包括Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS)和Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG)，分别模拟视觉编码器的参数变化和优化语言解码器的输出。

Result: 实验结果表明，SEA在Qwen2-VL家族模型上实现了超过86.5%的转移攻击成功率和49.5%的毒性率。

Conclusion: 结论强调了保护微调后的专有VLMs免受开源基础模型漏洞传递的紧迫性，并呼吁开发全生命周期的防御措施。

Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet
underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained
in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak
attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack
(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access
to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training
configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA
combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and
Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images
by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual
strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized
outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA
achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates
near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically
fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image
jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits
inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing
transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard
fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from
open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across
the entire model lifecycle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期动作预测在人机交互和辅助技术中至关重要，但现有方法未能充分利用手-物体交互的细粒度视觉线索、忽略动词-名词语义依赖，且缺乏显式认知推理。

Method: INSIGHT分两阶段：1) 提取手-物体交互特征并利用动词-名词共现矩阵增强动作表示；2) 通过强化学习模块模拟认知推理（感知->推理->预测）。

Result: 在Ego4D、EPIC-Kitchens-55和EGTEA Gaze+基准测试中，INSIGHT实现了最先进的性能，展示了其有效性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: INSIGHT通过结合细粒度视觉特征和显式认知推理，显著提升了长期动作预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

*Runkai Zheng,Vishnu Asutosh Dasu,Yinong Oliver Wang,Haohan Wang,Fernando De la Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，通过解耦采样与优化过程，并利用信息子空间匹配减少DP噪声影响，显著提升了隐私保护数据集蒸馏的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习依赖大量敏感数据，隐私保护成为关键问题。差分隐私数据生成虽能保护隐私，但需要大量数据且效率低。数据集蒸馏（DD）效率高，但现有方法存在采样-优化同步和噪声信号依赖问题。

Method: 提出新框架，解耦采样与优化，通过信息子空间匹配减少DP噪声影响。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，每类50张图像时性能提升10.0%，蒸馏集大小仅为先前方法的五分之一时提升8.3%。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了隐私保护DD的性能，为隐私保护机器学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奶牛活动和行为与健康及福利相关，但人工监测费时且不一致，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用多摄像头系统，结合YOLO11-m模型和SAMURAI算法进行实例分割与跟踪，通过运动感知卡尔曼滤波和IoU数据关联实现可靠跟踪。

Result: 系统在多目标跟踪准确率（MOTA）和身份一致性（IDF1）上表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该系统能实时准确跟踪奶牛活动，有望通过行为分类提升疾病早期预测能力。

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces
redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows
move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction
through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言在指导导航时存在模糊性和冗长问题，因此需要一种更直观、空间明确的视觉提示方法。

Method: 提出VPN范式，使用2D俯视图标记导航轨迹；构建R2R-VP和R2R-CE-VP数据集；设计VPNet网络，采用视图级和轨迹级数据增强策略。

Result: 实验评估了视觉提示形式、俯视图格式和数据增强策略对导航性能的影响。

Conclusion: VPN方法为非专家用户提供了更友好的导航指导，减少了语言模糊性，并通过数据增强提升了性能。

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the
inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of
language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose
Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate
using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual
prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a
top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance
without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert
users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete
and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and
R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding
visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network
to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level
augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and
trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from
large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive
experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data
augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The
code is available at https://github.com/farlit/VPN.

Conclusion: DiffSemanticFusion有效结合栅格和图表示，地图扩散模块可无缝集成其他方法，提升性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road
geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map
generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map
informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end
autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art
results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition,
extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module
can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance
performance. All artifacts are available at

Method: 使用3D点表示CT图像，通过图推理模块学习点邻域间的亲和力，隐式获取肝脏血管结构信息。

Result: 在MSD和LiTS数据集上，Dice系数和平均表面距离得分优于四种点基方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需显式提供肝脏血管结构先验知识，通过图推理模块实现了高效的Couinaud分割。

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities
across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS
public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores
compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant
progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from
videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In
this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances
image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented
motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion
estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an
iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data,
we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify
valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including
key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively
integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper presents a simple algebraic method to estimate the pose of a
camera relative to a planar target from $n \geq 4$ reference points with known
coordinates in the target frame and their corresponding bearing measurements in
the camera frame. The proposed approach follows a hierarchical structure;
first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by
the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally,
the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise,
an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's
normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated
through extensive experiments.

TL;DR: OmniEvent是一个统一的事件表示学习框架，解决了事件相机数据在时空分布上的不均匀性问题，无需任务特定设计即可在多任务中实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机数据因非结构化分布和时空不均匀性，导致现有架构难以复用，需任务特定设计。

Method: 提出解耦-增强-融合范式，独立处理时空特征，利用空间填充曲线扩大感受野，并通过注意力融合特征。

Result: 在3个代表性任务和10个数据集上，OmniEvent比任务特定SOTA方法性能提升高达68.2%。

Conclusion: OmniEvent通过统一框架解决了事件相机数据的处理难题，为多任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to
their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks
heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution
and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing
architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event
representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse
tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous
methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T
scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the
local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial
and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are
applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute
efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to
learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which
enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture
change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent
out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks
and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in

domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

### [323] [Context Guided Transformer Entropy Modeling for Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01852)
*Junlong Tong,Wei Zhang,Yaohui Jin,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CGT的熵模型，通过重新采样时间上下文和加权空间上下文来减少视频冗余，同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用时空上下文时存在模型复杂性和计算成本高的问题，且空间上下文缺乏显式建模依赖顺序。

Method: 使用时间上下文重采样器和教师-学生网络分别处理时间和空间上下文，显式建模依赖关系。

Result: CGT模型将熵建模时间减少约65%，BD-Rate降低11%。

Conclusion: CGT模型在减少冗余和计算成本方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to
reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often
introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In
parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the
ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant
context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided
Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of
the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and
dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns
predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using
transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a
teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context
assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The
teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy
map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the
student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial
dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded
tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that
our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves
an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional
entropy model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在自由视觉搜索中区分目标与非目标注视点的方法，使用眼动和脑电图数据，在现实场景中取得了83.6%的准确率，显著优于之前的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在区分目标与非目标注视点时，多基于抽象视觉刺激和明确指令的搜索轨迹，忽略了场景上下文。然而，人类视觉搜索受场景特征影响很大，因此需要研究更现实的场景。

Method: 通过36名参与者的用户研究，使用140个现实场景（如桌面图标和杂乱工具间），结合眼动和脑电图特征进行分类。

Result: 提出的方法在跨用户评估中达到83.6%的准确率，显著优于之前基于注视持续时间和眼跳相关电位的方法（56.9%）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了在现实场景中区分目标与非目标注视点的能力，为理解用户意图和构建辅助系统提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a
fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build
effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of
classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and
electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly
instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any
scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search
is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding
generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the
first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations
during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a
36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search
scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on
desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach
based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related
potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of
our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the
ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic
scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This
substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials,
which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

Result: 在跨数据集和数据集内测试中，DiffusionFF表现出卓越的检测性能和精细的伪造痕迹定位能力。

Conclusion: DiffusionFF在检测和定位伪造痕迹方面均表现出高效性，为深度伪造检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and
accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image
has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize
forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model
explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose
DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through
diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising
diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps,
which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are
then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery
detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers
precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall
effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为StreamAgent的方法，通过预测未来任务相关信息的时间和空间区域，实现实时视频流中的主动决策和响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在实时视频流处理中缺乏任务驱动的规划和未来预测，限制了响应速度和决策能力。

Method: 结合问题语义和历史观察，通过提示预测关键事件的时间进展，并设计流式KV缓存机制以提高效率。

Result: 在实时和长视频理解任务中，该方法在响应准确性和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StreamAgent在实时视频流处理中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving
and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video
processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional
KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy
and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world
streaming scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗影像数据共享中患者隐私保护是重要挑战，现有去标识化工具缺乏客观评估方法。

Method: 使用TCIA公开数据构建MIDI数据集，嵌入合成PHI/PII，并提供评估工具和标准。

Result: 数据集包含538名受试者、53,581个DICOM实例，支持自动化评估去标识化效果。

Conclusion: 该框架为医疗图像共享提供了更安全、一致的去标识化评估标准。

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to
promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring
patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard
data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and
extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable
information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers,
preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to
perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on
subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To
address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with
synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image
de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset
was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing),
605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple
vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were
embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel
data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams.
Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known
truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data
against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA
Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and
TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of
de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image
sharing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全天智能眼镜在连续传感和AI代理集成中的能源效率问题。

Method: 结合轻量级音频模型（YAMNet）和自定义分类头，通过手物交互音频触发图像捕捉。

Result: 平均减少54%的帧数，显著节省能源，同时在记忆任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: EgoTrigger为全天候智能眼镜提供了一种高效节能的上下文感知触发策略。

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业检测中管理多个任务专用模型复杂且低效，统一视觉语言模型（VLM）可能简化流程。

Method: 使用基于Florence-2的InspectVLM，并在新的大规模多模态数据集InspectMM上训练。

Result: InspectVLM在分类和关键点任务中表现良好，但在核心检测指标上不如ResNet模型，且存在提示敏感性和语言记忆问题。

Conclusion: 当前VLM缺乏视觉基础和鲁棒性，不适合高精度工业检测应用。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision
pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection,
and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This
architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing
disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and
maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of
this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on
InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While
InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured
keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models
in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under
low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object
detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless
of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification
offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and
robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial
inspections.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately
distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in
size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have
shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical
image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net
architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell
instance segmentation tasks. Code is available at

Result: 在CIFAR-10和GTSRB上的实验表明，DBOM能有效检测中毒图像，提升DNN训练管道的安全性。

Conclusion: DBOM通过解耦和零样本泛化能力，为对抗攻击模式提供了更深入的理解和防御手段。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

To benchmark our method and foster further research, we introduce two newly

proposed framework has been validated through extensive comparative analyses on
these datasets, demonstrating that our system achieves superior performance in

applications such as aerial navigation, search and rescue, and automated

Conclusion: 对比自监督学习为一阶段检测器提供了有效的预训练方法，展示了无标注数据在标签高效目标检测中的潜力。

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art
performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on
large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a
systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to
reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled
images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet
effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,
employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss
using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained
backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled
data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently
higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,
especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8
achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart
despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a
strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and
highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for
label-efficient object detection.

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in
assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant
volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and
processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point
selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical
object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant
background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence
Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and
a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2)
Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects
object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object
information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a
model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse
downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point
cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&A methods rely on explicit program execution, where
the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the
scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit
program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across
multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing
implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question
words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring
a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a
program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion
representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing
both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module
iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program
functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly
constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability
across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the
recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating
potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image
classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying
subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper
presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates
local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By
employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained
local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive
understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention
mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the
risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust
performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in melanoma detection, achieving higher accuracy and
better resilience against false positives. This work lays the foundation for
future research in automated skin cancer recognition and highlights the
effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于二维函数和Quasi-Fresnel变换的非视距（NLOS）成像新方法，显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将测量数据和隐藏场景建模为三维，忽略了隐藏场景的二维特性，导致高计算成本和内存消耗，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用二维函数表示隐藏场景，并采用Quasi-Fresnel变换建立测量数据与隐藏场景的直接反演公式。

Result: 相比现有方法，新方法将运行时间和内存需求降低数个数量级，同时保持成像质量。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了计算效率，使轻量级设备（如移动和嵌入式系统）实现实时高分辨率NLOS成像成为可能。

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by
analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically
model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions,
overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This
oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption,
limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS
imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and
employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula
between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation
leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly
reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm
efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional
aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal
memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and
memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging
quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances
computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices
such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will
facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its
applicability across a wider range of platforms.

*Kyungmin Jo,Jooyeol Yun,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的自注意力修改方法（Stratified Attention），解决了现有图像提示生成方法中的冲突问题，并平衡了生成图像的逼真度与图像提示的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在捕捉细节（如纹理）时表现不足，导致用户意图无法准确反映。图像提示方法虽能改善这一问题，但存在分类器自由引导中的冲突信号以及逼真度与对齐的权衡问题。

Method: 提出冲突自由引导（conflict-free guidance），仅将图像提示作为期望条件；并设计分层注意力（Stratified Attention），联合使用生成图像和图像提示的键值，而非二选一。

Result: 在三个图像生成任务上的实验表明，该方法在忠实反映图像提示方面优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 通过冲突自由引导和分层注意力，本文方法显著提升了图像提示生成的质量和准确性。

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of
high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to
capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from
being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images
conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work
modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated
images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.
This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,
generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two
common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate
images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches
neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.
Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired
conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve
this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired
conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image
prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention
modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image
and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and
values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the
generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new
self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys
and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through
extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the
proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully
reflecting the image prompt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对ADVLMs的性能评估主要局限于静态输入的开环设置，缺乏对交互行为和实际安全性的闭环评估。

Method: 设计了Bench2ADVLM框架，包括双系统适应架构、物理控制抽象层和自反式场景生成模块，支持从仿真到物理平台的闭环测试。

Result: 实验表明，现有ADVLMs在闭环条件下表现有限，验证了框架的诊断能力。

Conclusion: Bench2ADVLM为ADVLMs的闭环评估提供了统一且全面的解决方案，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols
for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop
settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative
closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,
and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified
hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive
assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by
dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation
environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,
heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast
system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into
standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To
bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control
abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level
actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs
on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM
introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically
explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for
safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a
hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract
reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution.
Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and
physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing
that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protego是一种用户中心的隐私保护方法，通过动态变形3D面具保护面部图像，防止基于检索的隐私侵犯，显著降低面部识别模型的检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对面部识别技术滥用带来的隐私威胁，如未经同意的身份推断和数字足迹暴露。

Method: 将用户的3D面部特征封装为姿态不变的2D表示，动态变形为自然外观的3D面具，应用于在线共享前的图像。

Result: 实验表明，Protego显著降低黑盒面部识别模型的检索准确性，性能至少优于现有方法2倍，并提供前所未有的视觉一致性。

Conclusion: Protego为对抗面部识别技术的滥用（如大规模监控和非自愿身份追踪）提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale
image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like
Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a
large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only
enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as
social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their
consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a
user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such
retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial
signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically
deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of
any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by
a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of
FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.
Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a
wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing
methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video
settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,
Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance
and unsolicited identity tracing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLMs在动态时空交互理解上存在显著缺陷，无法像人类一样轻松跟踪和推理物体的运动、旋转和视角变化。

Method: 提出VLM4D基准测试，包含多样化的真实和合成视频及精心设计的问题-答案对，评估VLMs的时空推理能力。

Result: 评估显示现有VLMs在整合多视觉线索和保持时间连贯性方面表现不佳，与人类基准差距显著。

Conclusion: 通过4D特征场重建和针对性监督微调等方法，有望提升VLMs的时空理解能力，推动动态环境下的视觉智能发展。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track
and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities
essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in
current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of
VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos
accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing
translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion
continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADDiff-Dose是一种基于条件扩散模型的放疗剂量预测方法，显著提升了预测精度和临床适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法在放疗剂量预测中泛化性差、精度不足和临床适用性有限的问题。

Method: 采用LightweightVAE3D压缩CT数据，结合多模态输入和渐进噪声去噪框架，使用多头注意力机制和复合损失函数。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，MAE为0.101-0.154，DICE系数0.927，计划生成时间降至22秒。

Conclusion: ADDiff-Dose为放疗剂量预测提供了高效、通用的解决方案，显著提升临床效率。

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商背景生成任务面临产品一致性和精确控制的挑战，现有方法因缺乏领域数据和仅依赖文本提示而效果不佳。

Method: 基于高质量数据集DreamEcom-400K，提出DreamPainter框架，整合文本提示和参考图像信息作为控制信号。

Result: 实验表明，DreamPainter在保持产品一致性和整合多模态信息方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamPainter为电商背景生成提供了高效解决方案，结合文本和视觉信息实现精确控制。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集（如Mapillary）的标注粒度较粗，无法区分语义重要的交通标志类型，影响了自动驾驶决策的准确性。

Method: 从Mapillary数据集中提取并手动标注细粒度交通标志类别，构建MVV数据集，并对比评估DINOv2与多种视觉语言模型（VLM）的性能。

Result: DINOv2在交通标志识别及其他类别（如车辆和行人）上均优于其他VLM基线模型。

Conclusion: MVV数据集和DINOv2为自动驾驶场景中的细粒度视觉理解提供了可靠基准，推动了更可解释和可扩展的感知系统发展。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical
for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used
datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without
distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit
signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived
from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs
(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically
meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has
been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further,
we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2
model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM
baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented
categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant
limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual
understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic
matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework
pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

Motivation: 现有自监督预训练方法因点区分难度不足导致模型崩溃和结构信息缺失，影响表达可靠性和性能。

Method: 提出GaussianCross，结合3D高斯展开技术，将点云转换为统一的高斯表示，并引入三属性自适应蒸馏展开模块构建3D特征场。

Conclusion: GaussianCross通过跨模态一致性特征捕获，有效解决了现有问题，并在多个任务中展示了优越性能。

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层级联框架（HCF），用于分布式多阶段图像压缩，通过潜在空间转换提高效率，并在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式多阶段图像压缩中计算资源利用不足、重复压缩导致的效率低下和质量损失问题。

Method: 采用分层级联框架（HCF）和策略驱动的量化控制，通过潜在空间转换优化率失真权衡。

Result: 在多个数据集上，HCF在PSNR和计算效率上显著优于现有方法，最高提升0.6dB PSNR，节省97.8% FLOPs。

Conclusion: HCF在分布式图像压缩中实现了高效性和灵活性，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses
multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses
challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize
available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain
operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency;
fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we
developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high
rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct
latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage
image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization
control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge
quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration
based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other
configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and
CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up
to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU
memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art
progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables
retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on
CLIC2020-mobile.

Result: 在基准数据集上，StarPose优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和时间一致性。

Conclusion: StarPose通过自回归扩散和时空物理指导，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的性能，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent
depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on
Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based
approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic
nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often
fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted
frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in
predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes
StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates
historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to
significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose
predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose
mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating
previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose
Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative
historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring
temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play
Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the
denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial
anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and
realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation. Code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于泰勒展开的动态缓存机制，用于加速扩散变换器（DiTs）的推理速度，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiTs）在视觉生成任务中表现优异，但推理速度较慢，限制了其在低资源应用中的部署。现有方法存在内存和计算开销大、预测准确性不稳定的问题。

Method: 将泰勒预测目标从模块级转移到最后一个块级，减少缓存特征数量；利用第一块的预测误差动态调整缓存机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在FLUX、DiT和Wan Video上分别实现了3.17倍、2.36倍和4.14倍的加速，且质量损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 提出的动态缓存机制在速度和生成质量之间取得了更好的平衡，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自由文本报告存在冗余和语言不一致问题，结构化报告（S-RRG）能提供标准化、简洁的格式，但现有方法依赖预定义标签或模板，限制了表达性和临床细节。

Method: 构建了MIMIC-STRUC数据集，包含疾病名称、严重程度等临床相关结构化信息；训练基于LLM的模型生成标准化报告；提出S-Score评估指标。

Result: 新方法生成高质量结构化报告，S-Score评估指标更符合临床需求，与人工评估更一致。

Conclusion: 结构化报告和定制评估指标对S-RRG至关重要，提供了更临床相关的报告质量衡量标准。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest
X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional
free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,
complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology
report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information
into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on
classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require
predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based
approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence
patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important
details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes
dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation
framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that
includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical
locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and
well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,
high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized
evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy
but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a
clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements
critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with
human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured
reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing
a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在实时响应、物理可行性和安全性之间的冲突，以支持沉浸式人机交互。

Method: 采用自回归反应扩散规划器实时预测动作与反应，并结合强化学习的运动跟踪策略。

Result: 在Inter-X和InterHuman数据集上显著提升了运动质量、交互连续性和物理合理性。

Conclusion: Human-X框架在虚拟现实和机器人交互中展示了推动人机协作的潜力。

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a
critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While
existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they
often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness,
physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine
interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable
immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities,
including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike
existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our
method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an
auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization
and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we
integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement
learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while
avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on
the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in
motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over
state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world
applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction,
showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过语义驱动的LoRA检索和动态聚合解决LoRA模块部署中的三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LoRA在模型定制中表现出色，但其实际部署面临稀疏元数据标注、零样本适应能力和多LoRA融合策略不足的问题。

Method: 框架包含两部分：基于权重编码的LoRA检索器和细粒度门控融合机制，实现语义驱动的LoRA检索与动态融合。

Result: 显著提升了图像生成性能，支持基础模型的高效扩展。

Conclusion: 该工作为社区开发的LoRA模块与实际部署需求之间建立了桥梁，推动了标准化适配器集成的协作模型演进。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through
large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment
of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to
parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated
efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the
effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three
critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot
adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion
strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key
components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared
semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating
dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion
mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers
and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during
generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation
perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of
foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the
fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment
requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized
adapter integration.

TL;DR: DeflareMamba提出了一种基于状态空间模型的镜头光晕去除方法，通过分层框架和局部增强的状态空间模型，有效去除光晕并保持图像背景的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 镜头光晕去除因光晕与背景信息混淆而具有挑战性，现有方法在保持上下文一致性方面表现不佳。

Method: 采用分层框架和局部增强的状态空间模型，通过变步长采样模式建立长距离像素关联，同时保留局部细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效去除多种光晕，并保持非光晕区域的自然外观，提升下游视觉任务性能。

Conclusion: DeflareMamba首次将状态空间模型引入光晕去除任务，表现出色且具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the
underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical
interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have
shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to
maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare
removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages
the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while
maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we
design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations
through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space
models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the
flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and
reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare
regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method
to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

Method: 通过摄像头推断道路布局来解释雷达点云数据，实现空间场景重建。

Result: 在真实车辆上进行的实验验证了方法的有效性，数据集显示其在实际NLoS驾驶环境中的适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法结合雷达和摄像头数据，有效提升了非视距区域行人的定位能力。

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态检测框架NRE-Net，通过融合RGB图像、事件流和单目预测的法线图，显著提升了恶劣光照条件下的物体检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣光照条件下的物体检测对自动驾驶等应用至关重要，但现有方法（RGB或事件数据单独使用）难以应对反射等干扰。

Method: NRE-Net结合RGB图像、事件流和法线图，通过自适应双流融合模块（ADFM）和事件模态感知融合模块（EAFM）优化多模态融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det-sub和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，NRE-Net的mAP50分别比现有方法提升了7.9%和6.1%。

Conclusion: NRE-Net通过多模态融合有效抑制了虚假检测，显著提升了恶劣光照条件下的检测性能。

Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event
cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often
induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which
frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event
data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these
issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from
monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and
enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection
framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly
predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the
fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive
Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,
and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high
dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the
DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements
of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing
the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by
7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动方法依赖高质量配对数据且存在声学与唇部运动映射的模糊性，限制了其可扩展性和鲁棒性。Text2Lip旨在通过文本输入和音素-视觉桥梁解决这些问题。

Method: 采用音素序列作为中间表示，设计渐进式音素-音频替换策略，并通过跨模态注意力增强音素特征，最终通过地标引导的渲染器生成逼真视频。

Result: Text2Lip在语义保真度、视觉真实性和模态鲁棒性上优于现有方法，实现了可控且灵活的说话人脸生成。

Conclusion: Text2Lip为说话人脸生成提供了新范式，适用于有音频和无音频场景。

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a
landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate
lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms
existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality
robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking
face generation. Our project homepage is https://plyon1.github.io/Text2Lip/.

Motivation: 当前方法依赖预校准物体轨迹或难以从欠采样捕获中准确建模快速移动物体，存在时间不连续性问题。

Method: 结合视频扩散模型提取时间一致性先验，引入联合时间戳优化策略和不确定性蒸馏方法。

Result: 实验表明，新方法显著提升动态建模效果，PSNR增益约2 dB。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了动态场景建模中的时间不连续性问题，提升了快速移动物体的建模精度。

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad
applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or
Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity
novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem
from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately
modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to
challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our
key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time
adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective
integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a
joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses,
and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content
while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for
fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view
synthesis over baseline approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于感知的神经质量度量方法，用于直接评估BRDF模型的质量，无需渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BRDF空间度量方法无法捕捉渲染图像中的感知差异，需要一种更准确的评估方式。

Method: 使用多层感知器（MLP）训练，输入参考和近似BRDF样本，预测感知质量（JOD分数）。

Result: 神经度量与人类判断的相关性显著高于现有BRDF空间度量。

Conclusion: 该度量方法为BRDF模型评估提供了基于感知的替代方案，但在BRDF拟合中性能有限。

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional
BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture
perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce
the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that
operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during
quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with
synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated
image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and
approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of
just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric
achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing
BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting
remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative
for evaluating BRDF models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LWD检测方法缺乏标准化，且对不同植物特性和环境条件的适应性不足，导致精度和鲁棒性较低。

Method: Hydra结合毫米波雷达和摄像头，使用CNN融合多模态数据，并通过Transformer编码器生成特征图，最终通过分类器检测叶片湿润状态。

Result: 实验表明，Hydra在多种场景下分类叶片湿润的准确率高达96%，在恶劣环境下仍能保持约90%的准确率。

Conclusion: Hydra展示了在真实农业环境中高精度检测LWD的潜力，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

Motivation: 现有视频多模态大语言模型因上下文长度限制，在长视频场景中表现不佳，需要高效且不牺牲特征粒度的方法。

Method: Free-MoRef将视觉令牌重构为多个短序列作为多参考，引入MoRef-attention并行收集线索，并通过参考融合步骤合成最终推理序列。

Result: 在多个数据集上，Free-MoRef实现了对2倍至8倍长输入帧的全面感知，性能显著提升且计算成本低。

Conclusion: Free-MoRef在高效性和有效性上表现出色，甚至超越专门训练的长视频模型。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable
advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context
length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically
exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended
input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference
techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.
Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame
inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach
\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception
capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef
reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as
multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers
clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query
activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is
derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from
parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that
are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token
sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing
costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency
and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that
Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input
frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant
responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing
dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on

Conclusion: 航拍图像是自动驾驶系统中可扩展且适应性强的环境上下文来源，AID4AD数据集的发布将推动相关研究。

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery
into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution,
we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes
dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local
coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps
provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and
nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an
alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A
manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set
of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future
research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of
AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery
serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion
prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that
replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a
15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory
prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery
as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated
vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are
unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation
code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in

Result: 在Gait3D和GREW数据集上分别达到77.8和80.4的rank-1准确率，仅使用10.3M参数。

Conclusion: TrackletGait在复杂场景中表现出色，为步态识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and
walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep
learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite
challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic
gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and
occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges
in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing
sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation
in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based
Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we
present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality
silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and
GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.
Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors
affecting gait recognition in the wild.

TL;DR: AURORA框架通过结构化思维链提示和特征蒸馏损失提升参考音频-视觉分割任务的语义理解和分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏真正的语义理解，且联合训练推理和分割会降低像素级精度。

Method: 采用思维链提示机制和特征蒸馏损失，结合两阶段训练策略（自校正和强化学习）。

Result: AURORA在Ref-AVS基准测试中达到最优性能，并能泛化到无参考分割任务。

Conclusion: AURORA通过增强推理能力和语言理解，显著提升了参考音频-视觉分割的性能。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to
precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual
cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to
memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning
and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues,
we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning
and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a
structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model
through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation
feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities
without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's
genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training
strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes
self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by
reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster
robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes
effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

*Die Chen,Zhongjie Duan,Zhiwen Li,Cen Chen,Daoyuan Chen,Yaliang Li,Yinda Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriCtrl是一个即插即用的框架，用于精确连续控制生成图像的美学属性，解决了现有方法依赖模糊文本提示或高成本人类偏好数据的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在美学属性的细粒度控制上存在不足，文本提示模糊且依赖高成本数据，限制了实用性和扩展性。

Method: 通过预训练的视觉语言模型量化美学语义，并设计轻量级值编码器将标量强度映射为可学习嵌入，实现连续控制。

Result: 实验表明，AttriCtrl能精确控制单个属性和灵活组合多属性，兼容性强，适用于多样化生成场景。

Conclusion: AttriCtrl提供了一种高效、直观的美学控制方法，具有实际应用价值和广泛的兼容性。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated
images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains
challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific
adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are
inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired
intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting
their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose
AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of
aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by
leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and
employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to
learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables
intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training
overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over
individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.
Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable
generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical
utility across diverse generation scenarios.

Result: 在无噪声图像上表现与ADMM方法相当，在高斯噪声污染图像上去噪效果更优。

Conclusion: 新方法在效率和性能上优于传统ADMM方法，尤其在噪声处理方面表现突出。

Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse
representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of
image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The
content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and
convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve
the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient
optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty
parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection
may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a
novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,
which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,
and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total
variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to
solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the
corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the
proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based
approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution
image.

Method: 使用神经网格模型结合多模型RANSAC，统一检测和姿态估计。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上，平均提升了22.9%的性能，且鲁棒性更强。

Conclusion: 统一框架在RGB图像上的表现优于传统方法，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require
determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on
RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches
that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation.
For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and
pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural
mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275,
improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all
scale-agnostic metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our unified method
exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and
models are available at

TL;DR: CL3AN是一个大规模高分辨率数据集，用于在多色光源下恢复图像到环境归一化状态，提出了一种基于Retinex模型的学习框架，解决了现有方法在光照分解上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设单一光源或均匀光照，无法处理复杂光照场景中的反射和阴影效应，导致图像恢复时出现不一致性、纹理泄漏和颜色失真。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的学习框架，利用显式色度和亮度分量指导，基于Retinex模型原理，实现光照与反射的精确分解。

Result: 在现有基准和CL3AN数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在非均匀彩色光照和材料特定反射变化下表现出更强的鲁棒性，同时保持计算成本竞争力。

Conclusion: CL3AN数据集和提出的学习框架为复杂光照场景下的图像恢复提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了现有技术的性能。

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored
light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce
intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often
oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,
white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this
paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of
its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under
multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.
Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,
such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,
primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination
from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired
decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit
chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the
principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks
and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing
enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific
reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive
computational cost. The benchmark, codes, and models are available at

Result: 成功识别并去标识化敏感信息（如姓名、病史、个人数据等）。

Conclusion: 开发的Python算法灵活且实用，适用于日常使用和研究，代码已开源。

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations
in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research.
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying
Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy
rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct
identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to
be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit
to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on
the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we
implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our
algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly
de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information,
like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully
recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to
classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the
use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the
entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire
program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake视频的传播引发信任危机，现有方法缺乏对弱监督多模态细粒度时序伪造定位（WS-MTFL）的系统研究。

Method: 结合视觉和音频模态检测作为二分类任务，采用多任务学习框架，并引入专家混合结构及特征增强模块。

Result: WMMT在WS-MTFL中表现优异，多项指标接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: 多任务学习对WS-MTFL有效，WMMT在弱监督下实现了高精度定位与检测。

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social
stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the
challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of
systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal
forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly
supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning
(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT
achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial
forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual
and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.
The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a
multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to
adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving
excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature
enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is
proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and
construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal
information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving
loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent
segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for
WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化模型在动态环境中性能下降严重，现有TTA方法因依赖梯度反向传播而不适用于量化模型。

Method: 提出ZOA框架，仅需两次前向传播实现高效适应，并设计域知识管理方案以减少干扰。

Result: 在量化W6A6 ViT-B模型上，ZOA在ImageNet-C数据集上比现有方法提升5.0%。

Conclusion: ZOA为量化模型的TTA提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to
speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous
driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance
degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this
degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision
counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To
address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an
effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.
Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models
as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is
unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory
and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to
improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a
continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model
adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden
of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme
to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory
consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and
fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental
results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based
and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized
model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve
a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The
source code is available at https://github.com/DengZeshuai/ZOA.

*Yanyun Wang,Li Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的对抗训练方法（RPAT），通过优化感知一致性来缓解干净准确性和对抗鲁棒性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗训练（AT）在提升模型鲁棒性的同时会降低干净准确率，作者发现这是由于对困难对抗样本的过度学习导致决策边界退化。

Method: 提出了一种名为Robust Perception的新目标，鼓励模型感知随输入扰动平滑变化，并基于此设计了RPAT方法。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的实验表明，RPAT优于4种常见基线和12种SOTA方法。

Conclusion: RPAT通过优化感知一致性，有效缓解了准确性和鲁棒性的权衡问题，为对抗训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off
between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed
to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning
of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact
for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard
adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already
learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous
views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard
adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the
trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception
consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore
the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a
smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its
establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT
objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change
smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust
Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the
current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12
state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. The code is available at

TL;DR: CAM（内容自适应Mamba）通过动态SSM改进LIC，引入内容感知令牌重组和全局先验，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Mamba模型因固定扫描方式无法动态利用内容依赖，限制了全局依赖的捕捉。

Method: CAM采用内容感知令牌重组和全局先验集成，优化SSM的动态性和全局依赖捕捉。

Result: CMIC模型在多个基准测试中BD-rate显著优于VTM-21.0。

Conclusion: CAM通过动态SSM显著提升LIC性能，成为当前最优方法。

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space
models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However,
vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective
scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content
dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that
addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token
reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to
prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it
integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively
mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions
of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies
while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive
Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on
Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

Result: 在七个WSI数据集上表现优于现有持续学习框架，具有更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: COSFormer是临床应用中WSI分析的强大解决方案。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue
structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and
computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the
rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need
for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing
models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a
system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study,
we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework
tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn
sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical
datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering
seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and
task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior
generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning
frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in
clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围、高时间分辨率和抗运动模糊等优势，但需要高效方法从异步事件流中提取信息以实现机载应用。

Method: ESI通过单次积分事件流并结合增强衰减算法，实现实时强度图像重建。

Result: ESI在运行效率、重建质量和帧率上优于现有算法，显著提升了无人机在恶劣视觉环境下的感知能力。

Conclusion: ESI方法在低光照条件下表现出色，适用于无人机机载视觉跟踪，解决了其他算法因帧率不足或实时性能差而失败的问题。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range,
high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly
promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and
utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential
for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a
streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single
integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method
guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to
event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.
The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single
integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.
Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,
typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits
onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking
scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency
improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a
result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual
adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance
for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination
conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to
insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在图像数据冗余和视觉特征一次性提取上的不足。

Method: 采用文本优先策略，结合多轮迭代整合关键视觉线索。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上性能分别提升3.2%、5.1%和1.6%。

Conclusion: I2CR框架显著优于现有方法，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at

Motivation: 减轻标注负担，提升伪标签的可靠性。

Method: 采用导数标签传播技术，对像素级特征向量施加离散导数操作作为额外正则化。

Result: 实验验证了设计的合理性，并展示了优于其他方法的性能。

Conclusion: DerProp通过严格正则化的相似性度量，有效解决了伪标签不可靠的问题。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of
labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While
pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for
enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised
framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation
to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes
discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional
regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics.
Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical
similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the
solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality
of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are
available at https://github.com/ForawardStar/DerProp/.

TL;DR: Patho-AgenticRAG是一个多模态RAG框架，通过结合文本和图像检索解决病理学VLMs中的幻觉问题，显著提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学中的视觉语言模型（VLMs）因超高分辨率、复杂组织结构和临床语义的细微差异，容易产生幻觉输出，影响临床信任。现有RAG方法依赖文本知识库，无法充分利用视觉线索。

Method: 提出Patho-AgenticRAG，基于权威病理学教材的页面级嵌入构建多模态数据库，支持联合文本-图像检索，避免关键图像信息丢失，并支持推理、任务分解和多轮搜索交互。

Result: 实验表明，Patho-AgenticRAG在多选题诊断和视觉问答等复杂病理任务中显著优于现有多模态模型。

Conclusion: Patho-AgenticRAG通过多模态检索和推理能力，有效解决了病理学VLMs的幻觉问题，提升了诊断准确性。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in
medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high
resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These
factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs
inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing
RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,
limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we
propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on
page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike
traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search,
enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text
and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based

*Rui Qian,Haozhi Cao,Tianchen Deng,Shenghai Yuan,Lihua Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatSSC提出了一种基于深度引导初始化策略和高斯聚合器的新框架，解决了单目3D语义场景补全任务中随机初始化高斯原语的低效性和异常问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D语义场景补全（SSC）任务需要从单张图像推断密集的几何和语义信息，但现有方法依赖随机初始化高斯原语，导致效率低下和异常问题。

Method: SplatSSC采用深度引导初始化策略（GMF模块）生成稀疏且具有代表性的高斯原语，并通过解耦高斯聚合器（DGA）在几何和语义预测中增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在Occ-ScanNet数据集上，SplatSSC在IoU和mIoU上分别超过先前方法6.3%和4.1%，同时降低了9.3%的延迟和内存消耗。

Conclusion: SplatSSC通过深度引导初始化和解耦高斯聚合器，显著提升了单目3D语义场景补全的性能和效率。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising
task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene
from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly
improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still
rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which
inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier
primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose
SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided
initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random
initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a
Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image
and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial
Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the
Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing
geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting
process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming
prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both
latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released
upon acceptance.

*Peng Zhang,Zhihui Lai,Heng Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Hermes的半监督双阈值对比学习策略，用于超声图像分类和分割，解决了伪标签选择中的过度自信和任务独立性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于置信度的伪标签选择容易产生过度自信但错误的预测，且分割和分类任务未充分探索关联性，影响了半监督对比学习的性能。

Method: 提出双阈值对比学习策略，结合对比学习和半监督学习，开发了跨任务注意力和显著性模块，设计了一致性学习策略以减少特征差异。

Result: 在多个超声数据集上的实验表明，Hermes在半监督设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Hermes通过跨任务信息共享和一致性学习，显著提升了超声图像分类和分割的性能。

Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident
yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and
overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily
degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover,
segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the
affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for
ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy
combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning,
where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional
guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also
developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and
classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy
is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative
transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly
available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid
ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound
datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised
settings.

TL;DR: SGAD提出了一种新的语义和几何感知描述符网络，通过直接匹配高区分度的区域描述符，显著提升了匹配的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于A2PM的方法依赖低效的像素级比较和复杂的图匹配，限制了可扩展性。

Method: SGAD通过生成高区分度的区域描述符，避免了复杂的图优化，并采用分类和排序子任务的新型监督策略。HCRF用于消除重叠区域。

Result: SGAD将运行时间减少60倍（0.82s vs. 60.23s），在户外姿态估计中表现优于DKM（65.98 vs. 61.11），在室内姿态估计中AUC@5°提升7.39%。

Conclusion: SGAD通过创新方法显著提升了匹配性能，成为新的SOTA。

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy.
However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient
pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In
this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network
(SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly
discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex
graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and
efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area
matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching
task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the
Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping
areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance
gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive
evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers:
SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy
(0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA
delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new
state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: 研究了边缘增强预训练对医学图像分割模型跨模态性能的影响，并提出了一种基于元学习的策略来选择最佳预训练方法，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对疾病诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但现有方法在跨模态性能上存在不足，尤其是边缘信息在预训练中的作用未被系统研究。

Method: 通过使用边缘核（如kirsch）预处理数据，训练两种版本的预训练模型（原始数据和边缘增强数据），并在多种医学影像模态上微调。提出元学习策略，根据原始图像的标准差和熵选择最佳预训练模型。

Result: 边缘增强预训练在不同模态上表现不一，而元学习策略显著提升了整体分割性能（比仅边缘增强预训练高16.42%，比仅原始数据预训练高19.30%）。

Conclusion: 边缘增强预训练需选择性应用，元学习策略能有效优化模型选择，提升跨模态医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

Motivation: 传统LiDAR和RGB相机在高速场景中存在感知间隙，而现有结合事件相机的方法依赖同步传感器，难以应对快速运动场景。

Method: 提出仅使用事件相机的立体3D检测框架，引入双滤波器机制提取语义和几何信息，并通过目标中心信息对齐边界框增强回归。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在动态环境中优于现有方法，验证了事件相机在连续时间3D感知中的潜力。

Conclusion: 事件相机在3D物体检测中具有潜力，尤其是在高速动态场景中，无需依赖传统3D传感器。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise
localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely
used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios.
Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution,
offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which
integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time
detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on
synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework
that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D
sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in
event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both.
Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with
object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior
approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event
cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督异常检测假设训练数据均为正常样本，需人工筛选，引入偏差且适应性差。

Method: CoMet结合Soft Confident Learning（为低置信度样本分配低权重）和Meta-Learning（通过训练验证损失协方差正则化更新），防止过拟合并增强对噪声数据的鲁棒性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD、VIADUCT和KSDD2数据集上，CoMet优于基线方法，对训练集中的异常不敏感，并在所有数据集上达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: CoMet是一种模型无关的方法，可应用于任何基于梯度下降的异常检测模型，显著提升性能。

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all
datasets.

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

Motivation: AI在医疗中的应用需要安全可靠，但面临数据分布变化等挑战，研究旨在比较不确定性量化方法与学习延迟模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过大型眼科数据集，评估学习延迟模型和不确定性量化方法在分布内和分布外的性能，特别是青光眼分类和错误案例延迟能力。

Result: 不确定性量化方法在延迟决策上表现优于学习延迟模型，更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化方法可能是AI延迟决策的更优选择。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve
patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating
human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety
is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are
likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that
learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal
trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during
clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift.
Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does
not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that
models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution
(OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised
fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation
study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models
and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance
in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to
accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a
high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may
be a promising choice for AI deferral.

Conclusion: 逻辑驱动的约束有效提升了零样本组合动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen
verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of
verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's
progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional
structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)
Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and
impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like
symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by
explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To
this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates
dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical
Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the
compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The
latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,
empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing
these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network
architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic
abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset
demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving
the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

Motivation: 解决复杂文本渲染和图像编辑一致性的挑战。

Method: 采用大规模数据收集、过滤、标注、合成和平衡的数据管道，以及渐进式训练策略；改进多任务训练范式，包括T2I、TI2I和I2I任务。

Result: 在字母语言（如英语）和象形文字语言（如中文）中表现优异，图像编辑一致性和视觉保真度显著提升。

Conclusion: Qwen-Image在图像生成和编辑方面达到最先进水平，展示了强大的能力。

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning
vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual
comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework
that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations.
Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for
image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs.
Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model
to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly,
CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional
encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP
benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without
compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and
retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into
Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations
and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable
potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with
comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding
of VLMs.

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical
($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation
maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit
computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation
space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier
contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between
two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing
spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as
discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as
a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).
Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment
algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit
vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical
Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a
hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two
methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in
correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x
more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with
outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new
dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.
"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud
Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

Conclusion: LPD通过多样化空间和损失设计，显著提升了视频搜索的全面性和多样性。

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces

TL;DR: OTIP是一种基于最优传输理论的零样本框架，用于在整流流模型中实现图像反转，平衡重建保真度和编辑灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像反转中重建保真度与编辑灵活性之间的平衡问题。

Method: 利用最优传输理论指导反转过程，通过轨迹优化平衡重建精度和编辑可控性。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，重建损失显著降低，身份保存和感知质量提升。

Conclusion: OTIP在图像编辑任务中表现出色，兼具高保真重建和高效计算。

Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to
editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing
applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work,
we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot
framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion
process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that
incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can
effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through
principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths
between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS
scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating
superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We
evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%
improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and
LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method
achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement
in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to
baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling
edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation
across diverse editing scenarios. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了TRUDI数据集和TITUS管道，用于识别港口物流中的运输单元（TUs），解决了缺乏公开基准数据集的问题，并在多样化条件下验证了其可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 港口物流中运输单元的识别效率低下，缺乏公开的多样化基准数据集阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 提出TRUDI数据集（35,034个标注实例）和TITUS管道（三阶段：分割、ID定位、识别验证）。

Result: TITUS在多样化视角和环境下可靠识别TUs，优于依赖特定场景的系统。

Conclusion: TRUDI数据集和TITUS管道为港口物流数字化提供了基准，提升了物流链效率。

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the
efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered
by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity
and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present
the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated
instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,
and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based
and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.
For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric
ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that
operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the
location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.
Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera
angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably
identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and
weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide
a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new
approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in
multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics
chains.

Conclusion: Uni-Layout通过统一生成与评估，结合人类反馈，实现了更高效的布局生成与测量。

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

Conclusion: SMART-Ship数据集为多模态遥感解释任务提供了有力支持，并指明了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal
remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation.
However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of
multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset
for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered
images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities:
visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral,
and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image
sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and
registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are
annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories,
instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically
to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized
benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative
methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the
proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation
tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动无监督对象定位领域的发展，提供一种无需依赖聚类或复杂后处理的简单方法。

Method: 使用CutOnce生成粗伪标签，通过自训练优化检测器，无需专门设计的损失函数。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有最先进的无监督方法。

Conclusion: COLER是一种有效的零样本无监督模型，有望推动无监督对象定位的进展。

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised
instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed
CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn
from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on
any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image.
We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce
to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models,
but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER
achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions
for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through
self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method
can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformers（ViTs）的AI方法，直接从MRI图像预测胶质母细胞瘤患者的总生存期（OS），无需肿瘤分割，简化了工作流程并减少了计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤是一种高度侵袭性的脑肿瘤，中位生存期仅10-15个月。预测OS对个性化治疗策略和临床决策至关重要。

Method: 利用ViTs直接从MRI图像提取特征，避免了传统方法中的肿瘤分割步骤。

Result: 在BRATS数据集上测试，准确率达到62.5%，在精确率、召回率和F1分数上表现均衡，优于其他模型。

Conclusion: ViTs在医学影像任务中具有潜力，为高效且无需分割的OS预测模型奠定了基础，但数据集规模限制了其泛化能力。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a
median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical
for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with
patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,
exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from
MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional
approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational
resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy
of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.
Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,
and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size
limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets
compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is
observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability
of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for
OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on
segmentation.

Result: 在LRW和LRW1000数据集上分别达到92.0%和60.7%的Top-1准确率，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InfoSyncNet通过创新设计和训练策略，显著提升了无声视频语音估计的准确性，为相关应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in
Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately
mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges
due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information
within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform
sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques.
Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between
the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and
effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data.
Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the
model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's
orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm
the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of
92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

TL;DR: SAMPO通过偏好优化教视觉基础模型从稀疏视觉交互中推断高级类别意图，显著提升了稀疏提示下的多对象分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础模型（如SAM）在密集同质对象分割中因意图差距导致的性能不足问题。

Method: 提出SAMPO框架，通过偏好优化隐式捕捉目标类别特征，不依赖语言模型。

Result: 在三个医学分割任务中表现优异，仅用10%训练数据即超越所有基线方法，提升9个百分点。

Conclusion: SAMPO为视觉基础模型提供了一种新的意图感知对齐范式，无需辅助提示生成器或语言模型。

Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable
segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly
prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances
implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense
homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual
prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations
impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO
(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that
teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from
sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO
optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through
preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on
language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse
prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.
Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned
with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing
methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9
percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing
dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted
preference learning.

Motivation: 现有方法在多类图像异常检测中性能不足，尤其是在类别标签使用方式上缺乏研究，影响了检测阈值的定义。

Method: 提出了HierCore框架，利用分层记忆库估计类别的决策标准，无需类别标签即可有效工作。

Result: 实验表明，HierCore在所有四种场景下均满足需求，性能稳定且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierCore在多类图像异常检测中具有实际应用潜力，能够适应不同类别标签的使用情况。

Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised
learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,
aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single
model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to
class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,
previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.
However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively
understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined
in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether
class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In
this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image
anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on
whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then
re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy
all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class
labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision
criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and
robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,
determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and
evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore
consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance
across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world
multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: FMS通过全面监督策略有效提升了多模态篡改检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$)
is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary
classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content
localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods
are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference
caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive
forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we
present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates
modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal
supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For
modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised
Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the
multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we
propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies
the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from
both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision,
we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It
utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception
from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the
interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual
cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current
methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the
multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces
fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal
resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and
the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI
video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor
module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.
(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual
descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging
high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from
existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation
studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic
captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP
similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI
reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through
explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，EFA-GS显著减少伪影，PSNR提升1.68 dB，同时保留高频细节。

Conclusion: EFA-GS有效减少浮动物体伪影，适用于下游3D编辑任务，代码将开源。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient
representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often
produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the
actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying
mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization
scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the
origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify
under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we
propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),
which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate
low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based
and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,
effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating
artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of
1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our
implementation will be released on GitHub.

Motivation: 透明物体的光学特性导致深度相机生成不完整或无效的深度数据，影响机器人抓取的准确性和可靠性。现有方法依赖模型隐式推断深度值的可靠性，但泛化能力不足。

Method: 通过实例掩码明确区分透明与非透明区域，结合单目深度估计提供上下文信息，专注于透明区域的深度估计学习。

Result: 在基准数据集和真实场景中，ReMake均优于现有方法，表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReMake通过显式监督和上下文增强，有效解决了透明物体深度补全问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras
to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the
accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically
input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,
expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.
However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to
highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,
we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance
mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent
regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on
learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during
training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and
improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth
estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its
surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization
capability. Code and videos are available at

Conclusion: LMMs在视频参与度预测中具有潜力，音频特征的整合能显著提升性能，模型集成进一步优化了预测效果。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video
platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for
optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this
task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as
semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.
Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different
modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,
but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality
interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large
multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two
representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language
modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.
Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based
metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames
and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models
demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,
showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably,
VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of
audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our
method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on
short-form video engagement prediction. The code is available at

### [407] [Understanding the Risks of Asphalt Art on the Reliability of Surveillance Perception Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02530)
*Jin Ma,Abyad Enan,Long Cheng,Mashrur Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了艺术斑马线对预训练视觉目标检测模型行人检测性能的影响，发现复杂艺术图案会显著降低检测性能，且恶意设计的图案可能被利用来干扰检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术斑马线旨在提升行人安全和可见性，但其视觉复杂性可能干扰依赖视觉的监控系统。

Method: 通过将不同街头艺术图案合成到固定监控场景中，评估模型在正常和恶意设计斑马线下的行人检测性能。

Result: 复杂艺术图案显著降低检测性能，恶意设计的图案可故意隐藏真实行人或生成虚假检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了城市视觉监控系统的潜在漏洞，强调了在设计鲁棒行人感知模型时需考虑环境视觉变化的重要性。

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different
organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of
pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance
systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we
investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a
pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic
crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed
surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting
pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial
conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing
normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or
altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while
simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,
particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade
pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real
pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings
highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian
surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for
environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception
models.

*Abyad Enan,Jon C Calhoun,Mashrur Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAVC框架动态调整视频压缩级别，根据天气和光照条件优化带宽使用，提升车辆检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能交通系统中因带宽限制导致的实时性能问题，同时减少视频压缩对车辆检测精度的影响。

Method: 使用PAVC框架，动态调整视频压缩级别以适应环境变化，传输至处理单元进行车辆检测。

Result: PAVC提升车辆检测精度13%，在中等带宽下减少带宽需求8.23倍，在极低带宽下减少72倍。

Conclusion: PAVC有效平衡带宽需求和检测精度，适用于智能交通系统的实时应用。

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation
systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras
that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the
same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the
available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can
lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS
applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be
used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.
This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely
on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is
influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,
suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response
to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called
Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera
captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits
them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for
safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The
system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather
and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing
bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection
accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to
8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations
with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to
72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

### [409] [MonoDream: Monocular Vision-Language Navigation with Panoramic Dreaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02549)
*Shuo Wang,Yongcai Wang,Wanting Li,Yucheng Wang,Maiyue Chen,Kaihui Wang,Zhizhong Su,Xudong Cai,Yeying Jin,Deying Li,Zhaoxin Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoDream是一个轻量级的视觉语言动作（VLA）框架，通过联合学习统一导航表示（UNR）和潜在全景预测任务（LPD），显著提升了单目视觉导航的性能，缩小了与全景RGB-D方法的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目视觉导航在现实部署中成本高或难以获取全景RGB-D信息的问题，同时提升单目方法的性能。

Method: 提出MonoDream框架，学习统一导航表示（UNR），并结合潜在全景预测任务（LPD）监督模型，仅基于单目输入预测全景RGB和深度特征。

Result: 在多个VLN基准测试中，MonoDream显著提升了单目导航性能，缩小了与全景方法的差距。

Conclusion: MonoDream通过联合学习视觉语义和语言动作意图，以及潜在全景预测任务，有效提升了单目视觉导航的可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

TL;DR: ReMoMask是一个统一的文本到运动生成框架，通过双向动量文本-运动模型、语义时空注意力机制和RAG-无分类器引导，显著提升了生成多样性和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到运动生成方法存在多样性不足、物理不合理等问题，ReMoMask旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 结合双向动量模型、语义时空注意力机制和RAG-无分类器引导，优化跨模态检索和运动生成。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML基准上，FID分数分别提升3.88%和10.97%。

Conclusion: ReMoMask在生成多样性和物理合理性方面表现优异，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However,
current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion
models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical
implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit
diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To
address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating
three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples
negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially
improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal
Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion
to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates
minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's
RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal
steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97%
improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to
the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M. Code:

TL;DR: 本文探讨了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉问答（VQA）评估中的性能方差问题，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在VQA评估中依赖点估计，忽略了性能方差的影响，可能导致评估不准确。

Method: 通过分析14个VQA基准测试，研究了训练种子、框架非确定性、模型规模和指令微调对性能方差的影响，并探索了Cloze-style评估策略。

Result: 研究发现当前评估方法存在局限性，性能方差显著影响结果可靠性。

Conclusion: 建议采用方差感知的评估方法，以提升MLLMs的稳健性和可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual
understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements,
the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,
overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as
stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter
configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing
variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as
visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We
systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,
model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.
Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment
strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving
reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of
current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to
foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

### [412] [PMGS: Reconstruction of Projectile Motion across Large Spatiotemporal Spans via 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02660)
*Yijun Xu,Jingrui Zhang,Yuhan Chen,Dingwen Wang,Lei Yu,Chu He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PMGS提出了一种基于3D高斯抛射的运动重建方法，通过两阶段流程和物理一致性约束，显著提升了高速非线性刚体运动的动态重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前动态重建方法局限于短时小尺度变形，且缺乏物理一致性考虑，PMGS旨在解决大时空跨度复杂刚体运动的建模问题。

Method: 1) 目标建模：通过动态场景分解和改进点密度控制实现对象集中重建；2) 运动恢复：通过逐帧SE(3)位姿学习恢复完整运动序列，引入加速度一致性约束和动态模拟退火策略。

Result: 实验表明PMGS在高速非线性刚体运动重建上优于主流动态方法。

Conclusion: PMGS通过物理约束和自适应策略，有效解决了复杂刚体运动的动态重建问题。

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an
unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly
confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration
for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing
Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:
1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic
scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:
restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce
an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose
estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively
schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman
fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to
mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in
reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVLThinker提出了一种开放且可复现的方法，用于构建基于推理的医学大模型，通过系统数据整理和两种训练范式（SFT和RLVR），发现RLVR表现更优，且仅使用文本数据训练效果优于多模态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学领域缺乏开放和可复现的推理模型构建方法的问题，推动社区研究和比较。

Method: 包括系统数据整理（文本和多模态数据）和两种训练范式：SFT和RLVR。

Result: RLVR显著优于SFT，且文本数据训练效果优于多模态数据；7B模型在公开VQA基准上达到新SOTA，32B模型性能接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: MedVLThinker为医学多模态推理研究提供了强大的开放基础，释放了数据、模型和代码。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by
enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building
reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and
comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet
strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data
curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to
varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.
Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six
medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly
outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,
counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning
data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal
image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on
text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA
benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,
scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary
GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community
with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AugPT是一种基于自增强的提示调优方法，通过内部数据增强和共识测试过滤噪声，无需外部知识即可提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示调优方法依赖外部知识，成本高且忽视图像模态特征，AugPT旨在通过内部数据增强解决这一问题。

Method: AugPT利用自监督增强训练集中的未标记图像，并通过共识测试的门控机制过滤噪声样本。

Result: 实验证明AugPT在不依赖外部知识的情况下提升了模型性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: AugPT为提示调优提供了一种高效且自包含的解决方案。

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge
for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach.
Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on
external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge
bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while
generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To
address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a
self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal
augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,
AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training
set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing
the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy
samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive
experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and
generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code
of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

*Wei Zhou,Peng Sun,Xuanhe Zhou,Qianglei Zang,Ji Xu,Tieying Zhang,Guoliang Li,Fan Wu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: DBAIOps是一个结合推理LLM和知识图谱的混合数据库运维系统，显著提升了诊断准确性和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动数据库运维方法无法有效利用专家经验，规则方法仅支持基础任务，LLM方法生成结果不准确或泛化。

Method: DBAIOps通过异构图模型表示诊断经验，半自动构建知识图谱，开发800+异常模型，并采用两阶段图演化机制和推理LLM进行诊断。

Result: 在四种主流数据库系统中，DBAIOps在根因和人工评估准确率上分别比基线高34.85%和47.22%。

Conclusion: DBAIOps有效结合专家经验和自动化技术，显著提升了数据库运维的诊断能力。

Abstract: The operation and maintenance (O&M) of database systems is critical to
ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert
experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective
diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&M methods,
including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On
the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g.,
metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and
cannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting
guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve
fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate
inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present
DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with
knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a
heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and
proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from
thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)
reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and
implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps
proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis
paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a
reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear
diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four
mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates
that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher
in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个系统性基准测试框架，评估了四种检索范式及其组合策略，揭示了混合搜索中的关键现象，并提出了高效替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代信息检索系统（如RAG）需要混合搜索，但其核心组件的权衡缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 通过11个真实数据集评估四种检索范式（FTS、SVS、DVS、TenS）及其组合与重排序策略。

Result: 发现三个关键现象：性能瓶颈效应、数据驱动的配置优化需求，以及TRF作为高效替代方案。

Conclusion: 为下一代混合搜索系统设计提供了具体指南，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Hybrid search, the integration of lexical and semantic retrieval, has become
a cornerstone of modern information retrieval systems, driven by demanding
applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The architectural
design space for these systems is vast and complex, yet a systematic, empirical
understanding of the trade-offs among their core components--retrieval
paradigms, combination schemes, and re-ranking methods--is critically lacking.
To address this, and informed by our experience building the Infinity
open-source database, we present the first systematic benchmark of advanced
hybrid search architectures. Our framework evaluates four retrieval
paradigms--Full-Text Search (FTS), Sparse Vector Search (SVS), Dense Vector
Search (DVS), and Tensor Search (TenS)--benchmarking their combinations and
re-ranking strategies across 11 real-world datasets. Our results reveal three
key findings for practitioners and researchers: (1) A "weakest link"
phenomenon, where a single underperforming retrieval path can
disproportionately degrade overall accuracy, highlighting the need for
path-wise quality assessment before fusion. (2) A data-driven map of the
performance trade-offs, demonstrating that optimal configurations depend
heavily on resource constraints and data characteristics, moving beyond a
one-size-fits-all approach. (3) The identification of Tensor-based Re-ranking
Fusion (TRF) as a high-efficacy alternative to mainstream fusion methods,
offering the semantic power of tensor search at a fraction of the computational
and memory cost. Our findings offer concrete guidelines for designing the next
generation of adaptive, scalable hybrid search systems while also identifying
key directions for future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出Marlin，一种云原生协调机制，通过将协调功能整合到现有云原生数据库中，解决了传统协调服务的可扩展性和成本效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代云数据库已转向存储解耦架构，但控制平面仍依赖外部协调服务（如ZooKeeper），导致可扩展性瓶颈和成本效率低下。

Method: Marlin通过存储解耦实现协调功能整合，支持跨节点修改协调状态，并引入MarlinCommit协议确保数据一致性。

Result: 评估显示，Marlin比传统协调方案成本效率提升4.4倍，重新配置时间减少4.9倍。

Conclusion: Marlin通过解耦协调功能，显著提升了云数据库的可扩展性和成本效率。

Abstract: Modern cloud databases are shifting from converged architectures to storage
disaggregation, enabling independent scaling and billing of compute and
storage. However, cloud databases still rely on external, converged
coordination services (e.g., ZooKeeper) for their control planes. These
services are effectively lightweight databases optimized for low-volume
metadata. As the control plane scales in the cloud, this approach faces similar
limitations as converged databases did before storage disaggregation:
scalability bottlenecks, low cost efficiency, and increased operational burden.
  We propose to disaggregate the cluster coordination to achieve the same
benefits that storage disaggregation brought to modern cloud DBMSs. We present
Marlin, a cloud-native coordination mechanism that fully embraces storage
disaggregation. Marlin eliminates the need for external coordination services
by consolidating coordination functionality into the existing cloud-native
database it manages. To achieve failover without an external coordination
service, Marlin allows cross-node modifications on coordination states. To
ensure data consistency, Marlin employs transactions to manage both
coordination and application states and introduces MarlinCommit, an optimized
commit protocol that ensures strong transactional guarantees even under
cross-node modifications. Our evaluations demonstrate that Marlin improves cost
efficiency by up to 4.4x and reduces reconfiguration duration by up to 4.9x
compared to converged coordination solutions.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: OnPair是一种字典压缩算法，适用于内存数据库系统，平衡了高压缩比和快速随机访问的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如BPE压缩比高但计算和内存成本高，而FSST速度快但压缩质量低。OnPair旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用缓存友好的字典构建技术，逐步合并频繁相邻子串，支持快速、内存高效的训练。OnPair16限制字典条目为16字节，优化最长前缀匹配。

Result: 实验显示OnPair和OnPair16压缩比接近BPE，同时显著提升压缩速度和内存效率。

Conclusion: OnPair在压缩比和性能之间取得了良好平衡，适用于需要高效随机访问的场景。

Abstract: We present OnPair, a dictionary-based compression algorithm designed to meet
the needs of in-memory database systems that require both high compression and
fast random access. Existing methods either achieve strong compression ratios
at significant computational and memory cost (e.g., BPE) or prioritize speed at
the expense of compression quality (e.g., FSST). OnPair bridges this gap by
employing a cache-friendly dictionary construction technique that incrementally
merges frequent adjacent substrings in a single sequential pass over a data
sample. This enables fast, memory-efficient training without tracking global
pair positions, as required by traditional BPE. We also introduce OnPair16, a
variant that limits dictionary entries to 16 bytes, enabling faster parsing via
optimized longest prefix matching. Both variants compress strings
independently, supporting fine-grained random access without block-level
overhead. Experiments on real-world datasets show that OnPair and OnPair16
achieve compression ratios comparable to BPE while significantly improving
compression speed and memory usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在情感理解和社交推理方面表现良好，但在需要推断隐含心理状态的复杂任务中表现不佳，缺乏理论对齐的监督和捕捉现实世界叙事中微妙心理过程的能力。

Method: 利用专家标注的心理丰富场景，提出轨迹感知强化学习框架，结合现实世界刺激和结构化推理指导，使模型内化社会认知原则。

Result: 实验表明，模型在多个基准测试中达到专家级解释能力，表现出强大的分布外泛化和持续学习能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了语言模型在心理任务中的表现，支持持续自我改进，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models show promise in emotion understanding, social
reasoning, and empathy, yet they struggle with psychologically grounded tasks
that require inferring implicit mental states in context-rich, ambiguous
settings. These limitations arise from the absence of theory-aligned
supervision and the difficulty of capturing nuanced mental processes in
real-world narratives. To address this gap, we leverage expert-labeled,
psychologically rich scenarios and propose a trajectory-aware reinforcement
learning framework that explicitly imitates expert psychological thought
patterns. By integrating real-world stimuli with structured reasoning guidance,
our approach enables compact models to internalize social-cognitive principles,
perform nuanced psychological inference, and support continual
self-improvement. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks further
demonstrate that our models achieve expert-level interpretive capabilities,
exhibiting strong out-of-distribution generalization and robust continual
learning across diverse, challenging, and psychologically grounded tasks.

TL;DR: M2是一种多模型分析系统，通过集成存储引擎和跨模型查询优化，显著提升了多模型数据分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据分析任务需要同时处理多种数据模型，而现有的多模型数据库系统或分散架构存在效率低下的问题。

Method: M2采用集成存储引擎，将多模型数据视为一等实体，并设计了多阶段哈希连接算法以高效组合不同模型的数据。

Result: 评估显示，M2在多模型分析任务中比现有方法快188倍。

Conclusion: M2通过创新设计和算法，有效解决了多模型数据分析的挑战。

Abstract: Modern data analytic workloads increasingly require handling multiple data
models simultaneously. Two primary approaches meet this need: polyglot
persistence and multi-model database systems. Polyglot persistence employs a
coordinator program to manage several independent database systems but suffers
from high communication costs due to its physically disaggregated architecture.
Meanwhile, existing multi-model database systems rely on a single storage
engine optimized for a specific data model, resulting in inefficient processing
across diverse data models. To address these limitations, we present M2, a
multi-model analytic system with integrated storage engines. M2 treats all data
models as first-class entities, composing query plans that incorporate
operations across models. To effectively combine data from different models,
the system introduces a specialized inter-model join algorithm called
multi-stage hash join. Our evaluation demonstrates that M2 outperforms existing
approaches by up to 188x speedup on multi-model analytics, confirming the
effectiveness of our proposed techniques.

Abstract: Load balancing is among the basic primitives in distributed computing. In
this paper, we consider this problem when executed locally on a network with
nodes prone to failures. We show that there exist lightweight network
topologies that are immune to message delivery failures incurred by (at most) a
constant fraction of all nodes. More precisely, we design a novel deterministic
fault-tolerant local load balancing (LLB) algorithm, which, similarly to their
classical counterparts working in fault-free networks, has a relatively simple
structure and guarantees exponentially fast convergence to the average value
despite crash and omission failures.
  As the second part of our contribution, we show three applications of the
newly developed fault-tolerant local load balancing protocol. We give a
randomized consensus algorithm, working against $t < n / 3$ crash failures,
that improves over the best-known consensus solution by Hajiaghayi et al. with
respect to communication complexity, yet with an arguable simpler technique of
combining a randomly and locally selected virtual communication graph with a
deterministic fault-tolerant local load balancing on this graph.
  We also give a new solution for consensus for networks with omission
failures. Our solution works against $t < \frac{n}{C\log{n} (\log\log n)^2}$
omissions, for some constant $C$, is nearly optimal in terms of time
complexity, but most notably -- it has communication complexity $O((t^2 +
n)\text{ polylog } {n})$, matching, within a polylogarithmic factor, the lower
bound by Abraham et. al. with respect to both terms depending on $t$ and $n$.
Ours is the first algorithm in the literature that is simultaneously nearly
optimal, in terms of $n,t$, with respect to both complexity measures, against
the adaptive omission-causing adversary.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文展示了确定性LOCAL模型中Δ-着色问题的新上界，与MIS问题复杂度匹配，并提出了从Δ-着色到MIS的归约方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进确定性LOCAL模型中图问题的复杂度，特别是Δ-着色问题，以匹配MIS问题的最新上界。

Method: 开发了一种从Δ-着色到MIS的归约方法，确保Δ-着色的复杂度不超过MIS的复杂度。

Conclusion: 任何对MIS问题复杂度的改进都将直接提升Δ-着色问题的复杂度，表明两者之间的紧密联系。

Abstract: Recent improvements on the deterministic complexities of fundamental graph
problems in the LOCAL model of distributed computing have yielded
state-of-the-art upper bounds of $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} n)$ rounds for maximal
independent set (MIS) and $(\Delta + 1)$-coloring [Ghaffari, Grunau, FOCS'24]
and $\tilde{O}(\log^{19/9} n)$ rounds for the more restrictive
$\Delta$-coloring problem [Ghaffari, Kuhn, FOCS'21; Ghaffari, Grunau, FOCS'24;
Bourreau, Brandt, Nolin, STOC'25]. In our work, we show that $\Delta$-coloring
can be solved deterministically in $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} n)$ rounds as well,
matching the currently best bound for $(\Delta + 1)$-coloring.
  We achieve our result by developing a reduction from $\Delta$-coloring to MIS
that guarantees that the (asymptotic) complexity of $\Delta$-coloring is at
most the complexity of MIS, unless MIS can be solved in sublogarithmic time, in
which case, due to the $\Omega(\log n)$-round $\Delta$-coloring lower bound
from [BFHKLRSU, STOC'16], our reduction implies a tight complexity of
$\Theta(\log n)$ for $\Delta$-coloring. In particular, any improvement on the
complexity of the MIS problem will yield the same improvement for the
complexity of $\Delta$-coloring (up to the true complexity of
$\Delta$-coloring).
  Our reduction yields improvements for $\Delta$-coloring in the randomized
LOCAL model and when complexities are parameterized by both $n$ and $\Delta$.
We obtain a randomized complexity bound of $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} \log n)$
rounds (improving over the state of the art of $\tilde{O}(\log^{8/3} \log n)$
rounds) on general graphs and tight complexities of $\Theta(\log n)$ and
$\Theta(\log \log n)$ for the deterministic, resp.\ randomized, complexity on
bounded-degree graphs. In the special case of graphs of constant clique number
(which for instance include bipartite graphs), we also give a reduction to the
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring problem.

### [425] [Efficient Byzantine Consensus MechanismBased on Reputation in IoT Blockchain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01856)

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的拜占庭声誉共识机制（EBRC），以解决区块链在物联网应用中因共识算法导致的存储、计算和扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链在物联网（IoT）中的应用面临存储、计算和扩展性挑战，现有共识算法存在节点可靠性低、交易处理速度慢等问题。

Method: 作者重新设计了节点可靠性和鲁棒性评估方法，并优化了活跃节点管理，提出了EBRC机制。

Abstract: Blockchain technology has advanced rapidly in recent years and is now widely
used in a variety of fields. Blockchain appears to be one of the best solutions
for managing massive heterogeneous devices while achieving advanced data
security and data reputation, particularly in the field of large-scale IoT
(Internet of Things) networks. Despite the numerous advantages, there are still
challenges while deploying IoT applications on blockchain systems due to the
limited storage, power, and computing capability of IoT devices, and some of
these problems are caused by the consensus algorithm, which plays a significant
role in blockchain systems by ensuring overall system reliability and
robustness. Nonetheless, most existing consensus algorithms are prone to poor
node reliability, low transaction per second (TPS) rates, and scalability
issues. Aiming at some critical problems in the existing consensus algorithms,
this paper proposes the Efficient Byzantine Reputation-based Consensus (EBRC)
mechanism to resolve the issues raised above. In comparison to traditional
algorithms, we reinvented ways to evaluate node reliability and robustness and
manage active nodes. Our experiments show that the EBRC algorithm has lower
consensus delay, higher throughput, improved security, and lower verification
costs. It offers new reference ideas for solving the Internet of
Things+blockchain+Internet court construction problem.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合无人机辅助可重构智能表面（RIS）、非正交多址接入（NOMA）和协作多点传输（CoMP）的系统模型，以提高6G网络中的数据速率和频谱效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的架构在提升网络性能方面具有潜力。

Abstract: In the future 6G and wireless networks, particularly in dense urban
environments, bandwidth exhaustion and limited capacity pose significant
challenges to enhancing data rates. We introduce a novel system model designed
to improve the data rate of users in next-generation multi-cell networks by
integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-Assisted Reconfigurable Intelligent
Surfaces (RIS), Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), and Coordinated
Multipoint Transmission (CoMP). Optimally deploying Aerial RIS for higher data
rates, employing NOMA to improve spectral efficiency, and utilizing CoMP to
mitigate inter-cell interference (ICI), we significantly enhance the overall
system capacity and sum rate. Furthermore, we address the challenge of feedback
overhead associated with Quantized Phase Shifts (QPS) from the receiver to RIS.
The feedback channel is band-limited and cannot support a large overhead of QPS
for uplink communication. To ensure seamless transmission, we propose a Machine
Learning Autoencoder technique for a compressed communication of QPS from the
receiver to RIS, while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, we investigate
the impact of the number of Aerial RIS elements and power allocation ratio for
NOMA on the individual data rate of users. Our simulation results demonstrate
substantial improvements in spectral efficiency, outage probability, and
bandwidth utilization, highlighting the potential of the proposed architecture
to enhance network performance.

### [427] [Prefill-Decode Aggregation or Disaggregation? Unifying Both for Goodput-Optimized LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01989)
*Chao Wang,Pengfei Zuo,Zhangyu Chen,Yunkai Liang,Zhou Yu,Ming-Chang Yang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TaiChi是一个统一预填充-解码（PD）聚合与解聚的LLM服务系统，通过动态调整资源分配和调度机制，在不同SLO（TTFT和TPOT）下实现最优吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预填充-解码聚合与解聚在不同服务目标（SLOs）下无法同时优化的问题，提出一种统一架构以适应各种需求。

Method: 采用统一架构结合两种GPU实例（预填充密集型和解码密集型），通过三个可调滑块动态调整资源分配，并利用延迟转移和调度机制优化请求分配。

Result: 在平衡的TTFT和TPOT SLOs下，TaiChi比现有系统提升吞吐量高达77%。

Conclusion: TaiChi通过灵活的架构和调度机制，在不同SLOs下均能实现最优性能，为LLM服务系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: An ongoing debate considers whether prefill-decode (PD) aggregation or
disaggregation is superior for serving large language models (LLMs). This has
driven optimizations for both approaches, each showing distinct advantages.
This paper compares PD aggregation and disaggregation, showing that each excels
under different service-level objectives (SLOs): aggregation is optimal for
tight time-to-first-token (TTFT) and relaxed time-per-output-token (TPOT),
while disaggregation excels for strict TPOT and relaxed TTFT. However, under
balanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs, neither approach delivers optimal goodput.
  This paper proposes TaiChi, an LLM serving system that unifies PD
disaggregation and aggregation for optimal goodput under any combination of
TTFT and TPOT SLOs. TaiChi uses a unified disaggregation-aggregation
architecture with differentiated-capability GPU instances: prefill-heavy (fast
prefill, high-interference decode) and decode-heavy (low-interference decode,
slow prefill). Three configurable sliders control the ratio between these
instances and their chunk sizes. TaiChi adapts to various SLO regimes by
adjusting sliders. When TTFT constraints are tight, TaiChi resembles a PD
aggregation configuration; when TPOT dominates, it adapts toward PD
disaggregation. Crucially, under balanced SLOs, TaiChi enables a hybrid mode
for superior goodput. The key innovation behind this hybrid mode is latency
shifting: selectively reallocating GPU resources from requests that meet SLOs
to those at risk of violation, maximizing the number of SLO-satisfied requests.
This fine-grained latency shifting is orchestrated by two scheduling
mechanisms: flowing decode scheduling to control TPOTs and length-aware prefill
scheduling to manage TTFTs, which jointly optimize request assignment. Our
experiments show TaiChi improves goodput by up to 77% over state-of-the-art
systems under balanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs.

*Yizhou Shi,Qianpiao Ma,Yan Xu,Junlong Zhou,Ming Hu,Yunming Liao,Hongli Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: DySTop是一种创新的异步去中心化联邦学习机制，通过动态控制陈旧性和优化拓扑结构，显著提升了训练效率和通信资源利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有异步去中心化联邦学习（ADFL）中模型陈旧性和高通信开销的问题，以提升在非独立同分布（non-IID）数据下的训练性能。

Method: 提出DySTop机制，结合动态陈旧性控制和拓扑结构优化，包括工人激活算法（WAA）和阶段感知拓扑构建算法（PTCA）。

Result: DySTop将完成时间减少51.8%，通信资源消耗降低57.1%，同时保持模型准确性。

Conclusion: DySTop在异步去中心化联邦学习中表现出色，为动态边缘环境提供了高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a potential distributed learning
paradigm that enables model training on edge devices (i.e., workers) while
preserving data privacy. However, its reliance on a centralized server leads to
limited scalability. Decentralized federated learning (DFL) eliminates the
dependency on a centralized server by enabling peer-to-peer model exchange.
Existing DFL mechanisms mainly employ synchronous communication, which may
result in training inefficiencies under heterogeneous and dynamic edge
environments. Although a few recent asynchronous DFL (ADFL) mechanisms have
been proposed to address these issues, they typically yield stale model
aggregation and frequent model transmission, leading to degraded training
performance on non-IID data and high communication overhead. To overcome these
issues, we present DySTop, an innovative mechanism that jointly optimizes
dynamic staleness control and topology construction in ADFL. In each round,
multiple workers are activated, and a subset of their neighbors is selected to
transmit models for aggregation, followed by local training. We provide a
rigorous convergence analysis for DySTop, theoretically revealing the
quantitative relationships between the convergence bound and key factors such
as maximum staleness, activating frequency, and data distribution among
workers. From the insights of the analysis, we propose a worker activation
algorithm (WAA) for staleness control and a phase-aware topology construction
algorithm (PTCA) to reduce communication overhead and handle data non-IID.
Extensive evaluations through both large-scale simulations and real-world
testbed experiments demonstrate that our DySTop reduces completion time by
51.8% and the communication resource consumption by 57.1% compared to
state-of-the-art solutions, while maintaining the same model accuracy.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种完全去中心化的共识协议BECP，适用于超大规模区块链系统，通过流行病协议的优势，在吞吐量、可扩展性和共识延迟方面优于传统协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链的去中心化和不可变性使其广泛应用于多个领域，但现有共识算法存在节点故障、资源消耗高、合谋等问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出BECP协议，利用流行病协议的特点（如不依赖固定验证者、概率收敛保证、高效网络资源利用、容忍节点和网络故障），并与传统协议（PAXOS、RAFT、PBFT）及Avalanche进行对比实验。

Result: BECP在吞吐量、可扩展性和共识延迟方面表现优异，吞吐量平均提高1.196倍，共识延迟降低4.775倍，且消息数量显著减少。

Conclusion: BECP展示了基于流行病协议的完全去中心化共识在区块链技术中的高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Blockchain is a decentralised, immutable ledger technology that has been
widely adopted in many sectors for various applications such as
cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and supply chain management. Distributed
consensus is a fundamental component of blockchain, which is required to ensure
trust, security, and integrity of the data stored and the transactions
processed in the blockchain. Various consensus algorithms have been developed,
each affected from certain issues such as node failures, high resource
consumption, collusion, etc. This work introduces a fully decentralised
consensus protocol, Blockchain Epidemic Consensus Protocol (BECP), suitable for
very large and extreme-scale blockchain systems. The proposed approach
leverages the benefits of epidemic protocols, such as no reliance on a fixed
set of validators or leaders, probabilistic guarantees of convergence,
efficient use of network resources, and tolerance to node and network failures.
A comparative experimental analysis has been carried out with traditional
protocols including PAXOS, RAFT, and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
(PBFT), as well as a relatively more recent protocol such as Avalanche, which
is specifically designed for very large-scale systems. The results illustrate
how BECP outperforms them in terms of throughput, scalability and consensus
latency. BECP achieves an average of 1.196 times higher throughput in terms of
consensus on items and 4.775 times better average consensus latency.
Furthermore, BECP significantly reduces the number of messages compared to
Avalanche. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of fully
decentralised consensus for blockchain technology based on epidemic protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着异构应用服务和计算系统的增多，资源管理问题日益重要，现有解决方案缺乏扩展性和动态适应性。

Result: 验证表明，该方案在资源评估中表现直接，同时具备可扩展性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 该算法为资源分配提供了高效、灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: With an ever growing number of heterogeneous applicational services running
on equally heterogeneous computational systems, the problem of resource
management becomes more essential. Although current solutions consider some
network and time requirements, they mostly handle a pre-defined list of
resource types by design and, consequently, fail to provide an extensible
solution to assess any other set of requirements or to switch strategies on its
resource estimation. This work proposes an heuristics-based estimation solution
to support any computational system as a self-assessment, including
considerations on dynamically weighting the requirements, how to compute each
node's capacity towards an admission request, and also offers the possibility
to extend the list of resource types considered for assessment, which is an
uncommon view in related works. This algorithm can be used by distributed and
centralized resource allocation protocols to decide the best node(s) for a
service intended for deployment. This approach was validated across its
components and the results show that its performance is straightforward in
resource estimation while allowing scalability and extensibility.

Result: 实验表明FedAPTA比现有FL方法性能提升高达4.23%。

Conclusion: FedAPTA有效解决了FL在CPNs中的多任务资源浪费问题，并显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has shown considerable promise in Computing Power
Networks (CPNs) for privacy protection, efficient data utilization, and dynamic
collaboration. Although it offers practical benefits, applying FL in CPNs
continues to encounter a major obstacle, i.e., multi-task deployment. However,
existing work mainly focuses on mitigating FL's computation and communication
overhead of a single task while overlooking the computing resource wastage
issue of heterogeneous devices across multiple tasks in FL under CPNs. To
tackle this, we design FedAPTA, a federated multi-task learning framework in
CPNs. FedAPTA alleviates computing resource wastage through the developed
layer-wise model pruning technique, which reduces local model size while
considering both data and device heterogeneity. To aggregate structurally
heterogeneous local models of different tasks, we introduce a heterogeneous
model recovery strategy and a task-aware model aggregation method that enables
the aggregation through infilling local model architecture with the shared
global model and clustering local models according to their specific tasks. We
deploy FedAPTA on a realistic FL platform and benchmark it against nine SOTA FL
methods. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed FedAPTA
considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art FL methods by up to 4.23%. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Zhenzovo/FedCPN.

TL;DR: PUSHtap结合CPU和PIM单元的双维访问，解决HTAP系统中的数据格式矛盾，提升OLAP/OLTP性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTAP系统面临数据格式矛盾（行存与列存），难以同时实现性能隔离、数据新鲜度和负载优化。PIM技术为OLAP提供加速，但需与CPU协同。

Method: 提出统一数据存储格式，优化CPU与PIM带宽；实现MVCC；扩展PIM架构支持OLAP和并发访问。

Result: 实验显示，PUSHtap在OLAP/OLTP吞吐量上比多实例PIM设计提升3.4倍/4.4倍。

Conclusion: PUSHtap通过结合CPU与PIM，有效解决HTAP数据格式问题，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) is an emerging database
paradigm that supports both online transaction processing (OLTP) and online
analytical processing (OLAP) workloads. Computing-intensive OLTP operations,
involving row-wise data manipulation, are suitable for row-store format. In
contrast, memory-intensive OLAP operations, which are column-centric, benefit
from column-store format. This \emph{data-format dilemma} prevents HTAP systems
from concurrently achieving three design goals: performance isolation, data
freshness, and workload-specific optimization. Another background technology is
Processing-in-Memory (PIM), which integrates computing units (PIM units) inside
DRAM memory devices to accelerate memory-intensive workloads, including OLAP.
  Our key insight is to combine the interleaved CPU access and localized PIM
unit access to provide two-dimensional access to address the data format
contradictions inherent in HTAP. First, we propose a unified data storage
format with novel data alignment and placement techniques to optimize the
effective bandwidth of CPUs and PIM units and exploit the PIM's parallelism.
Second, we implement the multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) essential for
single-instance HTAP. Third, we extend the commercial PIM architecture to
support the OLAP operations and concurrent access from PIM and CPU. Experiments
show that PUSHtap can achieve 3.4\texttimes{}/4.4\texttimes{} OLAP/OLTP
throughput improvement compared to multi-instance PIM-based design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决片上互连设计中带宽扩展与低延迟、高面积效率之间的矛盾，避免因传统2D网状或交叉开关的局限性而导致的硬件和软件开销。

Method: 采用32位字宽多通道2D网状和交叉开关的混合拓扑结构，设计路由器重映射器以平衡流量负载。

Result: 在12nm技术下实现了1024核共享4096个L1存储器的集群，计算利用率高达0.85 IPC，功耗和面积效率显著优于纯交叉开关设计。

Conclusion: TeraNoC是一种高效、可扩展的片上互连解决方案，适用于多核低延迟共享内存集群。

Abstract: A key challenge in on-chip interconnect design is to scale up bandwidth while
maintaining low latency and high area efficiency. 2D-meshes scale with low
wiring area and congestion overhead; however, their end-to-end latency
increases with the number of hops, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive
core-to-L1-memory access. On the other hand, crossbars offer low latency, but
their routing complexity grows quadratically with the number of I/Os, requiring
large physical routing resources and limiting area-efficient scalability. This
two-sided interconnect bottleneck hinders the scale-up of many-core,
low-latency, tightly coupled shared-memory clusters, pushing designers toward
instantiating many smaller and loosely coupled clusters, at the cost of
hardware and software overheads. We present TeraNoC, an open-source, hybrid
mesh-crossbar on-chip interconnect that offers both scalability and low
latency, while maintaining very low routing overhead. The topology, built on
32bit word-width multi-channel 2D-meshes and crossbars, enables the
area-efficient scale-up of shared-memory clusters. A router remapper is
designed to balance traffic load across interconnect channels. Using TeraNoC,
we build a cluster with 1024 single-stage, single-issue cores that share a
4096-banked L1 memory, implemented in 12nm technology. The low interconnect
stalls enable high compute utilization of up to 0.85 IPC in compute-intensive,
data-parallel key GenAI kernels. TeraNoC only consumes 7.6\% of the total
cluster power in kernels dominated by crossbar accesses, and 22.7\% in kernels
with high 2D-mesh traffic. Compared to a hierarchical crossbar-only cluster,
TeraNoC reduces die area by 37.8\% and improves area efficiency (GFLOP/s/mm2)
by up to 98.7\%, while occupying only 10.9\% of the logic area.

Motivation: 随着LLM通过MoE扩展和AI硬件（如SuperPod）的升级，运行大规模MoE模型带来新挑战，需要新的执行模型和调度策略。

Method: 提出Transformerless解耦架构，将Transformer模型分解为模块化单元（注意力、前馈、MoE），独立执行于NPU上；设计XCCL通信库和扩展FlowServe引擎。

Result: 实现了解耦的预填充-解码和MoE-注意力形式，支持计算与内存独立扩展而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: xDeepServe为SuperPod规模基础设施提供了高效、可扩展的LLM服务解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of scaled-out LLMs and scaled-up SuperPods signals a new era in
large-scale AI infrastructure. LLMs continue to scale out via MoE, as seen in
recent models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen. In parallel, AI hardware is
scaling up, with Huawei's CloudMatrix384 SuperPod offering hundreds of GB/s
high-speed interconnects. Running large MoE models on SuperPod-scale hardware
brings new challenges. It requires new execution models, scalable scheduling,
efficient expert load balancing, and elimination of single points of failure.
This paper presents xDeepServe, Huawei Cloud's LLM serving system designed for
SuperPod-scale infrastructure. At its core is Transformerless, a disaggregated
architecture that decomposes transformer models into modular units--attention,
feedforward, and MoE--executed independently on NPUs connected via high-speed
fabric. We implement this design in two forms: disaggregated prefill-decode and
disaggregated MoE-attention. This fully disaggregated setup enables independent
scaling of compute and memory without sacrificing performance. To support this
architecture, we propose XCCL, a communication library that leverages
CloudMatrix384's global shared memory to implement efficient point-to-point and
all-to-all primitives. We also extend our serving engine FlowServe with
system-level techniques, enabling scalable inference across hundreds of NPUs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共识协议在可扩展性、资源消耗和容错性方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: BECP采用流行病传播原则，无固定角色，实现概率收敛和高效消息传播。

Result: BECP在吞吐量、共识延迟和消息传递效率上优于现有协议。

Conclusion: BECP是一种适用于下一代区块链系统的有效且可扩展的共识协议。

Abstract: Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that has applications in many
domains such as cryptocurrency, smart contracts, supply chain management, and
many others. Distributed consensus is a fundamental component of blockchain
systems that enables secure, precise, and tamper-proof verification of data
without relying on central authorities. Existing consensus protocols,
nevertheless, suffer from drawbacks, some of which are related to scalability,
resource consumption, and fault tolerance. We introduce Blockchain Epidemic
Consensus Protocol (BECP), a novel fully decentralised consensus protocol for
blockchain networks at a large scale. BECP follows epidemic communication
principles, without fixed roles like validators or leaders, and achieves
probabilistic convergence, efficient message dissemination, and tolerance to
message delays. We provide an extensive experimental comparison of BECP against
classic protocols like PAXOS, RAFT, and PBFT, and newer epidemic-based
protocols like Avalanche and Snowman. The findings indicate that BECP provides
desirable gains in throughput, consensus latency, and substantial
message-passing efficiency compared to existing epidemic-based approaches,
validating its usability as an effective and scalable approach for
next-generation blockchain systems.

Conclusion: MAAC-SAM为6G网络中的动态连接管理提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Managing connectivity in integrated satellite-terrestrial vehicular networks
is critical for 6G, yet is challenged by dynamic conditions and partial
observability. This letter introduces the Multi-Agent Actor-Critic with
Satellite-Aided Multi-head self-attention (MAAC-SAM), a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework that enables vehicles to autonomously manage
connectivity across Vehicle-to-Satellite (V2S), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure
(V2I), and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) links. Our key innovation is the
integration of a multi-head attention mechanism, which allows for robust state
estimation even with fluctuating and limited information sharing among
vehicles. The framework further leverages self-imitation learning (SIL) and
fingerprinting to improve learning efficiency and real-time decisions.
Simulation results, based on realistic SUMO traffic models and 3GPP-compliant
configurations, demonstrate that MAAC-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art
terrestrial and satellite-assisted baselines by up to 14% in transmission
utility and maintains high estimation accuracy across varying vehicle densities

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于内容中心网络（CCN）的改进架构，通过集成分散式编码缓存（DCC）技术，优化内容存储和传输策略，显著提升网络性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IP网络的局限性促使了内容中心网络（CCN）的发展，但CCN仍有优化空间。通过引入DCC技术，可以进一步利用分布式缓存资源，提升网络效率。

Method: 在CCN架构中集成DCC技术，采用差异化编码策略，并根据用户访问权限优化内容预置。同时支持在内容传输路径上对未编码数据进行重新编码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了网络吞吐量、缓存命中率，并降低了内容交付延迟。

Conclusion: 通过结合DCC技术，CCN架构的性能得到了显著提升，为未来网络优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Content-Centric Networking (CCN) offers a novel architectural paradigm that
seeks to address the inherent limitations of the prevailing Internet Protocol
(IP)-based networking model. In contrast to the host-centric communication
approach of IP networks, CCN prioritizes content by enabling direct addressing
and routing based on content identifiers. The potential performance
improvements of CCN can be further amplified through optimized management of
coded data storage and transmission strategies. Decentralized Coded Caching
(DCC) emerges as a promising technique that harnesses the collective caching
power of distributed network elements. By strategically pre-positioning
frequently accessed content closer to potential consumers during periods of low
network utilization, DCC has the potential to mitigate content transfer rates
during peak traffic periods. This paper proposes a series of fundamental
modifications to the CCN architecture by integrating DCC. The proposed
framework incorporates differentiated coding strategies tailored to user access
privileges, thereby eliminating the overhead associated with queue-based
searching. Additionally, the framework facilitates recoding of uncoded data
encountered along the content delivery path. These combined methodologies
demonstrably enhance network throughput, elevate cache hit ratios, and
consequently, reduce content delivery latency compared to conventional CCN
implementations.

TL;DR: M3LLM提出了一种分布式多模态大语言模型架构，通过Model Context Protocol（MCP）协调边缘视觉专家，优化任务性能和通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM依赖集中式架构，视觉编码模块与任务对齐差，限制了动态视觉任务的性能。

Method: M3LLM通过MCP协议结构化任务上下文，结合双流SAC算法和ASEM模块优化视觉专家路由。

Result: 实验表明M3LLM提升了任务准确性，降低了通信成本，增强了动态网络条件下的路由适应性。

Conclusion: M3LLM为分布式MLLM提供了一种高效、动态的解决方案。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on centralized
architectures and often suffer from poor alignment between the input task and
their fixed visual encoding modules, which limits performance on diverse and
dynamic visual tasks. With the increasing deployment of resource-efficient
models on edge devices in wireless networks, a new opportunity emerges to
dynamically use distributed vision experts for improved MLLM inference quality.
To enable this, we propose M3LLM, where the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
coordinates a mixture of vision experts to achieve distributed MLLMs.
Specifically, MCP is an open protocol that structures the input task context
into interpretable representations, enabling wireless network-aware
coordination between the central model backbone and edge-hosted vision experts.
Based on the MCP representation, M3LLM formulates vision expert routing as a
joint optimization problem that balances task-expert semantic compatibility and
channel performance. To solve the resulting gradient conflicts, we develop a
dual-stream Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm with decoupled reward signals and
introduce an Adaptive Stability Enhancement Module (ASEM) based on hierarchical
Bayesian modeling to ensure effective routing. Experiments show that M3LLM
improves task accuracy, reduces communication cost, and enhances expert routing
adaptability under dynamic wireless network conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种隐私保护的两阶段视频缓存优化方法，结合联邦学习和多阶段背包问题，显著提升系统收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频缓存能提升无线视频流传输效率，但缓存容量有限且用户需求动态变化，需优化策略以最大化系统收益。

Method: 1. 使用隐私保护的联邦学习训练Transformer预测多时段需求；2. 结合全局内容流行度和预测结果估计需求分布；3. 将缓存优化问题转化为整数线性规划求解。

Result: 联邦学习方案性能接近理想集中式方案，优于现有缓存方法；收益优化方法比传统缓存命中率方法提供更深入的系统性能洞察。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段隐私保护方法有效优化了视频缓存系统的长期收益，兼具高性能和隐私保护。

Abstract: Video caching can significantly improve delivery efficiency and enhance
quality of video streaming, which constitutes the majority of wireless
communication traffic. Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be
designed to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system
revenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested
videos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache
replacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the
replacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache
placement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning.
Motivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution
for revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a
Transformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict
multi-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely
accurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content
popularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand
distribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results
to find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This
latter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we
then transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results
demonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to
that of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching
methods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper
system performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based
optimization approaches.

TL;DR: NetConv是一种新型卷积预训练模型，用于加密流量分类，解决了Transformer模型的效率低和扩展性差的问题，性能提升6.88%，吞吐量提高7.41倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的预训练模型在加密流量分类中存在效率低和扩展性差的问题，卷积模型虽效率高但性能较低，需平衡这一权衡。

Method: 提出NetConv，采用堆叠的流量卷积层，通过窗口级字节评分和序列级字节门控捕获局部字节模式，设计了连续字节掩码预训练任务。

Result: 在四个任务上的实验显示，NetConv平均分类性能提升6.88%，模型吞吐量提高7.41倍。

Conclusion: NetConv在加密流量分类中优于现有预训练模型，兼具高效性和扩展性。

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification is vital for modern network management and
security. To reduce reliance on handcrafted features and labeled data, recent
methods focus on learning generic representations through pre-training on
large-scale unlabeled data. However, current pre-trained models face two
limitations originating from the adopted Transformer architecture: (1) Limited
model efficiency due to the self-attention mechanism with quadratic complexity;
(2) Unstable traffic scalability to longer byte sequences, as the explicit
positional encodings fail to generalize to input lengths not seen during
pre-training. In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear
complexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers
in encrypted traffic classification with pre-training. We first conduct a
systematic comparison, and observe that convolutions achieve higher efficiency
and scalability, with lower classification performance. To address this
trade-off, we propose NetConv, a novel pre-trained convolution model for
encrypted traffic classification. NetConv employs stacked traffic convolution
layers, which enhance the ability to capture localized byte-sequence patterns
through window-wise byte scoring and sequence-wise byte gating. We design a
continuous byte masking pre-training task to help NetConv learn
protocol-specific patterns. Experimental results on four tasks demonstrate that
NetConv improves average classification performance by 6.88% and model
throughput by 7.41X over existing pre-trained models.

TL;DR: 论文提出PRIME框架，通过动态调整模型参数规模解决加密流量分类中增量学习导致的模型可塑性下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络流量加密普及，增量学习在加密流量分类中面临模型可塑性下降的挑战。

Method: PRIME框架通过监测模型参数的有效秩和不活跃神经元比例，动态调整参数规模。

Result: 实验表明，PRIME在多个加密流量数据集和增量场景中表现优于其他增量学习算法。

Conclusion: PRIME框架能有效提升增量学习模型的可塑性和分类性能。

Abstract: With the continuous development of network environments and technologies,
ensuring cyber security and governance is increasingly challenging. Network
traffic classification(ETC) can analyzes attributes such as application
categories and malicious intent, supporting network management services like
QoS optimization, intrusion detection, and targeted billing. As the prevalence
of traffic encryption increases, deep learning models are relied upon for
content-agnostic analysis of packet sequences. However, the emergence of new
services and attack variants often leads to incremental tasks for ETC models.
To ensure model effectiveness, incremental learning techniques are essential;
however, recent studies indicate that neural networks experience declining
plasticity as tasks increase. We identified plasticity issues in existing
incremental learning methods across diverse traffic samples and proposed the
PRIME framework. By observing the effective rank of model parameters and the
proportion of inactive neurons, the PRIME architecture can appropriately
increase the parameter scale when the model's plasticity deteriorates.
Experiments show that in multiple encrypted traffic datasets and different
category increment scenarios, the PRIME architecture performs significantly
better than other incremental learning algorithms with minimal increase in
parameter scale.

Motivation: 当前加密流量分类系统存在计算延迟高和依赖标签数据的限制，无法适应新型流量类型的出现。

Result: NetClus在保持分类性能下降低于1%的同时，实现了6.2倍的加速。

Conclusion: NetClus有效解决了现有预训练模型的计算和适应性瓶颈，为加密流量分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic classification plays a significant role in network service
management. The advancement of deep learning has established pretrained models
as a robust approach for this task. However, contemporary encrypted traffic
classification systems face dual limitations. Firstly, pretrained models
typically exhibit large-scale architectures, where their extensive
parameterization results in slow inference speeds and high computational
latency. Secondly, reliance on labeled data for fine-tuning restricts these
models to predefined supervised classes, creating a bottleneck when novel
traffic types emerge in the evolving Internet landscape. To address these
challenges, we propose NetClus, a novel framework integrating pretrained models
with distillation-enhanced clustering acceleration. During fine-tuning, NetClus
first introduces a cluster-friendly loss to jointly reshape the latent space
for both classification and clustering. With the fine-tuned model, it distills
the model into a lightweight Feed-Forward Neural Network model to retain
semantics. During inference, NetClus performs heuristic merge with near-linear
runtime, and valid the cluster purity with newly proposed metrics ASI to
identify emergent traffic types while expediting classification. Benchmarked
against existing pretrained methods, NetClus achieves up to 6.2x acceleration
while maintaining classification degradation below 1%.

Method: 采用多层知识图谱架构和图神经网络（GNN），评估四种GNN架构在数字孪生中的有效性，使用RIPE Atlas公开数据训练。

Result: GraphTransformer表现最佳，其他架构在训练时间短且结果可接受的场景中更适用。

Conclusion: AI-NDT为下一代网络提供了一种可扩展且准确的主动管理解决方案。

Abstract: Future networks, such as 6G, will need to support a vast and diverse range of
interconnected devices and applications, each with its own set of requirements.
While traditional network management approaches will suffice, an automated
solutions are becoming a must. However, network automation frameworks are prone
to errors, and often they employ ML-based techniques that require training to
learn how the network can be optimized. In this sense, network digital twins
are a useful tool that allows for the simulation, testing, and training of AI
models without affecting the real-world networks and users. This paper presents
an AI-based Network Digital Twin (AI-NDT) that leverages a multi-layered
knowledge graph architecture and graph neural networks to predict network
metrics that directly affect the quality of experience of users. An evaluation
of the four most prominent Graph Neural Networks (GNN) architectures was
conducted to assess their effectiveness in developing network digital twins. We
trained the digital twin on publicly available measurement data from RIPE
Atlas, therefore obtaining results close to what is expected in real-world
applications. The results show that among the four architectures evaluated,
GraphTransformer presents the best performance. However, other architectures
might fit better in scenarios where shorter training time is important, while
also delivering acceptable results. The results of this work are indicative of
what might become common practice for proactive network management, offering a
scalable and accurate solution aligned with the requirements of the
next-generation networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖WHOIS或PeeringDB，无法捕捉跨区域别名或父子所有权等复杂关系，导致组织信息分散。

Method: ASINT融合批量注册数据和非结构化网络来源，采用RAG引导大型语言模型（LLM）推理，通过多阶段程序合并ASN为“组织家族”。

Result: ASINT映射了111,470个ASN到81,233个组织家族，识别出更多跨区域分组，并在安全和测量任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: ASINT通过结合更广泛的网络证据，提供了更准确且可更新的互联网组织结构视图。

Abstract: Accurately mapping Autonomous Systems (ASNs) to their owning or operating
organizations underpins Internet measurement research and security
applications. Yet existing approaches commonly rely solely on WHOIS or
PeeringDB, missing important relationships (e.g., cross-regional aliases,
parent-child ownership) and failing to unify organizations scattered across
different RIR identifiers. We introduce ASINT, an end-to-end pipeline that
fuses bulk registry data with unstructured Web sources, then employs
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to guide large language model (LLM)
inference. Through a multi-stage procedure, ASINT merges ASNs into
"organization families," capturing nuanced ties beyond the scope of simpler
heuristics.
  ASINT maps 111,470 ASNs to 81,233 organization families; compared to both
AS2ORG+ and AS-Sibling, ASINT identifies more cross-regional groupings (e.g.,
operator aliases, rebrands) that other datasets overlook. Moreover, our refined
mappings enhance multiple security and measurement tasks: ASINT exposes 27.5%
more intra-organizational RPKI misconfigurations, cuts false-positive hijack
alarms by 9.4%, and lowers erroneous IP leasing inferences by 5.9%.
  Finally, ASINT supports periodic updates and cost-sensitive LLM selection,
demonstrating that broader Web evidence can provide a more accurate, evolving
view of the Internet's organizational structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步程序在安全关键嵌入式软件中广泛应用，但多FSM的同步组合会导致状态空间爆炸问题，编译效率和执行性能亟待优化。

Method: 引入基于图的改写规则和线性时间算法生成FSM，并通过C++模板元编程编码为类型状态程序。

Result: 实验表明，编译时间和生成二进制大小与现有技术相当，执行时间平均快31-60%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了同步程序编译中的状态空间爆炸问题，显著提升了执行性能。

Abstract: Synchronous programs are used extensively in implementation of safety
critical embedded software. Imperative synchronous programming languages model
multiple Finite State Machines (FSMs) executing in lockstep at logical clock
ticks. The synchronous view of time along with the FSM based design enables
easier formal verification. The synchronous composition of multiple FSMs,
during compilation, results in the well known state space explosion problem.
Hence, efficiently compiling imperative synchronous programs into small and
fast executables is challenging. This paper introduces a novel linear time
compilation technique for automata based compilation of synchronous programs.
Graph based rewrite rules for kernel programming constructs are introduced. A
linear time algorithm applies these rules to produce a FSM. The FSM is then
encoded into a type-state program using template meta-programming in C++.
Experimental results show that the compilation time and generated binary size
is comparable, while the execution times are on average 31-60% faster than
current state-of-the-art compilers.

TL;DR: TestWeaver是一种基于LLM的新方法，通过轻量级程序分析指导测试生成，解决了覆盖率停滞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在回归测试生成中因缺乏程序执行推理能力导致覆盖率停滞，TestWeaver旨在通过更有效的引导解决这一问题。

Method: TestWeaver结合了三种创新：1) 使用目标行的反向切片而非完整程序上下文；2) 引入共享控制流相似性的测试用例；3) 添加执行内联注释以增强LLM推理。

Result: 实验证明TestWeaver加速了代码覆盖率增长，并生成了比现有LLM方法更有效的回归测试用例。

Conclusion: TestWeaver通过针对性输入和上下文增强，显著提升了LLM在回归测试生成中的表现。

Abstract: Regression testing ensures that code changes do not unintentionally break
existing functionality. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs)
have shown promise in automating test generation for regression testing, they
often suffer from limited reasoning about program execution, resulting in
stagnated coverage growth - a phenomenon known as the coverage plateau. In this
paper, we present TestWeaver, a novel LLM-based approach that integrates
lightweight program analysis to guide test generation more effectively.
TestWeaver introduces three key innovations: (1) it reduces hallucinations and
improves focus by supplying the LLM with the backward slice from the target
line instead of full program context; (2) it identifies and incorporates close
test cases - those that share control-flow similarities with the path to the
target line - to provide execution context within the LLM's context window; and
(3) it enhances LLM's reasoning with execution in-line annotations that encode
variable states as comments along executed paths. By equipping LLMs with these
targeted and contextualized inputs, TestWeaver improves coverage-guided test
generation and mitigates redundant explorations. Empirical results demonstrate
that TestWeaver accelerates code coverage growth and generates more effective
regression test cases than existing LLM-based approaches.

evaluate thousands of apps daily across diverse devices and OS versions.
Existing techniques based on static analysis or system metrics, while useful,
may not accurately capture user-perceived issues or scale effectively.
  In this experience paper, we present \tool, a lightweight and black-box
technique that measures GUI responsiveness directly from mobile screencasts --
video recordings captured during automated GUI testing. \tool detects user
interactions and visual delays, helping developers identify GUI performance
issues that affect the user experience. It uses computer vision to detect user
interactions and analyzes frame-level visual changes to compute two key
metrics: response time (from user action to first visual feedback) and finish
time (until visual feedback stabilizes). We evaluate \tool on a manually
annotated benchmark of 2,458 interactions from 64 popular Android apps. \tool
achieves 0.96 precision and 0.93 recall in detecting interactions, and measures
response and finish times within 50\,ms and 100\,ms error, respectively, for
over 89\% of interactions. The tool has been deployed in an industrial testing
pipeline and analyzes thousands of screencasts daily, uncovering responsiveness
issues missed by traditional tools and improving performance debugging
efficiency.

TL;DR: CG-FSPTA提出了一种基于流敏感约束图的指针分析方法，显著提高了效率，同时保持了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于控制流图的流敏感指针分析方法存在计算效率低下的问题，CG-FSPTA旨在通过利用约束图的结构优势解决这一问题。

Method: CG-FSPTA采用流敏感约束图（FSConsG），结合图优化和动态求解技术，提升效率。

Result: 实验表明，CG-FSPTA平均减少33.05%内存使用，加速7.27倍，同时保持精度。

Conclusion: CG-FSPTA为大规模软件系统分析提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，为未来程序分析框架的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Flow-sensitive pointer analysis constitutes an essential component of precise
program analysis for accurately modeling pointer behaviors by incorporating
control flows. Flow-sensitive pointer analysis is extensively used in alias
analysis, taint analysis, program understanding, compiler optimization, etc.
Existing flow-sensitive pointer analysis approaches, which are conducted based
on control flow graphs, have significantly advanced the precision of pointer
analysis via sophisticated techniques to leverage control flow information.
However, they inevitably suffer from computational inefficiencies when
resolving points-to information due to the inherent complex structures of
control flow graphs. We present CG-FSPTA, a Flow-Sensitive Constraint Graph
(FSConsG) based flow-sensitive pointer analysis to overcome the inefficiency of
control-flow-graph-based analysis. CG-FSPTA uses a flow-sensitive variant to
leverage the structural advantages of set-constraint graphs (which are commonly
used in flow-insensitive pointer analysis) while keeping the flow sensitivity
of variable definitions and uses, allowing the incorporation of sophisticated
graph optimization and dynamic solving techniques. In this way, CG-FSPTA
achieves significant efficiency improvements while keeping the precision of
flow-sensitive analysis. Experimental evaluations on benchmark programs
demonstrate that CG-FSPTA, significantly reduces both memory usage and
execution time while maintaining precision. In particular, by solving in the
FSConsG, CG-FSPTA achieves an average memory reduction of 33.05\% and
accelerates flow-sensitive pointer analysis by 7.27x compared to the
state-of-art method. These experimental results underscore the efficacy of
CG-FSPTA as a scalable solution to analyze large-scale software systems,
establishing a robust foundation for future advancements in efficient program
analysis frameworks.

*Yunhao Liang,Ruixuan Ying,Takuya Taniguchi,Guwen Lyu,Zhe Cui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LLM筛选和执行验证的两阶段框架，用于检测Python程序中的语义克隆，显著提升了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉功能等效的语义克隆（Type 4），而直接应用LLM效果不佳，需解决这一问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：LLM筛选语义相似代码对，执行验证通过LLM生成测试输入评估功能等效性。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在精确率、召回率和F1分数上显著优于直接LLM检测。

Conclusion: 框架有效识别语义克隆，未来可探索跨语言检测和大规模应用优化。

Abstract: Code clone detection is a critical task in software engineering, aimed at
identifying duplicated or similar code fragments within or across software
systems. Traditional methods often fail to capture functional equivalence,
particularly for semantic clones (Type 4), where code fragments implement
identical functionality despite differing syntactic structures. Recent advances
in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding code
semantics. However, directly applying LLMs to code clone detection yields
suboptimal results due to their sensitivity to syntactic differences. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines
LLM-based screening with execution-based validation for detecting semantic
clones in Python programs. In the first stage, an LLM evaluates code pairs to
filter out obvious non-clones based on semantic analysis. For pairs not
identified as clones, the second stage employs an execution-based validation
approach, utilizing LLM-generated test inputs to assess functional equivalence
through cross-execution validation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates
significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to direct
LLM-based detection, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in identifying
semantic clones. Future work includes exploring cross-language clone detection
and optimizing the framework for large-scale applications.

TL;DR: 论文通过实证验证了基于控制理论的Composite Stability Index (CSI)，发现周提交频率和改进的统计推断能更好地衡量开源项目的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件在全球软件供应链中的重要性日益增加，但其稳定性和可持续性缺乏有效的衡量方法。

Method: 使用控制理论分析100个GitHub仓库，通过提交频率、问题解决率、拉取请求合并率和社区活动等指标计算CSI。

Result: 发现周提交频率比日提交频率更可行，改进统计推断（如使用中位数）能提升稳定性指数的准确性。

Conclusion: 实证结果支持控制理论在开源项目健康评估中的应用，并提供了实际项目监控工具的数据支持。

Abstract: Over the past few decades, open source software has been continuously
integrated into software supply chains worldwide, drastically increasing
reliance and dependence. Because of the role this software plays, it is
important to understand ways to measure and promote its stability and potential
for sustainability. Recent work proposed the use of control theory to
understand repository stability and evaluate repositories' ability to return to
equilibrium after a disturbance such as the introduction of a new feature
request, a spike in bug reports, or even the influx or departure of
contributors. This approach leverages commit frequency patterns, issue
resolution rate, pull request merge rate, and community activity engagement to
provide a Composite Stability Index (CSI). While this framework has theoretical
foundations, there is no empirical validation of the CSI in practice. In this
paper, we present the first empirical validation of the proposed CSI by
experimenting with 100 highly ranked GitHub repositories. Our results suggest
that (1) sampling weekly commit frequency pattern instead of daily is a more
feasible measure of commit frequency stability across repositories and (2)
improved statistical inferences (swapping mean with median), particularly with
ascertaining resolution and review times in issues and pull request, improves
the overall issue and pull request stability index. Drawing on our empirical
dataset, we also derive data-driven half-width parameters that better align
stability scores with real project behavior. These findings both confirm the
viability of a control-theoretic lens on open-source health and provide
concrete, evidence-backed applications for real-world project monitoring tools.

TL;DR: 研究发现，工业环境中系统追踪工具的主要障碍并非技术复杂性，而是专家知识转化为实际洞察的困难、工作流集成问题及对自动化结果的信任缺失。TMLL通过聚焦易用性和透明度的设计解决了这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨工业环境中复杂追踪分析工具采用率低的原因，挑战传统以技术能力为中心的工具开发理念。

Method: 通过与Ericsson合作开发TMLL，结合专家反馈、Eclipse Foundation集成及40名行业和学术专业人士的调查，验证设计原则。

Result: 77.5%的受访者更重视结果质量和信任，67.5%偏好半自动化分析。验证了认知兼容性、嵌入式专业知识和基于透明的信任三大核心原则。

Conclusion: 可持续的工具采用需转向以采用为中心的设计，强调易用性、透明度和用户信任，而非单纯技术能力。

Abstract: System tracing has become essential for understanding complex software
behavior in modern systems, yet sophisticated trace analysis tools face
significant adoption gaps in industrial settings. Through a year-long
collaboration with Ericsson Montr\'eal, developing TMLL (Trace-Server Machine
Learning Library, now in the Eclipse Foundation), we investigated barriers to
trace analysis adoption. Contrary to assumptions about complexity or automation
needs, practitioners struggled with translating expert knowledge into
actionable insights, integrating analysis into their workflows, and trusting
automated results they could not validate. We identified what we called the
Excellence Paradox: technical excellence can actively impede adoption when
conflicting with usability, transparency, and practitioner trust. TMLL
addresses this through adoption-focused design that embeds expert knowledge in
interfaces, provides transparent explanations, and enables incremental
adoption. Validation through Ericsson's experts' feedback, Eclipse Foundation's
integration, and a survey of 40 industry and academic professionals revealed
consistent patterns: survey results showed that 77.5% prioritize quality and
trust in results over technical sophistication, while 67.5% prefer
semi-automated analysis with user control, findings supported by qualitative
feedback from industrial collaboration and external peer review. Results
validate three core principles: cognitive compatibility, embedded expertise,
and transparency-based trust. This challenges conventional capability-focused
tool development, demonstrating that sustainable adoption requires
reorientation toward adoption-focused design with actionable implications for
automated software engineering tools.

TL;DR: MPCO框架通过元提示技术自动生成跨LLM的高质量代码优化提示，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业平台中多LLM部署面临提示工程跨模型不兼容的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: MPCO利用元提示动态整合项目元数据、任务需求和LLM上下文，生成优化提示。

Result: 在五个真实代码库上，MPCO性能提升达19.06%，96%优化来自有效编辑。

Conclusion: MPCO证明元提示技术在多LLM环境中高效，为工业实践提供了可行方案。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated code optimization. However, industrial platforms deploying multiple
LLMs face a critical challenge: prompts optimized for one LLM often fail with
others, requiring expensive model-specific prompt engineering. This cross-model
prompt engineering bottleneck severely limits the practical deployment of
multi-LLM optimization systems in production environments. To address this, we
introduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that
automatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs
while maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages
meta-prompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by
integrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts, and
it seamlessly deploys on the ARTEMIS industrial platform for automated
validation and scaling.
  Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of
runtime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall
performance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all
systems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the
top-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits. Through systematic
ablation studies and meta-prompter sensitivity analysis, we identify that
comprehensive context integration is essential for effective meta-prompting,
and that all three major LLMs can serve effectively as meta-prompters,
providing actionable insights for industrial practitioners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语法测试生成器难以针对特定测试目标生成有效输入，FdLoop旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FdLoop通过迭代选择、演化和学习输入分布，结合测试反馈和概率语法，生成目标特定的测试输入。

Result: 在86%的情况下，FdLoop优于五种基线方法，且在诱导错误行为方面效果是最好基线的两倍。

Conclusion: FdLoop能有效实现单一或多个测试目标，并适应不同参数设置。

Abstract: To effectively test complex software, it is important to generate
goal-specific inputs, i.e., inputs that achieve a specific testing goal.
However, most state-of-the-art test generators are not designed to target
specific goals. Notably, grammar-based test generators, which (randomly)
produce syntactically valid inputs via an input specification (i.e., grammar)
have a low probability of achieving an arbitrary testing goal. This work
addresses this challenge by proposing an automated test generation approach
(called FdLoop) which iteratively learns relevant input properties from
existing inputs to drive the generation of goal-specific inputs. Given a
testing goal, FdLoop iteratively selects, evolves and learn the input
distribution of goal-specific test inputs via test feedback and a probabilistic
grammar. We concretize FdLoop for four testing goals, namely unique code
coverage, input-to-code complexity, program failures (exceptions) and long
execution time. We evaluate FdLoop using three (3) well-known input formats
(JSON, CSS and JavaScript) and 20 open-source software. In most (86%) settings,
FdLoop outperforms all five tested baselines namely the baseline grammar-based
test generators (random, probabilistic and inverse-probabilistic methods),
EvoGFuzz and DynaMosa. FdLoop is (up to) twice (2X) as effective as the best
baseline (EvoGFuzz) in inducing erroneous behaviors. In addition, we show that
the main components of FdLoop (i.e., input mutator, grammar mutator and test
feedbacks) contribute positively to its effectiveness. Finally, our evaluation
demonstrates that FdLoop effectively achieves single testing goals (revealing
erroneous behaviors, generating complex inputs, or inducing long execution
time) and scales to multiple testing goals across varying parameter settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无服务器计算的快速发展，需要了解实际项目中这些工具的使用情况。

Method: 基于Wonderless数据集的方法论，通过新的过滤步骤创建了一个使用Serverless Framework和AWS Lambda的GitHub仓库数据集。

Result: 分析了应用规模、语言、触发方式、项目成熟度和安全性，提供了对当前无服务器架构的深入理解。

Conclusion: OpenLambdaVerse为从业者和研究人员提供了一个有价值的资源，帮助他们更好地理解无服务器工作负载的演变。

Abstract: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is at the core of serverless computing, enabling
developers to easily deploy applications without managing computing resources.
With an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) approach, frameworks like the Serverless
Framework use YAML configurations to define and deploy APIs, tasks, workflows,
and event-driven applications on cloud providers, promoting zero-friction
development. As with any rapidly evolving ecosystem, there is a need for
updated insights into how these tools are used in real-world projects. Building
on the methodology established by the Wonderless dataset for serverless
computing (and applying multiple new filtering steps), OpenLambdaVerse
addresses this gap by creating a dataset of current GitHub repositories that
use the Serverless Framework in applications that contain one or more AWS
Lambda functions. We then analyze and characterize this dataset to get an
understanding of the state-of-the-art in serverless architectures based on this
stack. Through this analysis we gain important insights on the size and
complexity of current applications, which languages and runtimes they employ,
how are the functions triggered, the maturity of the projects, and their
security practices (or lack of). OpenLambdaVerse thus offers a valuable,
up-to-date resource for both practitioners and researchers that seek to better
understand evolving serverless workloads.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在代码生成方面研究广泛，但其在代码修改中的作用尚不明确，且构建有效的修改提示存在挑战。

Method: 研究了两种提示策略：直接指令提示和摘要中介提示，并通过15名开发者的探索性实验验证其效果。

Result: 开发者采用迭代工作流程，两种策略各有优劣，选择取决于任务目标和上下文。

Conclusion: 需要改进提示交互，如可调摘要粒度、可靠的摘要-代码可追溯性和生成摘要的一致性。

Abstract: This paper presents a study of using large language models (LLMs) in
modifying existing code. While LLMs for generating code have been widely
studied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although
"prompting" serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate
intents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification
introduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that
natural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches
have been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study
investigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification:
Direct Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in
free-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by
editing the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study
with 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques
across multiple scenarios. Our findings suggest that developers followed an
iterative workflow: understanding the code, localizing the edit, and validating
outputs through execution or semantic reasoning. Each prompting strategy
presented trade-offs: direct instruction prompting was more flexible and easier
to specify, while summary-mediated prompting supported comprehension, prompt
scaffolding, and control. Developers' choice of strategy was shaped by task
goals and context, including urgency, maintainability, learning intent, and
code familiarity. These findings highlight the need for more usable prompt
interactions, including adjustable summary granularity, reliable summary-code
traceability, and consistency in generated summaries.

Abstract: Training software engineering (SWE) LLMs is bottlenecked by expensive
infrastructure, inefficient evaluation pipelines, scarce training data, and
costly quality control. We present RepoForge, an autonomous, end-to-end
pipeline that generates, evaluates, and trains SWE agents at scale. Our key
contributions include: (1) RepoForge-8B-Agent, achieving 17.4\% on
SWE-Bench-Verified~\citep{swebench_verified2024}, establishing new
state-of-the-art for $\leq$8B non-thinking LLMs; (2) 7,304 executable
environments auto-generated from real GitHub commits with zero manual
intervention; (3) 14$\times$ storage reduction (1.4GB $\rightarrow$ 102MB per
instance) via intelligent dependency management and image pruning; (4) $>$70\%
faster evaluation using a Ray-powered~\citep{ray2018} distributed RepoForge
harness; (5) 19,000$\times$ cheaper labeling through our automated
SPICE~\citep{spice2024} difficulty assessment technique. By unifying
storage-efficient sandboxing, Ray-powered evaluation harness, automated data
generation, SPICE-based labeling, and bubble-free RL scaffold, we demonstrate
that even $\leq$8B models can reach new state-of-the-art performance on
demanding benchmarks like SWE-Bench-Verified. Our approach addresses critical
bottlenecks in SWE agent training: high storage costs of container-based
evaluation, inefficient sequential reward pipelines, limited availability of
high-quality training data, expensive manual labeling, and multi-turn RL
pipeline bottlenecks.

TL;DR: PCREQ是一种自动推断Python第三方库兼容性要求的方法，结合版本和代码兼容性分析，显著提升了兼容性问题的解决效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python第三方库升级常导致兼容性问题，现有工具未能全面解决版本和代码兼容性问题，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: PCREQ通过六个模块（知识获取、版本兼容性评估、API调用提取、代码兼容性评估、版本调整、缺失库补全）自动推断兼容性要求。

Result: PCREQ在REQBench测试中达到94.03%的成功率，显著优于其他工具，平均处理时间为60.79秒。

Conclusion: PCREQ显著减少了手动调试工作，推动了Python依赖维护的自动化。

Abstract: Python third-party libraries (TPLs) are essential in modern software
development, but upgrades often cause compatibility issues, leading to system
failures. These issues fall into two categories: version compatibility issues
(VCIs) and code compatibility issues (CCIs). Existing tools mainly detect
dependency conflicts but overlook code-level incompatibilities, with no
solution fully automating the inference of compatible versions for both VCIs
and CCIs. To fill this gap, we propose PCREQ, the first approach to
automatically infer compatible requirements by combining version and code
compatibility analysis. PCREQ integrates six modules: knowledge acquisition,
version compatibility assessment, invoked APIs and modules extraction, code
compatibility assessment, version change, and missing TPL completion. PCREQ
collects candidate versions, checks for conflicts, identifies API usage,
evaluates code compatibility, and iteratively adjusts versions to generate a
compatible requirements.txt with a detailed repair report. To evaluate PCREQ,
we construct REQBench, a large-scale benchmark with 2,095 upgrade test cases
(including 406 unsolvable by pip). Results show PCREQ achieves a 94.03%
inference success rate, outperforming PyEGo (37.02%), ReadPyE (37.16%), and
LLM-based approaches (GPT-4o, DeepSeek V3/R1) by 18-20%. PCREQ processes each
case from REQBench in 60.79s on average, demonstrating practical efficiency.
PCREQ significantly reduces manual effort in troubleshooting upgrades,
advancing Python dependency maintenance automation.

Abstract: Open-world video games present a broader search space than other games,
posing challenges for test automation. Fuzzing, which generates new inputs by
mutating an initial input, is commonly used to uncover failures. In this study,
we proposed BiFuzz, a two-stage fuzzer designed for automated testing of
open-world video games, and investigated its effectiveness. The results
revealed that BiFuzz mutated the overall strategy of gameplay and test cases,

Motivation: 现有CGRA编译器主要关注数据流，缺乏对控制流的支持，限制了其适用范围。

Method: 提出了模块化编译框架，包含转换和优化步骤，支持任意控制流的应用，并引入新的映射方法解决硬件资源限制。

Result: 框架通过纯编译优化，性能提升达2.1倍。

Conclusion: 控制流可以在编译层面有效管理和优化，扩展了CGRA的应用范围并提升性能。

Abstract: Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) present both high flexibility
and efficiency, making them well-suited for the acceleration of intensive
workloads. Nevertheless, a key barrier towards their widespread adoption is
posed by CGRA compilation, which must cope with a multi-dimensional space
spanning both the spatial and the temporal domains. Indeed, state-of-the-art
compilers are limited in scope as they mostly deal with the data flow of
applications, while having little or no support for control flow. Hence, they
mostly target the mapping of single loops and/or delegate the management of
control flow divergences to ad-hoc hardware units.
  Conversely, in this paper we show that control flow can be effectively
managed and optimized at the compilation level, allowing for a broad set of
applications to be targeted while being hardware-agnostic and achieving high
performance. We embody our methodology in a modular compilation framework
consisting of transformation and optimization passes, enabling support for
applications with arbitrary control flows running on abstract CGRA meshes. We
also introduce a novel mapping methodology that acts as a compilation back-end,
addressing the limitations in available CGRA hardware resources and
guaranteeing a feasible solution in the compilation process. Our framework
achieves up to 2.1X speedups over state-of-the-art approaches, purely through
compilation optimizations.

Motivation: 传统测试方法在HIDE中隔离测试工具，导致开发流程中断，影响注意力。

Method: 开发了一个提供运行时测试表示的库，实现与HIDE的紧密集成。

Conclusion: 该库优化了开发流程，通过快速测试反馈保持开发者专注。

Abstract: Highly interactive development environments (HIDEs) enable uninterrupted
development flow through continuous program evolution and rapid hypothesis
checking. However, traditional testing approaches -- typically executed
separately via CLI -- isolate tests from HIDE tooling (interactive debuggers,
value and stack inspectors, etc.) and introduce disruptive delays due to coarse
execution granularity and lack of runtime context. This disconnect breaks
development flow by exceeding critical attention thresholds. In this paper we
present a library that provides runtime representation for tests, allowing
tight integration with HIDEs, and enabling immediate access to HIDE tooling in
the context of test failure. We then describe development workflows enhanced
with testing and demonstrate how they achieve subsecond test reexecution times

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在软件工程研究中的应用，特别是仓库挖掘任务（MSR）。通过混合方法研究，提出了PRIMES 2.0框架，以提升LLM4MSR研究的透明性和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在MSR研究中日益流行，但其方法学整合仍缺乏深入理解。现有研究多关注特定能力或性能基准，未能全面揭示LLMs在整个研究流程中的应用。

Method: 采用混合方法研究，结合快速综述和问卷调查，分析LLM4MSR领域的研究方法和威胁。

Result: 识别了15种方法学方法、9种主要威胁及25种缓解策略，并提出了PRIMES 2.0框架，包含6个阶段和23个子步骤。

Conclusion: PRIMES 2.0框架为LLM-based MSR研究提供了透明且可重复的方法学支持，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software engineering
research, offering new opportunities for automating repository mining tasks.
However, despite their growing popularity, the methodological integration of
LLMs into Mining Software Repositories (MSR) remains poorly understood.
Existing studies tend to focus on specific capabilities or performance
benchmarks, providing limited insight into how researchers utilize LLMs across
the full research pipeline. To address this gap, we conduct a mixed-method
study that combines a rapid review and questionnaire survey in the field of
LLM4MSR. We investigate (1) the approaches and (2) the threats that affect the
empirical rigor of researchers involved in this field. Our findings reveal 15
methodological approaches, nine main threats, and 25 mitigation strategies.
Building on these findings, we present PRIMES 2.0, a refined empirical
framework organized into six stages, comprising 23 methodological substeps,
each mapped to specific threats and corresponding mitigation strategies,
providing prescriptive and adaptive support throughout the lifecycle of
LLM-based MSR studies. Our work contributes to establishing a more transparent
and reproducible foundation for LLM-based MSR research.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的测试方法（RVSG），用于生成违反工业自主移动机器人（AMR）功能和安全要求的多样化人类行为，以测试其安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类行为不可预测且真实环境测试成本高、风险大，需要一种高效的方法来测试AMR的安全性。

Method: 利用VLM生成违反要求的人类行为，并在模拟器中评估AMR的反应。

Result: RVSG能有效生成违反要求的场景，并增加机器人行为的多样性，揭示其不确定性。

Conclusion: RVSG是一种高效且安全的测试方法，适用于工业AMR的安全性验证。

Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are deployed in diverse environments (e.g.,
warehouses, retail spaces, and offices), where they work alongside humans.
Given that human behavior can be unpredictable and that AMRs may not have been
trained to handle all possible unknown and uncertain behaviors, it is important
to test AMRs under a wide range of human interactions to ensure their safe
behavior. Moreover, testing in real environments with actual AMRs and humans is
often costly, impractical, and potentially hazardous (e.g., it could result in
human injury). To this end, we propose a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based
testing approach (RVSG) for industrial AMRs developed by PAL Robotics in Spain.
Based on the functional and safety requirements, RVSG uses the VLM to generate
diverse human behaviors that violate these requirements. We evaluated RVSG with
several requirements and navigation routes in a simulator using the latest AMR
from PAL Robotics. Our results show that, compared with the baseline, RVSG can
effectively generate requirement-violating scenarios. Moreover, RVSG-generated
scenarios increase variability in robot behavior, thereby helping reveal their
uncertain behaviors.

TL;DR: JC-Finder是一种新的基于克隆的SCA工具，专门用于Java项目中TPL重用的识别，具有高准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TPL的混乱管理和未经授权的源代码使用对软件维护和版权问题构成威胁，现有工具对Java的克隆检测不足。

Method: JC-Finder通过类级特征捕获、维护函数间关系并排除冗余元素，实现高效识别。

Result: 在测试中，JC-Finder的F1得分为0.818，速度比同类工具快9倍，并发现26.20%未声明的TPL。

Conclusion: JC-Finder填补了Java克隆检测工具的空白，显著提升了TPL重用的识别能力。

Abstract: While reusing third-party libraries (TPL) facilitates software development,
its chaotic management has brought great threats to software maintenance and
the unauthorized use of source code also raises ethical problems such as
misconduct on copyrighted code. To identify TPL reuse in projects, Software
Composition Analysis (SCA) is employed, and two categories of SCA techniques
are used based on how TPLs are introduced: clone-based SCA and
package-manager-based SCA (PM-based SCA). Although introducing TPLs by clones
is prevalent in Java, no clone-based SCA tools are specially designed for Java.
Also, directly applying clone-based SCA techniques from other tools is
problematic. To fill this gap, we introduce JC-Finder, a novel clone-based SCA
tool that aims to accurately and comprehensively identify instances of TPL
reuse introduced by source code clones in Java projects. JC-Finder achieves
both accuracy and efficiency in identifying TPL reuse from code cloning by
capturing features at the class level, maintaining inter-function
relationships, and excluding trivial or duplicated elements. To evaluate the
efficiency of JC-Finder, we applied it to 9,965 most popular Maven libraries as
reference data and tested the TPL reuse of 1,000 GitHub projects. The result
shows that JC-Finder achieved an F1-score of 0.818, outperforming the other
function-level tool by 0.427. The average time taken for resolving TPL reuse is
14.2 seconds, which is approximately 9 times faster than the other tool. We
further applied JC-Finder to 7,947 GitHub projects, revealing TPL reuse by code
clones in 789 projects (about 9.89% of all projects) and identifying a total of
2,142 TPLs. JC-Finder successfully detects 26.20% more TPLs that are not
explicitly declared in package managers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于量子机器学习的测试预言框架QuReBot，用于自主移动机器人的回归测试，相比传统神经网络降低了15%的预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人软件升级后需要回归测试，但由于环境不确定性，确定其正确行为（测试预言）具有挑战性。

Method: 提出混合框架QuReBot，结合量子储备计算（QRC）和简单神经网络，预测机器人行为。

Result: QRC单独使用时无法收敛，而QuReBot收敛且预测误差比传统神经网络降低15%。

Conclusion: QuReBot在机器人软件测试中表现更优，论文还提供了配置建议以支持未来测试。

Abstract: Robots are increasingly becoming part of our daily lives, interacting with
both the environment and humans to perform their tasks. The software of such
robots often undergoes upgrades, for example, to add new functionalities, fix
bugs, or delete obsolete functionalities. As a result, regression testing of
robot software becomes necessary. However, determining the expected correct
behavior of robots (i.e., a test oracle) is challenging due to the potentially
unknown environments in which the robots must operate. To address this
challenge, machine learning (ML)-based test oracles present a viable solution.
This paper reports on the development of a test oracle to support regression
testing of autonomous mobile robots built by PAL Robotics (Spain), using
quantum machine learning (QML), which enables faster training and the
construction of more precise test oracles. Specifically, we propose a hybrid
framework, QuReBot, that combines both quantum reservoir computing (QRC) and a
simple neural network, inspired by residual connection, to predict the expected
behavior of a robot. Results show that QRC alone fails to converge in our case,
yielding high prediction error. In contrast, QuReBot converges and achieves 15%
reduction of prediction error compared to the classical neural network
baseline. Finally, we further examine QuReBot under different configurations
and offer practical guidance on optimal settings to support future robot
software testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码补全系统依赖手工启发式或轻量级机器学习模型，难以捕捉上下文信息并泛化到不同项目和编码风格。

Method: 将所有有效补全组织为前缀树，通过单次贪婪解码收集令牌级分数，无需束搜索或模型适配。

Result: 方法快速、架构无关，且兼容现有代码补全模型，能更智能地提供开发者辅助。

Conclusion: 为IDE中集成语言模型提供了一种实用有效的方式，提升了代码补全的响应性和智能性。

Abstract: Token-level code completion is one of the most critical features in modern
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). It assists developers by suggesting
relevant identifiers and APIs during coding. While completions are typically
derived from static analysis, their usefulness depends heavily on how they are
ranked, as correct predictions buried deep in the list are rarely seen by
users. Most current systems rely on hand-crafted heuristics or lightweight
machine learning models trained on user logs, which can be further improved to
capture context information and generalize across projects and coding styles.
In this work, we propose a new scoring approach to ranking static completions
using language models in a lightweight and model-agnostic way. Our method
organizes all valid completions into a prefix tree and performs a single greedy
decoding pass to collect token-level scores across the tree. This enables a
precise token-aware ranking without needing beam search, prompt engineering, or
model adaptations. The approach is fast, architecture-agnostic, and compatible
with already deployed models for code completion. These findings highlight a
practical and effective pathway for integrating language models into already
existing tools within IDEs, and ultimately providing smarter and more
responsive developer assistance.

Motivation: 现有AI工具依赖显式自然语言指令且延迟高，难以融入开发流程。开发者历史编辑模式能反映其意图和习惯，可作为解决方案的关键。

Method: 采用双模型架构，基于SFT和DAPO数据集训练，实现无指令、低延迟的代码编辑建议。

Result: 在预测编辑位置任务中准确率达75.6%和81.6%，意图对齐编辑的ES和EMR分别为91.36%和27.7%，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: NES是高效、可扩展的工业级解决方案，已成功应用于金融科技公司，开源数据集提升CodeLLMs性能。

Abstract: Code editing, including modifying, refactoring, and maintaining existing
code, is the most frequent task in software development and has garnered
significant attention from AI-powered tools. However, existing solutions that
translate explicit natural language instructions into code edits face critical
limitations, such as heavy reliance on human instruction input and high
latency, which hinder their effective integration into a developer's workflow.
We observe that developers' habitual behaviors and coding objectives are often
reflected in their historical editing patterns, making this data key to
addressing existing limitations. To leverage these insights, we propose NES
(Next Edit Suggestion), an LLM-driven code editing framework that delivers an
instruction-free and low-latency experience. Built on a dual-model architecture
and trained with our high-quality SFT and DAPO datasets, NES enhances
productivity by understanding developer intent while optimizing inference to
minimize latency. NES is a scalable, industry-ready solution with a continuous
Tab key interaction workflow, seamlessly adopted by a FinTech company with over
20,000 developers. Evaluations on real-world datasets show NES achieves 75.6%
and 81.6% accuracy in two tasks of predicting next edit locations, alongside
91.36% ES and 27.7% EMR for intent-aligned edits, outperforming SOTA models.
Our open-sourced SFT and DAPO datasets have been demonstrated to enhance the
performance of open-source CodeLLMs. The demonstration of NES is available at

TL;DR: 论文研究了开源软件项目的韧性，提出通过提交频率模式评估项目稳定性，发现仅有少数项目能在不同时间粒度上保持稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源软件对全球技术基础设施的重要性增加，理解项目韧性（应对干扰后恢复正常的能力）变得至关重要。

Method: 基于复合稳定性指数（CSI）框架，分析了100个高排名仓库的提交频率模式。

Result: 仅2%的仓库表现出每日稳定性，29%达到每周稳定性，50%为每月稳定性，而一半仓库在所有时间粒度上都不稳定。区块链和编程语言项目最稳定。

Conclusion: 项目稳定性可通过更多指标（如问题解决时间、PR合并率）丰富，以更全面评估韧性和风险。

Abstract: Open source software (OSS) generates trillions of dollars in economic value
and has become essential to technical infrastructures worldwide. As
organizations increasingly depend on OSS, understanding project evolution is
critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one
dimension remains understudied: project resilience -- the ability to return to
normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures, security
vulnerabilities, and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit
patterns reflect underlying project characteristics such as mature governance,
sustained contributors, and robust development processes that enable
resilience. Building on the Composite Stability Index (CSI) framework, we
empirically validate commit frequency patterns across 100 highly ranked
repositories. Our findings reveal that only 2\% of repositories exhibit daily
stability, 29\% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly
stability, while half remain unstable across all temporal levels. Programming
languages and blockchain applications were the most stable. We identified two
exemplary repositories that achieved stability at all three granularities,
whose governance models, CI cadence, and release policies could serve as
reference frameworks. We observed that large yearly commit throughput does not
necessarily correlate with stability. Beyond commits, stability can be enriched
with issue-resolution times, PR merge rates, and community-engagement metrics
to broaden resilience assessment and sharpen stability-based risk evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源社区的技术文档多语言化需求未被满足，而LLMs在翻译领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 评估了50个README文件的英文到德文翻译，比较了ChatGPT 4和Claude的表现，并提出了TRIFID框架。

Result: LLMs能提供准确翻译，但在保留结构组件（如超链接）和格式一致性方面存在挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs在文档国际化中具有潜力，但需解决保真度问题；TRIFID为自动化翻译支持提供了初步基础。

Abstract: While open source communities attract diverse contributors globally, few
repositories provide essential documentation in languages other than English.
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
software engineering tasks and translations across domains. However, little is
known about LLM capabilities in translating open-source technical
documentation, which mixes natural language, code, URLs, and markdown
formatting. To understand the need and potential for LLMs in technical
documentation translation, we evaluated community translation activity and
English-to-German translations of 50 README files using OpenAI's ChatGPT 4 and
Anthropic's Claude. We found scarce translation activity, mostly in larger
repositories and community-driven in nature. LLM performance comparison
suggests they can provide accurate translations. However, analysis revealed
fidelity challenges: both models struggled to preserve structural components
(e.g., hyperlinks) and exhibited formatting inconsistencies. These findings
highlight both promise and challenges of LLM-assisted documentation
internationalization. As a first step toward translation-aware continuous
integration pipelines, we introduce TRIFID, an early-stage translation fidelity
scoring framework that automatically checks how well translations preserve
code, links, and formatting. Our efforts provide a foundation for automated
LLM-driven support for creating and maintaining open source documentation.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has rapidly grown in popularity, becoming vital to many
industries. Currently, the research on code smells in ML applications lacks
tools and studies that address the identification and validity of ML-specific
code smells. This work investigates suitable methods and tools to design and
develop a static code analysis tool (MLpylint) based on code smell criteria.
This research employed the Design Science Methodology. In the problem
identification phase, a literature review was conducted to identify ML-specific
code smells. In solution design, a secondary literature review and
consultations with experts were performed to select methods and tools for
implementing the tool. We evaluated the tool on data from 160 open-source ML
applications sourced from GitHub. We also conducted a static validation through
an expert survey involving 15 ML professionals. The results indicate the
effectiveness and usefulness of the MLpylint. We aim to extend our current
approach by investigating ways to introduce MLpylint seamlessly into
development workflows, fostering a more productive and innovative developer
environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件开发的复杂性不仅限于代码实现，还包括代码维护。现有方法在大型代码库中定位错误时效率不足，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出Meta-RAG方法，通过信息检索和LLM智能体，将代码库压缩为紧凑的自然语言表示，并定位错误。

Result: 在SWE-bench Lite数据集上，Meta-RAG的文件级和函数级错误定位准确率分别为84.67%和53.0%，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Meta-RAG通过结合信息检索和LLM，显著提高了大型代码库中错误定位的效率，为软件开发自动化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such
domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of
a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex
ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the
realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to
localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and
LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an
average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation.
We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical
for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of
Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores
84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization
rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统合成控制方法（SCM）在处理控制单元多于时间周期的情况时存在局限性，需要一种更灵活的方法来优化权重分配和预测准确性。

Method: 提出SCM-relaxation算法，通过最小化信息论度量权重，并引入松弛线性不等式约束和单纯形约束，优化反事实预测。当控制单元具有分组结构时，算法近似每组内的等权重以分散预测风险。

Result: 理论证明所提出的估计器在样本外预测准确性方面达到最优性能。蒙特卡洛模拟和实证应用（评估脱欧对英国实际GDP的影响）验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SCM-relaxation算法在控制单元多于时间周期的情况下表现出色，能够有效优化权重分配并提高预测准确性，适用于实际经济问题。

Abstract: The synthetic control method (SCM) is widely used for constructing the
counterfactual of a treated unit based on data from control units in a donor
pool. Allowing the donor pool contains more control units than time periods, we
propose a novel machine learning algorithm, named SCM-relaxation, for
counterfactual prediction. Our relaxation approach minimizes an
information-theoretic measure of the weights subject to a set of relaxed linear
inequality constraints in addition to the simplex constraint. When the donor
pool exhibits a group structure, SCM-relaxation approximates the equal weights
within each group to diversify the prediction risk. Asymptotically, the
proposed estimator achieves oracle performance in terms of out-of-sample
prediction accuracy. We demonstrate our method by Monte Carlo simulations and
by an empirical application that assesses the economic impact of Brexit on the
United Kingdom's real GDP.

Motivation: 在面板数据的DID设计中，现有方法（如AIPW DID）在模型局部误设时表现不佳，因此需要一种更稳健且高效的估计方法。

Method: 提出协变量平衡倾向得分（CBPS）DID估计器，通过协变量平衡优化ATT估计。

Result: CBPS DID在模拟和实证研究中表现出良好的有限样本性能，优于AIPW DID。

Conclusion: CBPS DID是一种理论优越且实用的ATT估计方法，特别适用于面板数据DID设计。

Abstract: This article develops a covariate balancing approach for the estimation of
treatment effects on the treated (ATT) in a difference-in-differences (DID)
research design when panel data are available. We show that the proposed
covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) DID estimator possesses several
desirable properties: (i) local efficiency, (ii) double robustness in terms of
consistency, (iii) double robustness in terms of inference, and (iv) faster
convergence to the ATT compared to the augmented inverse probability weighting
(AIPW) DID estimators when both working models are locally misspecified. These
latter two characteristics set the CBPS DID estimator apart from the AIPW DID
estimator theoretically. Simulation studies and an empirical study demonstrate
the desirable finite sample performance of the proposed estimator.

Method: 综述了农业和应用经济学中常用的因果效应估计方法，并提出了评估和讨论识别策略的指南。

Result: 提供了利用观测数据估计因果效应的实用建议，强调了识别假设的重要性。

Conclusion: 农业和应用经济学家在使用观测数据时需谨慎评估识别策略，以确保因果效应的可靠性。

Abstract: Most research questions in agricultural and applied economics are of a causal
nature, i.e., how one or more variables (e.g., policies, prices, the weather)
affect one or more other variables (e.g., income, crop yields, pollution). Only
some of these research questions can be studied experimentally. Most empirical
studies in agricultural and applied economics thus rely on observational data.
However, estimating causal effects with observational data requires appropriate
research designs and a transparent discussion of all identifying assumptions,
together with empirical evidence to assess the probability that they hold. This
paper provides an overview of various approaches that are frequently used in
agricultural and applied economics to estimate causal effects with

Motivation: 研究教育支出变化对地方经济结果的影响，利用学校公投数据。

Method: 将结果嵌入空间均衡模型，结合多数投票规则，识别结构参数并模拟反事实公投效果。

Result: 在威斯康星州的应用中，发现住房价格资本化在公投通过率上存在显著异质性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够将RDD估计推广到非边际公投情景，为政策分析提供支持。

Abstract: We propose a structural approach to extrapolate average partial effects away
from the cutoff in regression discontinuity designs (RDDs). Our focus is on
applications that exploit closely contested school district referenda to
estimate the effects of changes in education spending on local economic
outcomes. We embed these outcomes in a spatial equilibrium model of local
jurisdictions in which fiscal policy is determined by majority rule voting.
This integration provides a microfoundation for the running variable, the share
of voters who approve a ballot initiative, and enables identification of
structural parameters using RDD coefficients. We then leverage the model to
simulate the effects of counterfactual referenda over a broad range of proposed
spending changes. These scenarios imply realizations of the running variable
away from the threshold, allowing extrapolation of RDD estimates to nonmarginal
referenda. Applying the method to school expenditure ballot measures in
Wisconsin, we document substantial heterogeneity in housing price
capitalization across the approval margin.

TL;DR: 研究关税如何通过非齐次偏好和互补部门影响经济结构和福利，发现关税提高会短期内增加制造业份额和福利，但若贸易伙伴报复则福利下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨关税在非齐次偏好和互补部门背景下对经济结构和福利的影响，揭示其与传统贸易保护角色的不同作用。

Method: 定性分析关税机制，并采用定量动态模型模拟2001年以来美国制造业关税提高20个百分点的影响。

Result: 关税提高使制造业增加值份额上升1个百分点，福利增加0.36%；但若贸易伙伴报复，福利下降0.12%。

Conclusion: 关税对经济结构和福利的影响取决于贸易伙伴的反应，单边行动可能有利，但多边报复会抵消收益。

Abstract: We examine how tariffs affect sectoral composition and welfare in an economy
with nonhomothetic preferences and sectors being complements -- key drivers of
structural change. Beyond their conventional role in trade protection, tariffs
influence industrial structure by altering relative prices and income levels.
We qualitatively characterize these mechanisms and use a quantitative dynamic
model to show that a counterfactual 20-percentage-point increase in U.S.
manufacturing tariffs since 2001 would have raised the manufacturing
value-added share by one percentage point and increased welfare by 0.36
percent. However, if all the U.S. trading partners responded reciprocally, U.S.
welfare would decline by 0.12 percent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究信念对决策和行为的影响时，遗漏变量偏差和伦理问题是主要挑战。传统信息提供实验可能违反排除限制假设或涉及欺骗。

Result: 通过八个实验验证了ABCD方法的有效性和局限性。

Conclusion: ABCD方法为实验社会科学提供了新的研究工具，避免了传统方法的缺陷。

Abstract: A central challenge in any study of the effects of beliefs on outcomes, such
as decisions and behavior, is the risk of omitted variables bias. Omitted
variables, frequently unmeasured or even unknown, can induce correlations
between beliefs and decisions that are not genuinely causal, in which case the
omitted variables are referred to as confounders. To address the challenge of
causal inference, researchers frequently rely on information provision
experiments to randomly manipulate beliefs. The information supplied in these
experiments can serve as an instrumental variable (IV), enabling causal
inference, so long as it influences decisions exclusively through its impact on
beliefs. However, providing varying information to participants to shape their
beliefs can raise both methodological and ethical concerns. Methodological
concerns arise from potential violations of the exclusion restriction
assumption. Such violations may stem from information source effects, when
attitudes toward the source affect the outcome decision directly, thereby
introducing a confounder. An ethical concern arises from manipulating the
provided information, as it may involve deceiving participants. This paper
proposes and empirically demonstrates a new method for treating beliefs and
estimating their effects, the Anchoring-Based Causal Design (ABCD), which
avoids deception and source influences. ABCD combines the cognitive mechanism
known as anchoring with instrumental variable (IV) estimation. Instead of
providing substantive information, the method employs a deliberately
non-informative procedure in which participants compare their self-assessment
of a concept to a randomly assigned anchor value. We present the method and the
results of eight experiments demonstrating its application, strengths, and
limitations. We conclude by discussing the potential of this design for
advancing experimental social science.

Method: 采用交互效应面板数据中的结构断裂分析方法。

Result: 数字支付显著影响区域收入和消费，断裂点后影响更大；零售支付模型断裂由COVID-19引起，批发支付模型断裂与央行政策相关。

Abstract: Using a panel payment system dataset of thirty-three provinces in Indonesia,
we examine the impact of digital payment on the regional economy, considering
structural breaks induced by unprecedented events and policies. Digital
payments were determined to significantly affect regional income and
consumption before and after the identified breakpoint, with the impact greater
following the break. Employing a novel method for structural break analysis
within interactive effects panel data, we demonstrate that the break in retail
payment models is due to COVID-19, and the break in the wholesale payment model
is associated with the central bank's payment system policy.

Abstract: Behavioural finance offers a valuable framework for examining foreign
exchange (FX) market dynamics, including puzzles such as excess volatility and
fat-tailed distributions. Yet, when it comes to their interaction with the
`real' side of the economy, existing scholarship has overlooked a critical
feature of developing countries. They cannot trade in their national currencies
and need US dollars to access modern production techniques as well as maintain
consumption patterns similar to those of wealthier societies. To address this
gap, we present a novel heterogeneous agents model from the perspective of a
developing economy that distinguishes between speculative and non-speculative
sectors in the FX market. We demonstrate that as long as non-speculative demand
responds to domestic economic activity, a market-clearing output growth rate
exists that, in steady-state, is equal to the ratio between FX supply growth
and the income elasticity of demand for foreign assets, i.e., a generalised
dynamic trade-multiplier. Numerical simulations reproduce key stylised facts of
exchange rate dynamics and economic growth, including distributions that
deviate from the typical bell-shaped curve. Data from a sample of Latin
American countries reveal that FX fluctuations exhibit similar statistical
properties. Furthermore, we employ time-varying parameter estimation techniques
to show that the dynamic trade-multiplier closely tracks observed growth rates
in these economies.

Abstract: Stablecoins have become a foundational component of the digital asset
ecosystem, with their market capitalization exceeding 230 billion USD as of May
2025. As fiat-referenced and programmable assets, stablecoins provide
low-latency, globally interoperable infrastructure for payments, decentralized
finance, DeFi, and tokenized commerce. Their accelerated adoption has prompted
extensive regulatory engagement, exemplified by the European Union's Markets in
Crypto-assets Regulation, MiCA, the US Guiding and Establishing National
Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, GENIUS Act, and Hong Kong's Stablecoins
Bill. Despite this momentum, academic research remains fragmented across
economics, law, and computer science, lacking a unified framework for design,
evaluation, and application. This study addresses that gap through a
multi-method research design. First, it synthesizes cross-disciplinary
literature to construct a taxonomy of stablecoin systems based on custodial
structure, stabilization mechanism, and governance. Second, it develops a
performance evaluation framework tailored to diverse stakeholder needs,
supported by an open-source benchmarking pipeline to ensure transparency and
reproducibility. Third, a case study on Real World Asset tokenization
illustrates how stablecoins operate as programmable monetary infrastructure in
cross-border digital systems. By integrating conceptual theory with empirical
tools, the paper contributes: a unified taxonomy for stablecoin design; a
stakeholder-oriented performance evaluation framework; an empirical case
linking stablecoins to sectoral transformation; and reproducible methods and
datasets to inform future research. These contributions support the development
of trusted, inclusive, and transparent digital monetary infrastructure.

Motivation: 探讨在接收者可能误解信息的情况下，发送者如何设计信息结构以实现长期最优说服效果。

Method: 发送者采用固定信息结构，接收者基于贝叶斯因子规则决定是否切换。分析BP最优结构在长期中的表现。

Result: 当接收者无法从发送者偏好的行为推断状态时，BP最优结构仍适用；否则，完全披露可能更优。

Conclusion: 信息设计面临战略挑战，接收者对信号的解读随时间演变。

Abstract: We study a long-run persuasion problem where a long-lived Sender repeatedly
interacts with a sequence of short-lived Receivers who may adopt a misspecified
model for belief updating. The Sender commits to a stationary information
structure, but suspicious Receivers compare it to an uninformative alternative
and may switch based on the Bayes factor rule. We characterize when the
one-shot Bayesian Persuasion-optimal (BP-optimal) structure remains optimal in
the long run despite this switching risk. In particular, when Receivers cannot
infer the state from the Sender's preferred action, they never switch, and the
BP-optimal structure maximizes the Sender's lifetime utility. In contrast, when
such inference is possible, full disclosure may outperform BP-optimal. Our
findings highlight the strategic challenges of information design when the
Receivers' interpretation of signals evolves over time.

Conclusion: 该机制为完全信息博弈提供了一种无中介的解决方案，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: This paper investigates the implementation and performance of a decentralized
information transmission mechanism in complete information games. We propose a
mediator-free mechanism that realizes mediator-free irrational correlated
equilibria through a finite sequence of cheap talk. Designed for environments
with at least five players, the mechanism leverages encryption techniques to
safeguard private information and strategic choices. The core procedure
involves three players decomposing and encrypting the equilibrium, while two
other players securely randomize and deliver the encrypted recommendations to
designated players. Our results demonstrate that all irrational correlated
equilibria can be achieved through this mechanism, which is both strategically
robust and practically implementable.

Result: 最优救助规则为阈值-线性-上限形式，并提供了动态可信的无救助机制。

Conclusion: 模型为政策制定提供了模板，并明确了未来校准所需的微观数据。

Abstract: Newfoundland and Labrador's municipalities face severe soft-budget pressures
due to narrow tax bases, high fixed service costs, and volatile resource
revenues. We develop a Stackelberg-style mechanism-design model in which the
province commits at initial stage to an ex-ante grant schedule and an ex-post
bailout rule. Municipalities privately observe their fiscal-need type, choose
effort, investment, and debt, and may receive bailouts when deficits exceed a
statutory threshold. Under convexity and single-crossing (or virtual
monotonicity with ironing), the problem reduces to one-dimensional screening
and admits a tractable transfer mechanism with quadratic bailout costs and a
statutory cap. The optimal rule is threshold--linear--cap: no bailouts below a
participation cutoff; a linear ramp-up up to a cap; and a hard cap thereafter.
A knife-edge inequality yields a self-consistent no-bailout regime, and an
explicit discount-factor threshold renders hard budgets dynamically credible.
The closed-form characterisation provides a policy template that maps to
Newfoundland's institutions and clarifies the micro-data required for future
calibration.

Result: 高频率活动时，OCGs分散控制区域，暴力低；低频率时，高收入区域暴力增加。

Conclusion: 政策干预需考虑收入分布和OCGs活动频率，避免单一暴力驱动策略的负面影响。

Abstract: In this work, we provide empirical evidence on organized criminal groups'
(OCGs) behavior across the Liverpool area in the U.K. (Merseyside). We find
that violent crimes concerning OCGs concentrate in the areas yielding the
highest revenue, while OGCs primarily control areas yielding middle or low
revenue. We explain and generalize these empirical observations with a
theoretical model examining how OCGs strategically select which area to exploit
based on expected revenue and the presence of other OCGs. We prove our results
for three OCGs analytically and extend them to larger numbers of OCGs through
numerical simulations. Both approaches suggest that, when the frequency of OCG
activity is sufficiently high, each OCG controls one area, while the violence
between OCGs remains low across all areas. When the frequency of OCG activity
reduces, violent collisions between OCGs occur in the areas yielding the
highest revenue, while some OCGs retain control over the medium-revenue areas.
Our results suggest important policy recommendations. Firstly, if interventions
are only violence-driven, they might miss critical underlying factors.
Secondly, police operations might have unintended negative externalities in
other areas of a city when they target criminal property rights, like increased
violence in the areas yielding the highest revenue.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI脑肿瘤分割对临床诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但现有方法在大型异构数据集上表现不足。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 残差引导的DDPM进行跨模态合成；2) 轻量级U-Net结合残差图和多模态输入进行分割。

Result: 在BraTS 2021上，Dice分数93.02%，IoU 86.7%，优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了分割精度和可扩展性，适用于多中心MRI数据集。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical
diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage
framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more
heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth
masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis
by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual
maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as
spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a
lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed
as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and
FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased
scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude
non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance
precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU
of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset,
outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU:
$85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world,
multi-center MRI datasets.

Conclusion: Mobile U-ViT是一种高效、强大且泛化能力强的解决方案，适用于移动医学图像分析。

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient
execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile
models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical
tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and
medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical
imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing
lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we
propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)
tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly
purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a
parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This
design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being
lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we
introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively
balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of
medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer
bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with
downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced
computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering
diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen
datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and
generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at
https://github.com/FengheTan9/Mobile-U-ViT.

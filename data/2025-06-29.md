TL;DR: 论文讨论了AI安全的重要性，提出了构建可信生态系统的框架，并通过国际会议和报告明确了AI安全研究的三个关键领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力的快速提升，确保其安全性（可信、可靠、安全）成为关键问题，需要构建可信生态系统以促进创新并避免负面影响。

Method: 通过2025年新加坡AI安全会议及国际AI安全报告，采用深度防御模型，将AI安全研究分为开发、评估和控制三大领域。

Result: 明确了AI安全研究的三个核心挑战：开发可信AI系统、评估风险以及部署后的监控与干预。

Conclusion: 构建可信的AI生态系统是确保AI安全的关键，需通过国际合作和多领域研究实现。

Abstract: Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of
transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI
is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem
is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives
maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.
  The "2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific
Exchange on AI Safety" aimed to support research in this space by bringing
together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research
priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI
Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By
adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research
domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems
(Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and
challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).

### [2] [MAGPIE: A dataset for Multi-AGent contextual PrIvacy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20737)
*Gurusha Juneja,Alon Albalak,Wenyue Hua,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLM代理在协作任务中是否理解上下文隐私，并评估了现有模型在保护隐私方面的表现。结果表明，当前模型在隐私保护和任务完成方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理的广泛应用，隐私保护在多代理协作任务中变得至关重要。论文旨在评估LLM代理是否能在非对抗性多轮对话中保护用户隐私。

Method: 提出了一个名为MAGPIE的基准测试，包含158个高风险场景，用于评估LLM代理对上下文隐私的理解和隐私保护能力。

Result: 实验显示，当前模型（如GPT-4o和Claude-2.7-Sonnet）在隐私分类和多轮对话中泄露隐私的比例较高，且多代理系统在71%的场景中无法完成任务。

Conclusion: 当前模型在上下文隐私保护和协作任务解决方面尚未达到理想水平，亟需改进。

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态上下文感知的提示推荐系统，用于领域特定的AI应用，通过多阶段推理和自适应模板生成高质量提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM应用对用户提示质量敏感，而领域特定应用中高质量提示的生成尤为困难。

Method: 结合上下文查询分析、检索增强知识基础、分层技能组织和自适应技能排名，利用行为遥测和两阶段分层推理动态生成提示。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证了系统的高实用性和相关性，得到自动化和专家评估的认可。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效提升领域特定应用中提示的质量和实用性。

Abstract: LLM-powered applications are highly susceptible to the quality of user
prompts, and crafting high-quality prompts can often be challenging especially
for domain-specific applications. This paper presents a novel dynamic
context-aware prompt recommendation system for domain-specific AI applications.
Our solution combines contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge
grounding, hierarchical skill organization, and adaptive skill ranking to
generate relevant and actionable prompt suggestions.
  The system leverages behavioral telemetry and a two-stage hierarchical
reasoning process to dynamically select and rank relevant skills, and
synthesizes prompts using both predefined and adaptive templates enhanced with
few-shot learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves high usefulness and relevance, as validated by both automated
and expert evaluations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种框架，用于预测语言模型建议在社会系统中的长期影响，并引入了一个测试模型间接危害意识的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在社会决策中的影响力增加，确保其建议的积极影响需要理解其长期宏观影响。

Method: 提出了一个概念验证框架，用于模拟模型建议在社会系统中的传播，并引入了一个包含100个间接危害场景的数据集。

Result: 新数据集上性能提升超过20%，现有安全基准测试中平均胜率超过70%。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更安全的语言模型代理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes
societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial
impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their
suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how
model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a
macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks
(AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer
agents.

### [5] [Unveiling Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: Reality or Mirage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21215)
*Haoang Chi,He Li,Wenjing Yang,Feng Liu,Long Lan,Xiaoguang Ren,Tongliang Liu,Bo Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的因果推理能力，发现其仅能进行浅层（level-1）推理，缺乏人类深层（level-2）推理能力。通过新基准CausalProbe-2024验证了这一点，并提出G^2-Reasoner方法以提升LLMs的因果推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否具备类似人类的真实因果推理能力，发现其仅能进行浅层推理，缺乏深层能力，从而提出改进方法。

Method: 通过分析LLMs的自回归机制，设计新基准CausalProbe-2024测试其推理能力，并提出G^2-Reasoner方法，结合通用知识和目标导向提示。

Result: LLMs在CausalProbe-2024上表现显著下降，验证其仅能进行level-1推理；G^2-Reasoner显著提升了其在新鲜和反事实语境中的推理能力。

Conclusion: LLMs当前仅具备浅层因果推理能力，G^2-Reasoner为迈向深层推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

### [6] [World-aware Planning Narratives Enhance Large Vision-Language Model Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21230)
*Junhao Shi,Zhaoye Fei,Siyin Wang,Qipeng Guo,Jingjing Gong,Xipeng QIu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WAP框架通过四种认知能力增强LVLMs的环境理解能力，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs在复杂场景中表现不佳，缺乏环境上下文理解，依赖额外提示而非视觉推理。

Method: 提出WAP框架，结合视觉外观建模、空间推理、功能抽象和语法基础，通过课程学习训练模型。

Result: 在EB-ALFRED基准测试中，任务成功率显著提升（60.7），尤其在常识推理（+60.0）和长时规划（+70.0）方面。

Conclusion: WAP框架显著提升了LVLMs在复杂任务中的表现，优于现有专有系统。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks
but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and
multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon
interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative
Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual
observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED
benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a
60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense
reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced
open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

*Pauline Speckmann,Mario Nadj,Christian Janiesch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IXAII是一个交互式可解释AI系统，整合了LIME、SHAP、Anchors和DiCE四种方法，提供定制化解释视图，并通过用户测试验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI方法多为静态且忽略用户视角，限制了其实际效果。

Method: 开发IXAII系统，整合四种可解释AI方法，提供交互式解释和多种可视化选项。

Result: 专家和普通用户认为IXAII能有效提升透明度。

Conclusion: IXAII为AI解释实践和人机交互提供了新视角。

Abstract: Although several post-hoc methods for explainable AI have been developed,
most are static and neglect the user perspective, limiting their effectiveness
for the target audience. In response, we developed the interactive explainable
intelligent system called IXAII that offers explanations from four explainable
AI methods: LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE. Our prototype provides tailored
views for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations'
content and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts
and lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different
explanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to
increase transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods,
interactivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on
AI explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

### [8] [Active Inference AI Systems for Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21329)
*Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出AI驱动的科学发现需解决抽象、推理和现实三大差距，而非依赖模型规模或数据。提出主动推理AI系统架构，强调因果建模、闭环验证及人机协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在科学发现中存在局限性，如架构僵化、推理脆弱及脱离实验现实。需解决抽象、推理和现实差距以推动进步。

Method: 提出主动推理AI系统，包括因果自监督基础模型、贝叶斯防护的符号/神经符号规划器、持久知识图谱及闭环验证。

Result: 架构支持反事实推理与外部验证的结合，强调人机协作在科学发现中的必要性。

Conclusion: 科学发现需结合内部模型与外部验证，人类判断是不可或缺的永久组成部分。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

### [9] [TableMoE: Neuro-Symbolic Routing for Structured Expert Reasoning in Multimodal Table Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21393)
*Junwen Zhang,Pu Chen,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TableMoE提出了一种神经符号混合专家架构，用于多模态表格数据的鲁棒结构化推理，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多模态大语言模型在复杂表格结构（如模糊、倾斜、嵌套布局等）下性能不足的问题。

Method: 采用神经符号路由机制，动态分配表格元素到专家模块（如Table-to-HTML），并引入大规模对齐数据集TableMoE-Align。

Result: 实验表明TableMoE在四个WildStruct基准测试中显著优于现有模型，验证了神经符号路由和专家对齐的重要性。

Conclusion: TableMoE通过神经符号推理提升了多模态表格理解的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due
to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,
skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or
hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited
performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture
specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table
data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which
predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)
and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,
Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed
by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven
pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of
1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and
industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate
and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,
WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models
under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental
results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core
component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and
structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase
TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the
effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table
understanding.

TL;DR: MindCube基准测试揭示现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在构建空间心理模型方面的不足，提出“先映射后推理”方法显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs是否能像人类一样从少量视角构建完整场景的空间心理模型，以解决布局、视角和动态推理问题。

Method: 使用MindCube基准测试评估VLMs的空间心理模型能力，并提出三种方法（生成中间视图、自然语言推理链、认知地图），最终采用“先映射后推理”的协同方法。

Result: 通过“先映射后推理”方法，准确率从37.8%提升至60.8%，结合强化学习后进一步提升至70.7%。

Conclusion: 构建和利用结构化空间表征的灵活推理过程，显著提升VLMs对不可见空间的理解能力。

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2)以解决人类评估成本高且难以复现的问题，通过开发人类代理代理作为评估伙伴，并开源有限的人类游戏数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI代理与人类无缝协调的开放挑战，特别是在Hanabi游戏中，克服人类评估的高成本和难以复现的局限性。

Method: 开发人类代理代理作为评估伙伴，开源3,079场游戏数据集，提供两玩家和三玩家Hanabi场景的基线结果。

Result: 提出了AH2AC2挑战和人类代理代理，为人类-AI协调提供了廉价、可复现的评估方法。

Conclusion: AH2AC2和人类代理代理为人类-AI协调研究提供了实用工具，促进了数据高效方法的发展。

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for
real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is
a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained
communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it
an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI
interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this
work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to
overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human
evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human
dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation
partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we
open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of
available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and
three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy
agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them
publicly. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法适应代理搜索的复杂性和开放性，需要新的基准和方法。

Method: 构建了130个真实任务，提出基于树状评分设计的Agent-as-a-Judge框架。

Result: OpenAI Deep Research系统达到人类性能的50-70%，时间减半。

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2为下一代代理搜索系统的开发和评估提供了基础。

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2
provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

TL;DR: PsyLite是一个基于InternLM2.5-7B-chat的轻量级心理咨询大语言模型，通过两阶段训练策略提升推理能力、咨询能力和对话安全性，并在资源受限环境中实现高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI心理咨询模型在对话安全、场景处理及轻量化部署方面存在不足，PsyLite旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用混合蒸馏数据微调和ORPO偏好优化的两阶段训练策略，结合条件RAG引入幽默元素并拒绝危险请求。

Result: 在CEval、CPsyCounE和SafeDialBench评估中表现优异，心理咨询专业性提升47.6%，对话安全性提升2.4%，且仅需5GB内存。

Conclusion: PsyLite为资源受限环境下的心理咨询应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological
counseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of
mental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue
safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address
these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological
counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model
InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation
data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the
model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe
dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom
workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed
to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological
counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to
strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the
baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological
counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation
(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism
(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score
improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology
(GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient
for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling
applications in resource-constrained environments.

Method: 通过表格生成贝叶斯网络，将自然语言查询转换为概率查询，并利用LLM生成最终答案。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法显著优于基线，证明了混合符号-神经推理的优势。

Conclusion: 混合符号-神经推理框架在概率性QA任务中表现优异，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as
NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly
retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions
requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new
benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data.
Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language
queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements
over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

### [15] [Multi-lingual Functional Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20793)
*Victor Ojewale,Inioluwa Deborah Raji,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过创建多语言功能基准（CL-GSM Symbolic和CL-IFEval），评估大语言模型在多语言环境中的实际性能和鲁棒性，发现静态基准与功能基准之间存在显著性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态多语言基准（如Belebele、M-MMLU和M-GSM）无法充分评估模型在多语言环境中的实际性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过将现有功能基准模板从英语翻译为五种语言（法语、西班牙语、印地语、阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语），创建多语言功能基准CL-GSM Symbolic和CL-IFEval。

Result: 静态基准与功能基准之间存在显著性能差异（如M-GSM与CL-GSM Symbolic在英语、法语和西班牙语中性能下降24%、17%和18%）。某些语言（如阿拉伯语、英语）在多轮评估中表现最稳定。

Conclusion: 功能基准能更准确地评估模型在多语言环境中的实际性能，且模型在不同语言中的鲁棒性差异显著。

Abstract: Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via
static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these
evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical
performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In
response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade
School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following
Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from
English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available
for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that
some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more
closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease
in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish
respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages
between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between
M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across
languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English)
being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

*Chenglei Si,Tatsunori Hashimoto,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，虽然LLM生成的研究想法在初始阶段被认为更具新颖性，但实际执行后，其评分显著下降，甚至低于人类专家的想法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI生成的研究想法是否能在实际执行中产生更好的研究结果。

Method: 招募43位专家研究人员，随机分配执行LLM生成或人类专家提出的研究想法，并撰写4页短论文，最后由NLP专家盲审评分。

Result: 执行后，LLM生成的想法在所有评估指标（新颖性、兴奋度、有效性和整体评分）上评分显著下降，甚至出现人类想法评分反超的情况。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在生成真正有效的研究想法方面存在局限性，且研究想法的评估需结合执行结果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the
scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability
to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in
which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert
ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should
also result in better research after being executed. To test whether
AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution
study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,
either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100
hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the
experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP
researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after
execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more
than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,
effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human
ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review
scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is
a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This
ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating
truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas
in the absence of execution outcomes.

*Chinmay Gondhalekar,Urjitkumar Patel,Fang-Chun Yeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiFinRAG是一个专为金融QA设计的检索增强生成框架，通过多模态提取和动态检索策略，显著提升了复杂金融文档问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM和RAG在处理多模态金融文档时存在token限制、布局丢失和跨模态上下文碎片化的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: MultiFinRAG通过轻量级多模态LLM提取表格和图像的结构化JSON和文本摘要，结合模态感知相似性阈值进行检索，并采用分层回退策略动态调整上下文。

Result: 在涉及文本、表格、图像和跨模态推理的复杂金融QA任务中，MultiFinRAG比ChatGPT-4o（免费版）准确率高出19个百分点。

Conclusion: MultiFinRAG在有限硬件条件下实现了高效的多模态金融文档问答，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span
hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative
text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such
content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains
traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented
cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation
framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal
extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to
a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both
structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along
with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity
thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically
escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling
cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on
commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy
than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text,
tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在检测和应对暴力内容时的能力，尤其是在道德模糊的真实场景中。

Method: 使用VBVQ问卷评估LLMs，并引入基于身份的提示来评估潜在偏见。

Result: LLMs的暴力倾向与表面文本不一致，且在不同人口统计学特征中存在偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs在暴力内容处理中存在局限性，需进一步研究其道德推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and
responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally
ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first
study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to
measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior
Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce
persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within
the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and
organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our
study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often
diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their
violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting
established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

<details>

Motivation: 由于医学决策的高风险性和医学文献的复杂性，公众对医学事实核查系统的需求增加，但现有系统未能满足实际需求。

Method: 通过研究临床专家如何验证社交媒体上的真实医学声明，揭示医学事实核查中的核心挑战。

Result: 发现医学事实核查面临证据连接困难、声明模糊性及主观性等问题。

Conclusion: 建议将医学事实核查视为交互式沟通问题，而非端到端过程。

Abstract: Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were
regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting
these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes
nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and
diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every
individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical
literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such
problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end
fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and
return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely
unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical
experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.
In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in
end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting
claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials;
ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and
inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be
approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than
an end-to-end process.

Motivation: 语言模型在NLP中表现出色，但适应特定任务时存在效率低、易过拟合和计算成本高的问题，限制了其在实际任务中的应用。

Result: 这些方法显著提升了语言模型的鲁棒性、效率和泛化能力，使其更适应多样化任务。

Conclusion: 这些进展是迈向更鲁棒和高效语言模型的重要一步，推动了通用人工智能的发展。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet
adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging.
As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often
underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small
task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These
limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world
language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream
applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant
knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training
technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,
we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces
memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also
introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better
follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their
performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.
Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop
spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more
comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results
demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,
efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of
applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and
efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general
intelligence.

Result: 新管道构建的数据集性能优于现有数据集，并提出了基于重复计数和质量的数据集平衡方法。

Conclusion: 成功构建了FineWeb2多语言数据集（20TB，50亿文档），并开源了相关代码和工具。

Abstract: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and
evaluation codebases.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact
embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text
embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key
innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation
learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional
transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length
embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on
large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on
high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup
parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a
focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult
samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard
negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories
of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost
both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive
evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English
show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and
competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new
standard for a versatile and compact embedding model with less than 1B
parameters.

Motivation: 探讨如何通过梯度更新模拟提示的效果，以弥补传统微调在泛化和逻辑推理上的不足。

Method: 使用基于梯度的元学习方法，以语言模型自身的提示预测为目标，无需真实标签。

Result: 实验表明，梯度下降训练能部分或完全恢复提示模型的性能，在特定任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: 结果表明，适当的初始化下梯度下降具有强大的表达能力，为长上下文建模和梯度学习泛化能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide
range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them
to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this
expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM
personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models
face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which
only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for
controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending
the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five
model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing
expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured
framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and
dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces
adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and
leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:
\textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and
\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity
as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable
personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe
that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related
traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize
multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in
isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine
interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing
processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models
effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains
uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context,
this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets
derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced
CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1
405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated
using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and
legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal
interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis
and accurate legal interpretation.

Motivation: 电商查询通常短且缺乏上下文，现有方法依赖用户点击行为，导致马太效应，且缺乏统一框架，效率低下。

Method: SSUF框架包含知识增强、标签增强和结构增强模块，模块可插拔，适应不同子任务需求。

Result: 离线和在线A/B实验表明，SSUF显著优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: SSUF通过统一框架和增强模块有效解决了电商查询分类中的问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category
prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually
short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used,
resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing
industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior
to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle.
Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework,
leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework
(SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification
tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query
representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The
label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to
reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module
enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each
module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as
needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B
experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

Motivation: 传统立场检测研究局限于单实例分析，缺乏真实社交互动的数据集，限制了多轮对话立场检测的发展。

Method: 引入MT2-CSD数据集，提出LLM-CRAN模型，利用大语言模型的推理能力提升对话理解。

Result: LLM-CRAN在MT2-CSD数据集上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: MT2-CSD和LLM-CRAN为多轮对话立场检测提供了新工具和基准。

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is
pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on
contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional
stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting
its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media
scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that
authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering
advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce
MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational
stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset
available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and
exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges
for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large
Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),
which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational
understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of
LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that
LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of
conversational stance detection.

TL;DR: DALR方法通过双重对齐学习解决跨模态偏差和模态内语义分歧问题，提升句子表示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像和文本对齐上较粗粒度，存在跨模态偏差和模态内语义分歧问题，影响句子表示质量。

Method: 提出DALR方法，包括跨模态一致性学习模块（软化负样本并利用辅助任务语义相似性）和模态内排序蒸馏与全局对齐学习。

Result: 在语义文本相似性（STS）和迁移（TR）任务上表现优异，超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DALR通过双重对齐学习有效提升多模态句子表示质量，实验验证其优越性。

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art
baselines.

Motivation: 社区问答平台是重要的知识库，但现有方法未能充分利用外部知识或动态历史上下文，且缺乏适合工业部署的记忆机制。

Method: 提出ComRAG框架，结合静态知识和动态历史问答对，采用基于质心的记忆机制进行检索、生成和高效存储。

Result: 在三个工业CQA数据集上，ComRAG在向量相似度上提升25.9%，延迟降低8.7%至23.3%，存储块增长从20.23%降至2.06%。

Conclusion: ComRAG通过整合静态与动态知识，显著提升了工业CQA的性能和效率。

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for
retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA
datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9%
improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and
lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

TL;DR: Progtuning是一种结合渐进式学习的微调框架，通过逐步减少更新的Transformer块数量，优化资源分配并减少约25%的更新参数，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型规模增大，全参数微调成本高昂，现有参数高效微调方法未考虑Transformer块贡献不均的问题，导致资源分配低效。

Method: 提出Progtuning框架，基于贡献逐步减少更新的Transformer块数量。

Result: 减少约25%的更新参数，保持竞争性能，且与参数高效微调方法兼容。

Conclusion: Progtuning显著优化资源分配，适应性强，适用于多种微调场景。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based
language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating
all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a
small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of
parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across
Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing
resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning
framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language
models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated
transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes
resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by
approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it
also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,
demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型在文本生成中存在速度慢和全局一致性差的问题，扩散模型提供了一种并行生成和灵活控制的替代方案。

Method: Cosmos通过训练一个同时进行token级重建和与预训练语言编码器对齐的自编码器，学习压缩的潜在空间，用于扩散生成。

Result: Cosmos在保持生成质量的同时，压缩了8倍的文本表示，并在某些任务中超越了扩散和自回归基线，推理速度快2倍以上。

Conclusion: Cosmos展示了在压缩潜在空间中应用扩散模型的潜力，为高效、高质量的文本生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their
sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and
maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a
promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;
however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high
dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel
approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth
latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using
an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and
alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing
robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based
augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be
compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to
token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence
length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive
baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story
generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare
it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior
generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

Motivation: 改进对话系统和机器人中的轮换预测，使其能通过文本指令动态调整。

Result: 模型提高了预测准确性，并能根据文本提示动态调整轮换时机。

Conclusion: 该模型为对话系统提供了直观且动态的轮换控制方法。

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索的提示策略，利用句法相似性而非语义相似性选择示例，用于自动术语提取（ATE），在少样本设置中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在自动术语提取（ATE）中的潜力尚未充分探索，现有方法多依赖语义相似性，而句法相似性可能更有效。

Method: 采用基于检索的提示策略，通过句法相似性选择示例，适用于少样本设置，且与领域无关。

Result: 在三个专业ATE基准测试中，句法检索方法提高了F1分数，尤其在查询句子与检索示例间词汇重叠时表现更优。

Conclusion: 句法线索在LLM适应术语提取任务中具有重要性，为ATE任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that
are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information
retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We
propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting,
selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic
similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides
more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap
between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance.
Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval
improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues
when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏外部反馈，多模态代理在自我纠正和泛化方面表现不佳，需要专门的奖励模型评估基准。

Method: 设计了Agent-RewardBench，包含多维度评估、步骤级奖励评估和高质量数据采样。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的多模态模型在奖励建模方面表现有限，需专门训练。

Conclusion: Agent-RewardBench为代理奖励建模提供了有效评估工具，推动了相关研究的发展。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show
promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence.
However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents
struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to
use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select
reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench
targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The
benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and
real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and
safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the
assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a
more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)
Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse
models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification
to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the
need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at
github.

TL;DR: 研究表明，尽管大型语言模型（LLM）能生成逼真的“假文本”，但简单的分类器仍能以较低资源实现较高检测准确率。实验发现，某些模型（如Gemini）在生成欺骗性文本方面有所提升，但GPT未表现出类似趋势，暗示未来检测仍可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型生成“假文本”的能力是否会随着模型规模的扩大而无限提升，以及检测方法是否能持续有效。

Method: 通过统计分类器检测经典侦探小说风格的“假文本”，并比较不同模型（如Gemini和GPT）的欺骗性文本生成能力。

Result: Gemini在0.5版本更新后生成欺骗性文本的能力增强，而GPT未表现出类似趋势。

Conclusion: 尽管模型规模不断扩大，但可靠检测“假文本”仍可能实现，但新模型架构可能提升欺骗性。

Abstract: Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as
academic writing, product reviews, and political news. Many approaches have
been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this
may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever
more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers
demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To
approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may
therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to
identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5
version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate
deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of
fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model
architectures may improve their deceptiveness

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢思考大语言模型（LLMs）在生成批判性反馈和优化解决方案方面能力有限，需要一种方法增强其推理能力。

Method: 提出Double-Checker框架，通过1,730个自我批判实例的微调，使LLMs在推理过程中迭代批判和优化输出。

Result: Double-Checker将AIME基准测试的pass@1性能从4.4%提升至18.2%。

Conclusion: Double-Checker为开发更具信任感和高效自我批判能力的LLMs提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like
reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate
informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this
paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit
self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By
fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker
empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during
inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated
critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive
suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique
significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably,
our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME
benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These
results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and
effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级模型，用于检测查询是否基于上下文文档，以减少LLMs的推理时间和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在上下文信息不足时容易产生不可靠的回答，因此需要一种机制来确保回答的基于性（groundedness）。

Method: 使用轻量级编码器模型（如RoBERTa和NomicBERT）在精选数据集上进行微调，以检测查询是否基于上下文。

Result: 这些轻量级模型在基于性检测上的准确性与最先进的LLMs（如Llama3 8B和GPT4o）相当，同时显著降低了推理延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少LLMs的推理成本，同时确保回答的基于性和可信度。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

Motivation: 探索语言上下文是否能独立支持视觉对话中指代表达式的检测，减少对视觉信息的依赖。

Method: 采用预训练的大型语言模型（LLM），通过下一词预测标注对话中的指代表达式边界。

Result: 即使使用中等规模LLM和小数据集，仅文本方法也有效，表明语言上下文的重要性。

Conclusion: 任务本质是多模态的，单模态方法存在根本限制。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language
modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually
grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to
which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that
have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the
conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to
perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding
conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token
prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM,
relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only
approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the
linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task
represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental
to unimodal approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding and generating text but

we propose quantitative metrics for GSS-based literary criticism using the
LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our framework's results, compared with expert
criticism across multiple works and LLMs, show high performance. Finally, we
applied GLASS to 39 classic works, producing original and high-quality analyses
that address existing research gaps. This research provides an AI-based tool
for literary research and education, offering insights into the cognitive

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的RAG系统在处理噪声、模糊和多意图查询时表现不佳，现有系统通常基于干净数据训练或评估，无法满足实际需求。

Method: Omni-RAG采用三个模块：深度查询理解与分解、意图感知知识检索、重排序与生成，利用LLM和特定技术（如OpenSearch、BGE、Falcon-10B）处理查询。

Result: Omni-RAG能够有效处理复杂和噪声查询，提升RAG系统在实时开放域环境中的表现。

Conclusion: Omni-RAG填补了当前RAG能力与实际应用需求之间的差距，适用于如SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG挑战等场景。

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and
contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with
external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex
inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper
introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and
effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs
LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key
modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs
with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and
decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus
(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking
and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before
a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a
chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG
capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those
highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex
and noisy queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态平台上语言模式的演化和概念漂移（CD）使得检测欺骗性对话变得困难，现有LLM在风险敏感场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出DK-Enhanced LLM框架，包含三个模块：DK-LLM检测欺骗对话、OCDD检测语义漂移、另一个DK-LLM分类漂移性质。

Result: 在SEConvo数据集上，系统检测欺骗对话准确率达98%，显著优于零样本基线。

Conclusion: 结合领域知识和漂移检测显著提升了高风险NLP应用的性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly
difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)-i.e.,
semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions
over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,
making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with
contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios. To address
these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework
that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to
perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists
of three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive
conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a
semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the
drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain
knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to
SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and
spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake conversations with high
accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift. Guided by structured
prompts, the LLaMA-based implementation achieves 98% classification accuracy.
Comparative studies against zero-shot baselines demonstrate that incorporating
domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance,
interpretability, and robustness in high-stakes NLP applications.

Conclusion: 研究强调了多语言查询生成中更包容性评估和开发的必要性，未来工作包括模式本地化和多语言微调。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled natural language
interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as
Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database
accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited
evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of
foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create
and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into
Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair
cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using
standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance
pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute
this to differences in training data availability and linguistic
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task
prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in
evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our
findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in
multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and
fine-tuning across diverse languages.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的偏好对齐框架，用于通过用户交互改进实时对话的语音对话模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法主要针对文本语言模型，不适用于实时语音交互的复杂性（如打断、插话等）。

Method: 构建了一个包含15万对偏好标注的大规模数据集，利用离线对齐方法微调全双工自回归语音到语音模型。

Result: 实验表明，通用对话的反馈能有效改进语音对话模型，使其更准确、更安全且更符合上下文。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在实时语音对话系统中平衡多种动态的重要性。

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken
dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current
preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and
are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions,
with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit
segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than
150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated
with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and
temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune
a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently
effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer
and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and
conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn
conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated
balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Transformer架构，通过引入TopK激活函数，解决了稀疏自编码器（SAE）在解释语言模型时的局限性，提高了模型的稳定性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器（SAE）在分析Transformer语言模型的激活空间时存在局限性，如训练后特征不稳定、难以比较不同检查点的特征等。

Method: 在Transformer架构中引入TopK激活函数，使隐藏状态直接等效于TopK SAE的潜在特征，无需后训练。

Result: TopK语言模型在保持原始性能的同时，提供了稳定的稀疏表示，支持神经元干预和跨检查点分析。

Conclusion: TopK语言模型为语言模型的学习和概念表示提供了稳定可靠的工具，推动了模型可解释性和可控性的研究。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and
interpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs).
However, SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and
internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the
failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due
to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated
by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE
learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of
feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across
different checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a
modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK
activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states
equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the
need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.
The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,
computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple
architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while
providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that
the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering
through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of
neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make
TopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn
and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future
research on model interpretability and controllability.

Motivation: 探索不同在线模式（离线、半在线、完全在线）在可验证和不可验证任务中对强化学习微调大语言模型的影响。

Method: 比较了在线和半在线直接偏好优化与组奖励策略优化目标，并分析了训练动态和超参数选择策略。

Result: 在线和半在线方法表现相似且优于离线方法，多任务联合训练可提升性能。

Conclusion: 在线和半在线强化学习方法在微调大语言模型中表现优异，多任务联合训练进一步优化性能。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for
finetuning large language models when transitioning from offline to semi-online
to fully online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. Our
experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable
instruction following with a set of benchmark evaluations for both. Across
these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference
Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly
find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all
strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the
training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal
results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable
rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过未来对话信号优化交互式LLM以提升用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在社交对话中未能直接保证用户参与度，需更直接的指标。

Method: 利用用户反应作为奖励信号，通过i×MCTS模拟交互并收集数据，采用DPO对齐模型。

Result: 在情感支持和说服对话中，方法显著提升用户参与度。

Conclusion: 直接优化用户反应可有效提升交互式LLM的社交对话参与度。

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in
socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason
over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between
user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee
user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable
interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future
development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant
indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue
intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To
achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive
LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system
via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree
\textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset
containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using
\textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user
engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments
conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support
conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively
enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑LLM在基准测试中的表现是否真实反映其理解能力，而非仅表面上的答案匹配。

Method: 提出两种量化方法：一种基于专门设计的基准测试，另一种提供普遍性的下限估计。

Result: 发现Potemkin理解在模型、任务和领域中普遍存在，且反映了概念表征的内部不一致性。

Conclusion: 基准测试的有效性依赖于LLM的错误模式是否与人类相似，否则可能仅体现虚假理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark
datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities
based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces
a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the
benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test
people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid
tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human
misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin
understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable
with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for
quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed
benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a
lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across
models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just
incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept
representations.

Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language
models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of
these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter
large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated

HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs
when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user
interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals
insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as
common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and
interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring
the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs
deployed as conversational AI. Code and artifacts to retrieve our analyses and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注数据效率（Data Efficiency），而数据效能（Data Efficacy）作为优化数据组织的方式尚未充分探索，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出DELT范式，包含数据评分（如LQS）、数据选择和数据排序（如FO），通过梯度一致性评估数据样本的学习性和质量。

Result: 实验表明DELT能不同程度提升模型性能，LQS与FO组合效果最佳，且数据效能与数据效率可同时实现。

Conclusion: 数据效能是语言模型训练中具有潜力的基础研究方向。

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTSurv是一种基于最优传输的多实例学习框架，用于全切片图像的生存预测，通过全局和局部约束建模病理异质性，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法未能明确捕捉全切片图像中的病理异质性，包括全局的长尾形态分布和局部的瓦片级预测不确定性。

Method: OTSurv将生存预测建模为带有全局长尾约束和局部不确定性约束的最优传输问题，并通过不平衡OT公式高效求解。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，OTSurv的平均C-index绝对提升了3.6%，并在对数秩检验中达到统计显著性。

Conclusion: OTSurv是一种高效且可解释的生存预测工具，适用于数字病理学。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: StereoDiff结合立体匹配和视频深度扩散，通过两阶段方法提升视频深度估计的一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频深度估计并非图像深度估计的简单扩展，静态和动态区域的时序一致性需求不同。静态区域可通过立体匹配获得全局3D线索，而动态区域需依赖大规模视频数据学习平滑过渡。

Method: 提出StereoDiff，分两阶段：立体匹配处理静态区域，视频深度扩散处理动态区域。通过频域分析证明二者的互补性。

Result: 在零样本、真实世界动态视频深度基准测试中，StereoDiff表现最优，一致性和准确性显著提升。

Conclusion: StereoDiff通过结合立体匹配和视频深度扩散，有效解决了视频深度估计中的静态和动态区域一致性问题，实现了SoTA性能。

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

Motivation: 视觉和触觉是机器人感知和操作任务中的关键模态，但现有方法在模态融合时特征整合效果不佳。

Method: 提出ConViTac网络，利用对比编码器预训练和跨模态注意力机制，实现视觉和触觉输入的联合嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，ConViTac在材料分类和抓取预测任务中准确率提升高达12.0%。

Conclusion: ConViTac通过对比嵌入条件机制有效提升了视觉-触觉特征融合的性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

Motivation: 当前缺乏对不同提示质量下医学图像分割模型的统一评估与比较，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用SAM、SAM 2、MedSAM、SAM-Med-3D和nnU-Net在BraTS 2023数据集上进行零样本推理，并比较不同提示质量（点和边界框）下的性能。

Result: SAM和SAM 2在精确边界框提示下Dice分数高达0.894和0.893，优于nnU-Net，但nnU-Net仍是最实用的选择。

Conclusion: 尽管某些模型在特定条件下表现优异，nnU-Net仍是医学图像分割的主导方法，未来可通过微调进一步优化提示性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

Motivation: 在嘈杂环境中，手势是非人机交互的重要方式。传统深度学习依赖任务专用架构，而VFMs和VLMs的泛化能力可能降低系统复杂度。

Method: 比较V-JEPA（VFM）、Gemini Flash 2.0（VLM）和HD-GCN（骨架方法）在NUGGET数据集上的表现，探讨其适用性。

Result: HD-GCN表现最佳，V-JEPA接近且简化了系统设计；Gemini在零样本设置下表现不佳。

Conclusion: V-JEPA有望作为共享多任务模型简化系统，但需进一步研究手势的输入表示方式。

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超分辨率（SR）问题存在多个可行解，现有方法在平衡保真度和感知质量时容易引入伪影，而扩散模型生成的多样解难以选择最可信的样本。

Method: 利用VLM（如BLIP-2、GPT-4o）通过结构化查询评估语义正确性、视觉质量和伪影存在，并设计TWS评分（结合CLIP嵌入、SSIM和小波分解）量化可信度。

Result: 实验表明，TWS与人类偏好高度相关，且VLM引导的选择能持续获得高TWS值，优于传统指标（如PSNR、LPIPS）。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩散SR空间的不确定性提供了可扩展、通用的解决方案，为生成SR的可信度设定了新标准。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

*Ha Min Son,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FixCLR是一种新的半监督域泛化方法，通过对比学习显式正则化域不变表示，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督域泛化中标签稀缺导致的性能不足问题，现有方法未显式正则化域不变表示。

Method: 引入FixCLR，利用伪标签的类别信息和排斥项，适应对比学习以实现域不变正则化。

Result: FixCLR有效提升性能，尤其在与其他半监督方法结合时表现更佳。

Conclusion: FixCLR是一种有效的SSDG方法，适用于多领域数据集，并能与其他方法互补。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance
of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many
domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when
combined with other semi-supervised methods.

### [60] [Vector Contrastive Learning For Pixel-Wise Pretraining In Medical Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20850)
*Yuting He,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的对比学习方法（COVER），通过向量回归问题重新定义对比学习，解决了像素级表示中的过分散问题，提升了医学视觉基础模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比学习（CL）在自监督预训练（SSP）中表现优异，但在像素级表示中存在过分散问题，破坏了像素级特征相关性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出向量对比学习（vector CL），将CL重新定义为向量回归问题，并设计了COVER框架，通过向量金字塔架构实现粒度适应，保持像素级特征相关性。

Result: 在8个任务、2个维度和4种模态的实验中，COVER显著提升了像素级SSP性能，推动了通用医学视觉基础模型的发展。

Conclusion: COVER通过向量回归和距离建模，有效解决了像素级表示中的过分散问题，为医学视觉基础模型提供了更优的自监督预训练方法。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MIDAS的数据增强方法，用于提升动态面部表情识别（DFER）在模糊表情数据上的性能，通过软标签和视频帧的凸组合实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态面部表情识别中模糊表情的准确识别问题，尤其是在真实场景数据中。

Method: 提出MIDAS方法，通过软标签和视频帧的凸组合进行数据增强，扩展了mixup方法到视频数据。

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k-Plus数据集上的实验表明，MIDAS显著提升了性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MIDAS是一种简单高效的数据增强方法，能有效处理DFER中的模糊表情问题。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

*Calin Teodor Ioan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThirdEye是一种基于显式单目线索的深度估计方法，通过预训练网络提供线索，并结合记忆模块和自适应变换器生成高分辨率视差图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度估计方法忽略了人类视觉系统依赖的显式单目线索（如遮挡边界、阴影和透视），ThirdEye旨在通过显式提供这些线索改进深度估计。

Method: 使用预训练且冻结的专家网络提供单目线索，通过三阶段皮层层次结构（V1->V2->V3）和记忆模块融合线索，最后用自适应变换器生成视差图。

Result: ThirdEye继承了外部监督的优势，仅需少量微调，但具体量化结果将在未来版本中公布。

Conclusion: ThirdEye通过显式利用单目线索，提供了一种更高效的深度估计方法，未来将进一步完善实验和结果。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

Abstract: This work investigates the geometric foundations of modern stereo vision

attention mechanisms in recovering meaningful 3D surfaces. Through both
theoretical insights and empirical studies on real datasets, we demonstrate
that combining strong geometric priors with learned features provides internal
abstractions for understanding stereo vision systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮图像编辑任务中高成本和低效率的问题，通过结合LLMs的快速规划和A$^*$搜索的精确性。

Method: 结合LLMs的高层规划和A$^*$搜索的低层工具调用，通过归纳推理提取可重用子程序，实现自适应快慢规划。

Result: FaSTA$^*$在计算效率上显著优于现有方法，同时保持与最先进基线相当的成功率。

Conclusion: FaSTA$^*$通过快慢规划结合和子程序重用，高效解决了复杂图像编辑任务。

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在像素级伪造定位中存在计算开销大和表示能力有限的问题，尤其是对细微或复杂篡改的处理不足。

Method: M2SFormer在跳跃连接中统一多频率和多尺度注意力，并利用全局先验图指导难度感知注意力模块，以保留细微篡改细节。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，M2SFormer优于现有最先进模型，并在未见领域表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: M2SFormer通过结合全局上下文和难度感知机制，显著提升了伪造检测和定位的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations
more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models,
offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across
unseen domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LBS方法在模拟弹性材料（如软组织、毛发等）时存在不足，导致体积损失和不自然变形。

Method: PhysRig将刚性骨骼嵌入体积表示（如四面体网格），并作为可变形软体结构模拟，利用连续介质力学和粒子离散化确保可微分性。

Result: PhysRig在合成数据集上表现优于传统LBS方法，生成更真实和物理合理的结果。

Conclusion: PhysRig为关节物体建模提供了一种更通用和物理准确的方法。

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object
categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional
LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the
pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object
modeling.

Conclusion: HST-CSLR通过结合文本知识和视觉表示学习，显著提升了连续手语识别的性能。

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

Conclusion: PathChat+和SlideSeek系统为病理学提供了强大的多模态和自主诊断工具。

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language

insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as

Result: DFVEdit在推理速度上提升至少20倍，内存减少85%，并在结构保真度、时空一致性和编辑质量上达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: DFVEdit为Video DiTs提供了一种高效、高质量的零样本视频编辑解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

Conclusion: Cradle2Cane通过两阶段设计有效解决了年龄与身份的权衡问题，为计算机视觉中的人脸老化任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the

experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in
age accuracy and identity consistency.

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer
vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions
in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without
accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently
incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the
quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By
introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full
photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on
simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the
proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D
scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric
parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene
representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the
camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a
complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera
photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of
imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SP-Ctrl的新方法，利用稀疏信号（如OpenPose）进行姿态引导的图像生成，解决了密集信号带来的编辑困难和文本不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集信号（如深度、DensePose）在姿态引导的图像生成中存在编辑困难和与文本提示不一致的问题，因此重新探索稀疏信号的潜力。

Method: 扩展OpenPose为可学习的空间表示，并引入关键点概念学习，提升关键点嵌入的表达能力和姿态对齐。

Result: 在动物和人类图像生成任务中，SP-Ctrl优于其他稀疏姿态引导方法，甚至媲美密集信号方法，并展示了跨物种生成的潜力。

Conclusion: 稀疏信号在姿态引导的图像生成中具有潜力，SP-Ctrl通过改进稀疏信号的表现力和控制能力，取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

TL;DR: 论文提出EVA框架，通过多专家域适应和语义变体对齐，提升组合零样本学习（CZSL）的性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CZSL方法通过简单的组合-原型映射提取特征，忽略了语义子集和组合差异，导致图像-组合对齐不精细。

Method: 提出EVA框架，采用多专家域适应实现令牌感知学习，并通过语义变体对齐选择语义相关表示。

Result: 在三个流行基准测试中，EVA在封闭和开放世界设置下均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EVA通过多专家和语义对齐机制，有效提升了CZSL的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional
generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on
learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives
features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

Conclusion: 该工作推动了精准肿瘤学中可解释AI的发展。

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for
analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to
limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these
limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation
foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce
PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology
segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label
triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform
semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for
laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher
accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture.
It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145
and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in
segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover,
PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models
through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering
pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work
advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.

Conclusion: TSDASeg通过直接跨模态对齐和动态内存模块，有效解决了交互式分割中的不一致性问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能为单一视频生成多个语义不同的音频轨道，合成质量优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在视频到音频生成中表现出色，为高质量合成音频提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that
sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific
sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows,
aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,
conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This
design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional
generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a
training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and
eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more
accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading
to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

Conclusion: DBMovi-GS方法有效解决了动态模糊场景的新视角合成问题，提升了视觉保真度。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic
motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view
synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic
novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

Conclusion: SAIC在临床应用场景中具有普适性和实用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical
application scenarios. Our code will be released at

Motivation: 场景文本去除（STR）技术可能被滥用，因此需要一种方法来检测和定位被移除的文本区域，以识别潜在滥用并改进STR技术。

Method: 提出逆向STR（ISTR）方法，通过分析STR处理后的图像，进行二元分类和文本区域定位，并尝试恢复被移除的文本内容。

Result: 实验表明，ISTR在二元分类和定位任务中实现了高精度，同时探索了恢复文本内容的可能性。

Conclusion: ISTR为检测STR滥用提供了有效工具，并有助于改进STR技术。

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

Conclusion: VisionGuard能有效提升头盔违规检测性能，有望在实际交通监控中推广，促进安全和法规遵守。

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the
data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and
disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively
addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that
VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in
traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory
compliance.

<details>

Motivation: 当前使用的2D标本放射成像（SR）在评估术中标本边缘状态时准确性有限，导致近四分之一的患者需要额外手术。

Method: 结合SAM和FFCL，通过预训练ResNet-18骨干网络进行边缘状态分类，并利用SAM细化肿瘤边缘分割。

Result: AUC为0.8455，Dice相似度比基线模型提高27.4%，推理时间缩短至47毫秒/图像。

Conclusion: FFCL-SAM显著提高了术中边缘评估的速度和准确性，有望降低再切除率并改善乳腺癌治疗效果。

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 将老化转化为多维、可控且可解释的过程，为数字叙事、健康教育等提供新可能。

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AR方法需要用户通过3D标注对齐AR显示来采集数据，任务繁重且限制场景范围，因此需要更自由、高效的方法。

Method: 使用局部重建的光场和可视化待消除的误差，引导用户插入新视角，减少侵入性并提高效率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在移动视角合成系统中表现优异，同时为更大场景的3D重建提供了潜在贡献。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field
reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

Conclusion: MPA-FER通过细粒度语义指导和跨模态对齐，显著提升了面部表情识别的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA方法仅提供数值评分，无法全面描述视频质量的复杂维度，限制了其应用。通过利用语言输出，视频LMMs有望解决这一问题，但缺乏高效的数据生成方法。

Method: 提出SIG流程，自动化生成视频质量指令数据，包括分数映射到文本层级和分层Chain-of-Thought（CoT）建模。构建S2I数据集和渐进式调优策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在S2I-Bench和现有基准测试中显著提升了视频LMMs的质量评分和解释能力。

Conclusion: SIG流程和S2I数据集为视频LMMs的质量评估提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the

Result: 实验证明FedSC在多种挑战性场景下有效，关键组件高效。

Conclusion: FedSC通过语义级协作成功解决了数据异构性问题，并提供了理论收敛保证。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

Result: 实验证明FGS在保持编辑能力的同时显著提升了忠实度，且适用于多种编辑任务。

Conclusion: FGS是一种有效的解决方案，能够在图像编辑中平衡编辑能力与忠实度。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory

Conclusion: LASFNet在效率和精度上取得了显著平衡，代码将开源。

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex
training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking
multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline
that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance
detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we
propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network
(LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature
fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features
at both global and local levels based on attention information from different
modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation.
Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative
datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach
achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of
parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively,
while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be

Result: 在1024x1024图像上仅需128个离散token，token数量减少32倍，训练和推理速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像生成提供了一种高效且可扩展的替代方案，无需私有数据或后训练优化。

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational
demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the
efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent
advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by
eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance
compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents.
By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using
traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution
details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our
knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive
performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128
discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold
reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary
latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked
improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models
allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X
GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve
competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any
in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

Result: 实验表明，新数据集和模型显著提升了多场景视频理解能力，并在多个视频基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MultiClip-Bench和IPFormer-VideoLLM有效解决了多镜头场景中的挑战，提升了VideoLLMs的性能。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

Motivation: 商用RGB-D相机对非朗伯物体生成的深度图通常噪声大且不完整，传统方法因训练数据有限而泛化能力差，扩散模型虽能提供视觉先验，但存在训练-推理偏差和特征不足的问题。

Method: 提出DidSee框架：1）使用重新缩放的噪声调度器消除信号泄漏偏差；2）设计噪声无关的单步训练策略减少误差累积；3）引入语义增强器联合深度补全与语义分割。

Result: DidSee在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，具有强泛化能力，并显著提升下游任务（如姿态估计和机器人抓取）的效果。

Conclusion: DidSee通过改进扩散模型框架，有效解决了非朗伯物体深度补全的挑战，为实际应用提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that
biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion
framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the
lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders
precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a
diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects.
First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal
signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a
noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation
caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion
and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding
precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and
effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation
and robotic grasping.Project page: https://wenzhoulyu.github.io/DidSee/

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant
advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data
scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to
domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights
for visual perception tasks across diverse domains. The code is available at

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential

addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data

extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute

segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an
out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various
imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable
foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

Result: 在多个LVU基准测试中表现优异，显著优于现有KV压缩方法。

Conclusion: Video-X^2L无需额外训练即可高效提升长视频理解性能，兼容现有MLLM。

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

TL;DR: SAMURAI结合CLIP语义匹配和形状引导重排，通过多数投票策略提升3D物体检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂室内环境中，仅使用掩码2D图像和自然语言描述检索3D物体存在挑战，如视角扭曲、无纹理区域和模糊语言提示。

Method: 提出SAMURAI框架，整合CLIP语义匹配和形状引导重排，结合预处理管道优化掩码质量。

Result: 在ROOMELSA测试集上表现优异，验证了形状先验与语言理解结合的重要性。

Conclusion: 形状先验与语言理解的结合对开放世界3D物体检索至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BitMark是一种针对Infinity模型的比特级水印框架，旨在防止模型崩溃，通过在多尺度嵌入水印并保持生成速度和视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像模型生成的图像在互联网上泛滥，这些图像可能被重新用作训练数据，导致模型性能逐渐退化（模型崩溃）。水印技术可以识别生成内容，从而缓解这一问题。

Method: BitMark在Infinity的图像生成过程中，直接在比特级别嵌入水印，覆盖多个分辨率，同时保持视觉质量和生成速度。

Result: BitMark的水印具有高放射性，即使生成的图像被用于训练其他模型，水印仍可被检测到。

Conclusion: BitMark为预防图像生成模型的崩溃提供了一种可靠的方法，通过水印技术有效识别生成内容。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了HalluSegBench，首个专注于通过反事实视觉推理评估视觉基础中幻觉问题的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型常产生与图像内容无关的幻觉分割，而现有评估协议无法全面诊断这些关键失败。

Method: 构建包含1340个反事实实例对的数据集，并提出新指标量化视觉场景编辑下的幻觉敏感性。

Result: 实验表明视觉驱动的幻觉比标签驱动的更普遍，模型常持续产生错误分割。

Conclusion: 反事实推理对诊断视觉基础的真实性至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced
grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit
hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the
image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing
evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or
textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their
capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce
HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual
reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual
instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly
introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually
coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art
vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations
are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often
persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual
reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

Motivation: 传统方法在姿势标准化阶段容易因自遮挡和视角问题生成失真图像，影响后续3D重建质量。

Method: 提出基于流的3D原生生成框架，利用3D骨骼作为姿势条件，并通过随机清空条件提升控制效果。

Result: 实验表明，PoseMaster在A姿势角色生成上优于现有技术，并能精确控制任意姿势。

Conclusion: PoseMaster通过统一框架和多条件训练，显著提升了3D角色生成的效率和质量。

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立体匹配在自动驾驶系统中至关重要，但现有方法在实时性和精度之间存在权衡。大规模成本体积计算复杂，小规模则信息不足。

Method: 通过ESM整合初级特征到视差上采样单元，快速提取初始视差特征并与图像特征融合，通过轻量级网络恢复细节。

Result: ESM在高端GPU上达到116 FPS，AGX Orin上91 FPS，同时保持高精度视差估计。

Conclusion: ESM有效平衡了实时性和精度，为立体匹配提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern
autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo
matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost
volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information
and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and
regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale
cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising
route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure
highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the
Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with
small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary
features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from
the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These
features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a
compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene
geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large
receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a
highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo
achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX
Orin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文作为最早的古文字之一，其未解读字符的结构复杂且抽象，解读难度大。本文旨在通过技术手段提升解读效率和准确性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段利用增强空间感知推理的多模态大语言模型分析字形结构；第二阶段引入甲骨结构向量融合技术，生成语义丰富的矢量字体。

Result: 实验表明，OracleFusion在语义、视觉吸引力和字形保持方面优于现有基准模型，显著提升了可读性和美观性。

Conclusion: OracleFusion为甲骨文解读提供了专家级见解，是推动甲骨文研究的有力工具。

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS)
encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient
civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters,
only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with
their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for
interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first
stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with
enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of
the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the
second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF),
incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to
ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This
approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering
visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of
semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both
readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides
expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for
advancing the decipherment of OBS.

TL;DR: FlickCD是一种轻量级遥感变化检测模型，通过增强差异模块和多尺度语义捕捉，在降低资源消耗的同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习模型复杂度高且计算需求大，但并未显著提升精度。研究旨在开发高效轻量模型，适用于卫星处理。

Method: 提出FlickCD模型，包含增强差异模块（EDM）和局部-全局融合块（SWSA和EGSA），以减少计算成本并捕捉多尺度变化。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，FlickCD显著降低计算和存储开销，同时达到或接近SOTA性能。

Conclusion: FlickCD在性能和资源消耗之间取得了优异平衡，适用于实时遥感变化检测。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,
disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and
large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep
learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and
computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into
significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and
storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1)
accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at

Method: 采用分层状态空间模型，结合局部聚合和全局关系模块，利用混合离散-连续监督策略训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著超越现有方法（Cholec80 +2.8%，MICCAI2016 +4.3%，Heichole +12.9%）。

Conclusion: 该方法高效处理长视频，同时捕捉局部和全局动态，性能优越。

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available
after paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像和点云特征通道注意力的差异可能导致匹配结果退化，影响配准精度；场景中的相似结构可能导致跨模态匹配中的冗余对应关系。

Method: 提出CAA模块增强模态内特征并抑制跨模态敏感性，GOS模块用全局优化替代局部选择。

Result: 在RGB-D Scenes V2和7-Scenes数据集上实验，取得了最先进的配准性能。

Conclusion: CAA和GOS模块有效提升了图像到点云的配准精度。

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over
time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI.
As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to
maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational
overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats,
which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from
sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module
that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused,
local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats
supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal
segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved
reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust
foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying

equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &

generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image

lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB
references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks

Motivation: 解决在源数据不可用时，无源域自适应目标检测中伪标签噪声高导致模型性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出TITAN方法，将目标域图像分为与源域相似（易）和不相似（难）两部分，利用检测方差进行划分，并引入查询-令牌对抗模块以减少域间差异。

Result: 在四个自然图像数据集和两个医学数据集上验证，TITAN性能优于现有方法，mAP提升显著（最高+22.7%）。

Conclusion: TITAN通过有效分离目标域和减少域间差异，显著提升了无源域自适应目标检测的性能。

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD)
problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must
adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem
employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where
pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further
fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades
drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high
noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a
significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we
propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which
separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source
(easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance
to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher
detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the
source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into
a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two
feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets
and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior
performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7
percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks,
respectively.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，YOLO-FDA在精度和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA通过创新的特征融合和细节增强策略，显著提升了工业缺陷检测的性能。

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于树结构的语义损失函数，用于改进稀疏标注的高光谱图像（HSI）分割任务，并实现OOD像素检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法对生物医学分割任务中的错误惩罚过于均等，未能利用标签空间的语义层次结构。

Method: 引入两种树状语义损失函数，结合稀疏标注训练方法，利用标签的层次结构。

Result: 在包含107类的稀疏标注HSI数据集上达到SOTA性能，同时有效检测OOD像素。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了分割性能，并支持OOD检测，适用于临床语义树结构标签。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

*Pufan Li,Bi'an Du,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法，通过整合几何和感知先验，从单张图像重建高保真3D物体，无需额外训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多视角一致性和几何细节上表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 训练三个高斯分支（几何先验、感知先验、高斯噪声），通过交互和重投影策略优化。

Result: 实验显示方法在3D重建和新视角合成上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 方法能生成一致且高保真的3D物体。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TAM的拓扑感知建模框架，用于解决3D点云数据中的Sim2Real领域适应问题，通过利用全局空间拓扑和自监督学习任务来减少领域差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D点云数据因采集方法不同导致几何变化显著，现有无监督领域适应方法因缺乏鲁棒的域不敏感描述符而难以应对Sim2Real领域差距。

Method: 提出TAM框架，结合全局空间拓扑和局部几何特征的拓扑关系建模，并采用跨域对比学习和自训练策略。

Result: 在三个公开Sim2Real基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAM框架有效减少了领域差距，提升了点云分类的泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

Conclusion: 该研究是首次尝试从人类视角通过视频预测建模复杂现实环境和具身行为。

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given
the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By
conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy
of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the
environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive
conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of
real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a
hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling
a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control
abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of
modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with
video prediction from the perspective of a human.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了OoD检测能力，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing
a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing
methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases
the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards.
To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic
Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the
gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that
injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion
patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360.
We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D
semantic occupancy prediction, with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF)
leveraging an RWKV-based branch to enhance OoD detection via geometry-semantic
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art
OoD detection with an AuROC of 67.34% and an AuPRCr of 29.21% within a 1.2m
region, while maintaining competitive occupancy prediction performance. The
established datasets and source code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出GroundFlow模块，用于在3D点云序列定位任务中提取历史信息，显著提升现有3DVG方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DVG方法无法有效处理多步文本指令中的代词和上下文依赖，导致在SG3D任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出GroundFlow模块，选择性提取短期和长期历史信息，增强时间推理能力。

Result: 在SG3D基准测试中，GroundFlow显著提升基线方法性能（+7.5%和+10.2%），超越预训练3D大语言模型。

Conclusion: GroundFlow为3DVG模型引入时间推理能力，在SG3D任务中实现最优性能。

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需源数据的全景图像分割方法UNLOCK，解决了传统方法依赖源数据的问题，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景图像处理面临失真、遮挡和标注不足的挑战，传统方法依赖源数据，限制了实用性。

Method: 提出UNLOCK框架，包含Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning和Amodal-Driven Context Learning模块，无需源数据或目标标签。

Result: 在真实到真实和合成到真实的适应设置中，性能接近依赖源数据的方法，mAAP和mAP分别达到10.9和11.6。

Conclusion: UNLOCK为全景图像分割提供了实用且高效的解决方案，性能优越且开源。

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet
faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited
annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the
source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前医学图像分析系统任务单一、灵活性不足的问题，提供一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合LLM（Llama-4-17B）进行高级任务规划和模块化CNN（DeepFusionLab）进行低级图像处理，通过动态路由任务特定权重实现灵活性。

Result: 在19个公共数据集上测试，覆盖12种任务和5种成像模态，实现了97%的端到端正确率和2.5秒的平均推理延迟，分割和分类性能优异。

Conclusion: MedPrompt通过结合LLM的解释性和模块化CNN的效率，实现了可扩展的、基于提示的医学图像分析。

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring
separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility
to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce
MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language
Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional
Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM
interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically
route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids
retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific
weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated
MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging
modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting
and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of
2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab
achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and
strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall,
MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the
interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练模型或合成数据，性能受限于模型能力或数据质量。本文发现高质量参考集对OVS任务至关重要。

Method: 设计了一个数据质量导向的框架，包括构建高质量参考集的数据流程和基于相似性的检索方法。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于所有现有无需训练的OVS方法。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的优化设计对无需训练的OVS任务具有重要推动作用。

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉数据中虚假相关性对分布外性能的负面影响，现有方法仅关注图像特征，DiMPLe则跨模态解耦特征。

Method: 结合三个目标：不变与虚假特征的互信息最小化、虚假特征正则化、不变特征的对比学习。

Result: 在11个数据集上优于CoOp-OOD，基础类准确率提升15.27，新类准确率提升44.31。

Conclusion: DiMPLe在多模态学习中表现出色，具有更好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel
approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and
language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual
data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods
focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and
across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better
generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our
method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization
between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization,
and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when
averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in

Result: 在五个基准HMS数据集上进行了广泛实验，使用不同特征提取器均取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: TR²C方法在复杂背景下表现优异，为HMS任务提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into
non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention
recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace
clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional
temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the
frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may
not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering
($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and
affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured
representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent
and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We
conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve
state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

Motivation: 现实中的目标检测系统需要同时学习新类别和适应环境变化，现有方法（CIOD和DIOD）仅解决单一方面问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出DuET框架，基于任务算术模型合并，通过方向一致性损失减少符号冲突，支持多种检测器（如YOLO11和RT-DETR）。

Result: 在Pascal Series和Diverse Weather Series上，DuET分别实现了+13.12%和+11.39%的RAI提升，同时保持了高平均保留指数。

Conclusion: DuET在双增量学习任务中表现出色，为实时目标检测提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and
surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously
adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class
Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection
(DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen
domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new
classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more
practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an
exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging
framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign
conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods,
DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function
as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both
retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI),
which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting
and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common
ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series
demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while
preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39%
RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks),
outperforming existing methods.

Motivation: 现有基于图像的试穿方法在视频中表现不佳，而基于扩散的方法虽有所改进但仍存在一致性问题。

Method: 将视频虚拟试穿建模为条件视频修复任务，采用基于扩散变换器的3D时空注意力框架，结合掩码策略和多阶段训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，ViTI在时空一致性和细节保留上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViTI通过视频生成框架解决了传统试穿方法的一致性问题，为视频虚拟试穿提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in
consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output
video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the
details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames.
Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results
due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods,
though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal
attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task,
which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In
this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement
video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different
from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem
instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better
spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video
inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D
spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video
garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage
training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with
appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal
consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to
the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as
expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI
is superior to previous works.

Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images
remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level
controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA)
framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and
local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image
(T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes
selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This
allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text
rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further
enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to
guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and
the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote
disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The
datasets and source code will be available for academic use.

*Diego Biagini,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraSurg提出了一种层次感知的手术视频生成框架，通过两阶段扩散模型结合手术阶段、动作和分割信息，显著提升了视频生成的质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术视频生成方法缺乏对手术动作和阶段的细粒度一致性，限制了其在真实模拟中的应用。

Method: HieraSurg采用两阶段扩散模型：第一阶段预测粗粒度语义变化，第二阶段结合细粒度视觉特征生成视频。

Result: 在胆囊切除术视频生成任务中，HieraSurg在定量和定性上均优于现有方法，并能生成更高帧率的视频。

Conclusion: HieraSurg展示了在多层次抽象信息下的强泛化能力，为实际手术应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction
following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation.
Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are
unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and
phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary
for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a
hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two
specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame,
HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a
segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a
second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with
fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and
integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages
surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical
phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental
results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model
significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively,
showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher
frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when
provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for
practical surgical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CoSMAE的持续自监督学习方法，通过数据混合和模型混合知识蒸馏，减少了灾难性遗忘问题，并在遥感领域取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续学习方法在遥感领域需要大量标注数据，成本高且不现实。CoSMAE旨在通过自监督学习解决这一问题。

Method: CoSMAE结合了数据混合（保留先前数据分布）和模型混合知识蒸馏（从过去和当前模型中提取知识），通过正则化MAE在数据和模型层面实现更好的泛化。

Result: 实验结果显示，CoSMAE比现有持续学习方法在MAE上提升了4.94%。

Conclusion: CoSMAE通过数据和模型层面的混合策略，有效减少了灾难性遗忘，提升了持续学习性能。

Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new
tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has
gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS,
while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting.
This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is
costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we
propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of
masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two
components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data
mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions
by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous
tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling
knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by
interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge
distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at
the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and
reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that
CoSMAE achieves significant improvements of up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art
CL methods applied to MAE. Our code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored
challenge for document intelligence and visual question answering (VQA)
systems. We present \drishtikon, a multi-granular visual grounding framework
designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual
documents. Our approach integrates robust multi-lingual OCR, large language
models, and a novel region matching algorithm to accurately localize answer
spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from
the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations
across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level
granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation
studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning.
Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the
limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the
effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave
the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in
real-world, text-centric scenarios. Code and dataset has been made available at

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂人体姿态和动作任务中表现不佳，缺乏专用数据是主要原因。

Method: 整合人体关键点与视觉特征（如标题和边界框），构建包含200,328样本的数据集，用于微调模型，并建立E-HPAUB基准评估性能。

Result: 微调后的LLaVA-Pose模型在基准测试中表现显著提升，总体性能提高33.2%。

Conclusion: 整合关键点的数据能有效增强多模态模型在人体姿态和动作理解任务中的表现。

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual
understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex
visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized
vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for
generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual
features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise
understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset
comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric
tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex
reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding
Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action
understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and
evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant
improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2%
compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models for
human-centric visual understanding. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖2D全景分割和测试时优化，未能充分利用多视角空间关系，且计算成本高。

Method: 基于MUSt3R改进，引入语义感知和多视角全景分割能力，并优化掩码合并流程。

Result: PanSt3R在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，且速度显著快于现有方法。

Conclusion: PanSt3R是一种简单、快速且可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了3D场景全景分割的效率。

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and
classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is
a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images.
Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract
per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric
representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions.
We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D
and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential
of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera
parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive
test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a
unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for
test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view
panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent
advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view
version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view
panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard
post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach
for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating
novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.
Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being
orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物理驱动的通用框架，用于解决电磁逆散射问题（EISP），通过引入感应电流作为中间表示，显著提高了重建精度、泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法（如Img-Interiors）在EISP中存在泛化能力差、对稀疏发射器设置敏感等问题，需要改进。

Method: 将EISP重新表述为两阶段逆传输-散射过程，设计了一个包含电流估计器和介电常数求解器的端到端框架。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在重建精度、泛化能力和鲁棒性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该研究为电磁逆散射提供了新视角，是电磁成像实用化的重要进展。

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in
applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the
relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse
process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly
challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows
promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it
requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and
fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To
address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective,
reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This
formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate
representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from
the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first
generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator
and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current
estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between
the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the
relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design
enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of
relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to
transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic
inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical
solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电影摄影是电影的核心视觉语言，但现有的视觉语言模型在理解电影语法方面表现不足，缺乏有效的评估工具。

Method: 提出了ShotBench基准测试和ShotQA数据集，并通过监督微调和Group Relative Policy Optimization开发了ShotVL模型。

Result: 现有模型在ShotBench上表现不佳（最高准确率低于60%），而ShotVL显著优于其他模型，达到新SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ShotBench和ShotQA为电影语言理解提供了重要工具，ShotVL的提出推动了AI在电影领域的应用。

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for
conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding,
their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded
within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation.
This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the
precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA
pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed
(predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography
dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their
substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\%
average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and
complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct
\textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k
cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through
supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL
significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on
ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We
open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial
area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

Conclusion: CoPa-SG为场景理解提供了更丰富的数据和关系表示，增强了模型的实用性和解释性。

Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene
understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate
scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a
synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive
relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and
proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former
provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional
counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or
distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and
describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene.
Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation
models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in
downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.

Result: 在KITTI和Cityscapes3D数据集上验证，标注质量高，成本低且可扩展。

Conclusion: ToosiCubix为高质量3D立方体标注提供了一种经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive
and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their
accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a
simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only
monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only
about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D
annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized
equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge,
symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each
vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8
DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem,
which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between
Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common
ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate
probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our
annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our
method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid
annotation.

Motivation: 现有方法主要从有限的正常样本中提取原型，但忽略了利用查询图像统计信息来增强原型的代表性。

Method: FastRef通过线性重构和最优传输（OT）技术，分两阶段迭代优化原型：特征转移和异常抑制。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，FastRef在1/2/4-shot设置下既有效又高效。

Conclusion: FastRef通过系统整合查询图像统计信息，显著提升了少样本工业异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge
for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce
environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving
prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to
systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype
representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and
efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates
through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query
features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)
anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is
achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while
the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike
conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting
makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal
transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the
gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.
For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive
prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.
Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and
RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our
approach under 1/2/4-shots.

Motivation: 现有方法采用两阶段流程（边缘点云重建和参数曲线拟合），存在优化间隙导致的误差累积问题。本文旨在通过一阶段方法直接优化3D参数曲线。

Method: 提出了一种双向耦合机制，将参数曲线与边缘导向的高斯组件结合，形成可微渲染的曲线感知表示（CurveGaussian），并引入动态自适应拓扑优化框架。

Result: 在ABC数据集和真实场景基准测试中，该方法优于两阶段方法，重建结果更干净、更鲁棒，且训练参数更少。

Conclusion: 直接优化参数曲线的一阶段方法显著提高了效率和性能，为3D曲线重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric
curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage
methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and
parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D
parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation
caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,
parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view
optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their
geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a
novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and
edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a
curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables
differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by
multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology
optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through
linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive
evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our
one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in
producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly
optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter
count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: XVerse显著提升了复杂场景和个性化图像生成的能力。

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes
(pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple
subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from
attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference
images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows
for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting
image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable
multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject
characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly
improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

Conclusion: 结合几何约束和深度正则化的3DGS SLAM方法在内窥镜场景中表现出色，代码将公开。

Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are
critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D
reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing
both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges
include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and
dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To
address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a
geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the
scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation
strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the
validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve
scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement
strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal
rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive
experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both
static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from
erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively
impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and
characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.
In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network
predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image
and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector
collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly
learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,
HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density
areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment
organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two
3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the
AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real
unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a
structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant
systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet
parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying
learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator
dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT

Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an
independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their
identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle
morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among
pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis
dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive
benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic
figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with
linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF
datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer
cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++
training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135,
0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and
AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for
LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows
that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be
effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning
and model fine-tuning techniques. We make available all code and data used in
this paper in this github repository:

Conclusion: 该方法实现了精确的位置和外观控制，适用于复杂场景中的对象编辑。

Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the
advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects
in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a
challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or
prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined
with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We
design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible
enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on
an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to
methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare
different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are
designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in
terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial
shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with
appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make
emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in
assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on
reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential
solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training
datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This
paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable
the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential
emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various
mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection
algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several
state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11,
and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency
situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing
reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be
deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for
future research in this critical safety application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高引导尺度在条件扩散模型中虽能增强性能，但会导致过饱和和不真实伪影，低频信号中的冗余信息是主要原因。

Method: 提出LF-CFG方法，通过自适应阈值定位冗余信息，并分析低频信息变化率确定合理阈值，采用降权策略减少冗余信息影响。

Result: 实验表明，LF-CFG在多种扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion-XL等）中有效缓解了过饱和和不真实伪影。

Conclusion: LF-CFG通过低频信号改进，成功解决了高引导尺度带来的问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that
use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional
terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the
conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in
oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new
perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of
redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation
and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency
improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues.
Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint
the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by
analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and
current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of
redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic
artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL,
Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

Motivation: 转向运动计数数据对交通信号设计、交叉口规划和拥堵分析至关重要，但现有方法难以适应多样化的交通模式。

Method: 开发了基于视觉的跟踪系统估计TMC，结合仿真工具SUMO评估信号配置，并提出了动态、静态和混合三种信号设计方法。

Result: 实验表明，90和120秒的周期时间效果最佳；动态配置适用于多数交叉口，而混合方法在高峰和非高峰时段表现更好。

Conclusion: 混合信号方法能根据交通模式动态调整，适用于交通分布不均的场景，而静态方法适用于均匀分布的情况。

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,
intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This
work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration
for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to
estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The
intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal
configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into
Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The
initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the
cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,
four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing
configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of
total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic
flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that
switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak
traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic
generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and
a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,
dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted
differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse
traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4
hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions
affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for
evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly
weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a
significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge
by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the
transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship
between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we
introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the
explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework
optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By
leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation
model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our
experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval
tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the
existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks
such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and
segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the
model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However,
these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and
loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic
foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to
quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not
make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is
truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as
automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this
work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.
Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used
to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as
bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of
bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a
likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for
whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of
performance.

Motivation: 现有训练无关的解码策略存在静态约束、效率低下和细节退化等问题，无法有效解决LVLM的幻觉问题。

Result: 实验表明，DLC在多种LVLM架构上显著减少幻觉，优于现有方法，同时保持高效推理。

Conclusion: DLC是一种高效且有效的解码时解决方案，提升了LVLM的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by
hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing
training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the
use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during
generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,
and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a
novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text
generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC
step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image
and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of
candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual
baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually
grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time
context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring
the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted
across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,
InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces
hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference
efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an
effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,
thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be
released on Github.

Conclusion: GGTalker通过通用先验和个体适应解决了3D说话头部合成的核心挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a
persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed
viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head
rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained
by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core
issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation
capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose
GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of
generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage
Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to
individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual
priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general
distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual
speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we
introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a
Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing
indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show
that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D
consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: G²D有效解决了模态不平衡问题，提升了多模态学习的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities
to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal
models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities
dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and
underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce
Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework
that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that
fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a
dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning
process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the
pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D
on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the
significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic
modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting.
However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original
observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly
altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a
memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities
of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with
visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank.
Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg}
car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the
most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding
3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through
orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide
complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling
photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as
demonstrated in our experiments. Project page:

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了集合表示中的问题，提升了跨模态检索性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse
possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional
methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,
but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across
modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple
embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more
diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,
these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse
supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize
one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity
within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the
representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among
embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k
without relying on external data.

Conclusion: StruMamba3D通过改进SSM处理方式，显著提升了点云表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in
point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with
the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these
methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying
the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain
long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To
address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for
self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits.
First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial
dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update
strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions
between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method
reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input
lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental
results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our
method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的遮挡感知多视角生成框架，用于从单张部分遮挡图像生成六种结构一致的新视角，支持下游3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于扩散的视角合成模型在输入图像部分遮挡时生成不一致视角和3D重建质量下降的问题。

Method: 构建自监督训练流程，利用Pix2Gestalt数据集中的遮挡-未遮挡图像对和伪真实视角，联合学习补全和多视角生成。

Result: 无需修改原始架构即可实现结构感知补全和视角一致性，并提出了首个遮挡感知重建基准。

Conclusion: 该方法在部分遮挡条件下显著提升了多视角生成和3D重建的质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge,
especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view
synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,
they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object
are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction
quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for
occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six
structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,
enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or
manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the
Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and
pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and
view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully
fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view
generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware
reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and
mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating
future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶场景中相机和LiDAR数据的跨模态分割问题，并避免人工标注的瓶颈。

Method: 引入统一多模态位置编码（UMPE）对齐特征，提出运动感知跨模态记忆注意力（MCMA）增强时序一致性，开发多模态自动数据引擎生成伪标签。

Result: 在Waymo-4DSeg数据集上展示了强大的跨模态分割能力和高效的数据标注潜力。

Conclusion: SAM4D在跨模态分割和数据标注方面表现出色，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for
promptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal
Positional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in
a shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction.
Additionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA),
which leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and
long-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically
changing autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop
a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,
spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This
framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of
magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic
fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on
the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal
segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SiM3D是首个结合多视角和多模态信息的3D异常检测与分割（ADS）基准，专注于单实例异常检测，并首次解决从合成训练数据泛化到真实测试数据的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中对单实例异常检测的需求，以及现有方法在多视角和多模态数据整合上的不足。

Method: 提出SiM3D基准，包含多模态多视角数据集（高分辨率图像和点云），并采用新指标评估性能。

Result: SiM3D数据集包含333个实例的八类对象，提供手动标注的3D分割GT，并建立了基准性能。

Conclusion: SiM3D为多视角3D ADS任务提供了首个基准，推动了从合成数据到真实数据的泛化研究。

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of
multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and
segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume.
Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing:
single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or
synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the
first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic
training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview
dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset
features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points)
for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each
type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test
samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS
task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using
novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

TL;DR: ClusterRCA是一个用于高性能计算（HPC）系统网络故障诊断的新框架，通过多模态数据定位故障节点和类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因数据异构性和准确性不足，无法直接适用于HPC系统。

Method: ClusterRCA结合分类器和图方法，从拓扑连接的NIC对中提取特征，构建故障图并通过随机游走定位根因。

Result: 实验表明，ClusterRCA在HPC系统中诊断网络故障具有高准确性，并在不同应用场景中保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: ClusterRCA为HPC系统提供了一种高效的网络故障诊断解决方案。

Abstract: Network failure diagnosis is challenging yet critical for high-performance
computing (HPC) systems. Existing methods cannot be directly applied to HPC
scenarios due to data heterogeneity and lack of accuracy. This paper proposes a
novel framework, called ClusterRCA, to localize culprit nodes and determine
failure types by leveraging multimodal data. ClusterRCA extracts features from
topologically connected network interface controller (NIC) pairs to analyze the
diverse, multimodal data in HPC systems. To accurately localize culprit nodes
and determine failure types, ClusterRCA combines classifier-based and
graph-based approaches. A failure graph is constructed based on the output of
the state classifier, and then it performs a customized random walk on the
graph to localize the root cause. Experiments on datasets collected by a
top-tier global HPC device vendor show ClusterRCA achieves high accuracy in
diagnosing network failure for HPC systems. ClusterRCA also maintains robust
performance across different application scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分布式数据分析框架，用于高效处理大规模GPU性能日志，解决了现有工具在内存和运行时上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模GPU性能日志分析需要大量内存和时间，限制了性能分析的及时性和自动化工作流的集成。

Method: 引入分布式框架，将数据集分区为可独立分析的片段，并通过MPI并行处理，减少单节点内存压力。

Result: 框架成功应用于真实HPC和AI工作负载的Nsight Compute跟踪数据，诊断了性能变异性并揭示了内存传输延迟对GPU内核行为的影响。

Conclusion: 该分布式框架显著提升了大规模性能日志分析的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Analyzing large-scale performance logs from GPU profilers often requires
terabytes of memory and hours of runtime, even for basic summaries. These
constraints prevent timely insight and hinder the integration of performance
analytics into automated workflows. Existing analysis tools typically process
data sequentially, making them ill-suited for HPC workflows with growing trace
complexity and volume. We introduce a distributed data analysis framework that
scales with dataset size and compute availability. Rather than treating the
dataset as a single entity, our system partitions it into independently
analyzable shards and processes them concurrently across MPI ranks. This design
reduces per-node memory pressure, avoids central bottlenecks, and enables
low-latency exploration of high-dimensional trace data. We apply the framework
to end-to-end Nsight Compute traces from real HPC and AI workloads, demonstrate
its ability to diagnose performance variability, and uncover the impact of
memory transfer latency on GPU kernel behavior.

*Anish Saxena,Po-An Tsai,Hritvik Taneja,Aamer Jaleel,Moinuddin Qureshi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: GPU内存带宽是低延迟大型语言模型（LLM）推理的主要瓶颈。推测解码利用空闲GPU计算，通过轻量级草稿器提出K个令牌，LLM并行验证以提高令牌吞吐量。传统密集LLM每次迭代加载全部模型权重，推测不会增加延迟开销。然而，新兴的专家混合（MoE）模型每令牌仅激活部分权重，减少了数据移动。研究发现，推测对MoE无效，因为草稿令牌会激活更多权重，增加数据移动和验证时间2-3倍，甚至导致1.5倍的减速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE模型中推测解码的无效性问题，避免因数据移动和验证时间增加导致的性能下降。

Method: 提出Cascade框架，通过选择性启用推测和动态调整K值来优化MoE服务。Cascade使用轻量级指标“推测效用”（令牌增益与验证成本的比率），通过短期测试和长期设置阶段动态决策。

Result: 在vLLM中实现Cascade，并在五种流行的MoE模型上评估。结果显示，Cascade将减速限制在5%（相比1.5倍），吞吐量提高7-14%，使推测解码在MoE中变得实用。

Conclusion: Cascade框架通过动态调整推测解码策略，成功解决了MoE模型中推测解码的无效性问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: GPU memory bandwidth is the main bottleneck for low-latency Large Language
Model (LLM) inference. Speculative decoding leverages idle GPU compute by using
a lightweight drafter to propose K tokens, which the LLM verifies in parallel,
boosting token throughput. In conventional dense LLMs, all model weights are
fetched each iteration, so speculation adds no latency overhead. Emerging
Mixture of Experts (MoE) models activate only a subset of weights per token,
greatly reducing data movement. However, we show that speculation is
ineffective for MoEs: draft tokens collectively activate more weights,
increasing data movement and verification time by 2-3x. When token throughput
gains fail to offset this overhead, speculation causes slowdowns up to 1.5x,
making it infeasible. Even when useful, the optimal K varies by task, model,
and even between requests and iterations. Thus, despite widespread use in dense
LLMs, speculation remains impractical in leading MoEs.
  We present Cascade, a utility-driven framework that selectively enables
speculation to avoid slowdowns and dynamically tunes K to accelerate MoE
serving. Cascade uses a lightweight metric, speculation utility, the ratio of
token gains to verification cost, which shows iteration-level locality,
enabling periodic decisions via short test and longer set phases. For each
request, Cascade disables speculation if utility drops below one during
testing, and when utility exceeds one, tests multiple K-values to choose the
utility-maximizing K for the set phase. We implement Cascade in vLLM and
evaluate it on five popular MoEs with workloads spanning code, math,
extraction, and mixed tasks. Cascade limits slowdown to 5% (vs. 1.5x) and
improves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding
practical for MoEs.

Motivation: GPGPU架构多样化导致编程模型和软件栈复杂化，现有便携执行模型仍需大量开发工作。LLM的进展有望减轻这一负担。

Method: 提出ParEval-Repo框架，包含多种编程模型的科学计算和AI小应用，评估开源和商业LLM在代码翻译中的表现。

Result: LLM在小程序翻译上可行，但在生成功能性构建系统和跨文件依赖方面面临挑战。

Conclusion: LLM在科学应用翻译上有潜力，但需解决构建系统和跨文件依赖问题以扩展到大代码库。

Abstract: GPGPU architectures have become significantly diverse in recent years, which
has led to an emergence of a variety of specialized programming models and
software stacks to support them. While portable execution models exist, they
still require significant developer effort to port to and optimize for
different hardware architectures. Recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) can help us reduce some of this programmer burden. In this paper, we
present a novel benchmark and testing framework, ParEval-Repo, which can be
used to evaluate the efficacy of LLM-based approaches in automatically
translating entire codebases across GPGPU execution models. ParEval-Repo
includes several scientific computing and AI mini-applications in a range of
programming models, and levels of repository complexity. We use ParEval-Repo to
evaluate a range of state-of-the-art open-source and commercial LLMs, with both
a non-agentic and a top-down agentic approach. We assess code generated by the
LLMs and approaches in terms of compilability, functional correctness,
categories of build errors, and the cost of translation in terms of the number
of inference tokens. Our results demonstrate that LLM translation of scientific
applications is feasible for small programs but difficulty with generating
functional build systems and cross-file dependencies pose challenges in scaling
to larger codebases.

Conclusion: 自动代码生成技术（如DaCe）能够显著提升科学应用的可移植性和可持续性，减少开发者对不同硬件架构的适配负担。

Abstract: With the emergence of new high-performance computing (HPC) accelerators, such
as Nvidia and AMD GPUs, efficiently targeting diverse hardware architectures
has become a major challenge for HPC application developers. The increasing
hardware diversity in HPC systems often necessitates the development of
architecture-specific code, hindering the sustainability of large-scale
scientific applications. In this work, we leverage DaCe, a data-centric
parallel programming framework, to automate the generation of high-performance
kernels. DaCe enables automatic code generation for multicore processors and
various accelerators, reducing the burden on developers who would otherwise
need to rewrite code for each new architecture. Our study demonstrates DaCe's
capabilities by applying its automatic code generation to a critical
computational kernel used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Specifically,
we focus on Neko, a Fortran-based solver that employs the spectral-element
method, which relies on small tensor operations. We detail the formulation of
this computational kernel using DaCe's Stateful Dataflow Multigraph (SDFG)
representation and discuss how this approach facilitates high-performance code
generation. Additionally, we outline the workflow for seamlessly integrating
DaCe's generated code into the Neko solver. Our results highlight the
portability and performance of the generated code across multiple platforms,
including Nvidia GH200, Nvidia A100, and AMD MI250X GPUs, with competitive
performance results. By demonstrating the potential of automatic code
generation, we emphasise the feasibility of using portable solutions to ensure
the long-term sustainability of large-scale scientific applications.

Result: 实验表明，该框架在区块链环境中实现了高效的LLM服务知识共享。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了知识孤岛问题，为LLM提供了可靠的外部知识支持。

Abstract: The hallucination problem of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly
drawn attention. Augmenting LLMs with external knowledge is a promising
solution to address this issue. However, due to privacy and security concerns,
a vast amount of downstream task-related knowledge remains dispersed and
isolated across various "silos," making it difficult to access. To bridge this
knowledge gap, we propose a blockchain-based external knowledge framework that
coordinates multiple knowledge silos to provide reliable foundational knowledge
for large model retrieval while ensuring data security. Technically, we distill
knowledge from local data into prompts and execute transactions and records on
the blockchain. Additionally, we introduce a reputation mechanism and
cross-validation to ensure knowledge quality and provide incentives for
participation. Furthermore, we design a query generation framework that
provides a direct API interface for large model retrieval. To evaluate the
performance of our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on
various knowledge sources. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework
achieves efficient LLM service knowledge sharing in blockchain environments.

Result: 主网测试显示，该架构能在几秒内完成最终确认，执行成本低，支持复杂比特币去中心化应用。

Conclusion: 该架构为比特币智能合约提供了安全高效的解决方案，扩展了其应用场景。

Abstract: There is growing interest in providing programmatic access to the value
locked in Bitcoin, which famously offers limited programmability itself.
Various approaches have been put forth in recent years, with the vast majority
of proposed mechanisms either building new functionality on top of Bitcoin or
leveraging a bridging mechanism to enable smart contracts that make use of
``wrapped'' bitcoins on entirely different platforms.
  In this work, an architecture is presented that follows a different approach.
The architecture enables the execution of Turing-complete Bitcoin smart
contracts on the Internet Computer (IC), a blockchain platform for hosting and
executing decentralized applications. Instead of using a bridge, IC and Bitcoin
nodes interact directly, eliminating potential security risks that the use of a
bridge entails. This integration requires novel concepts, in particular to
reconcile the probabilistic nature of Bitcoin with the irreversibility of
finalized state changes on the IC, which may be of independent interest.
  In addition to the presentation of the architecture, we provide evaluation
results based on measurements of the Bitcoin integration running on mainnet.
The evaluation results demonstrate that, with finalization in a few seconds and
low execution costs, this integration enables complex Bitcoin-based
decentralized applications that were not practically feasible or economically
viable before.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了服务导向应用的碳感知问题。

Abstract: The carbon footprint of data centers has recently become a critical concern.
So far, most carbon-aware strategies have focused on leveraging the flexibility
of scheduling decisions for batch processing by shifting the time and location
of workload executions. However, such approaches cannot be applied to
service-oriented cloud applications, since they have to be reachable at every
point in time and often at low latencies. We propose a carbon-aware approach
for operating microservices under hourly carbon budgets. By choosing the most
appropriate version and horizontal scaleout for each microservice, our strategy
maximizes user experience and revenue while staying within budget constraints.
Experiments across various application configurations and carbon budgets
demonstrate that the approach adapts properly to changing workloads and carbon
intensities.

Abstract: Finding the optimal set of cloud resources to deploy a given workload at

of research. Combining tens of parameters applicable across a large selection

numbers of application-specific parameters leads to configuration spaces with
millions of deployment options.
  In this paper, we propose Discovery Space, an abstraction that formalizes the
description of workload configuration problems, and exhibits a set of
characteristics required for structured, robust and distributed investigations
of large search spaces. We describe a concrete implementation of the Discovery
Space abstraction and show that it is generalizable across a diverse set of
workloads such as Large Language Model inference and Big Data Analytics.
  We demonstrate that our approach enables safe, transparent sharing of data
between executions of best-of-breed optimizers increasing the efficiency of
optimal configuration detection in large search spaces. We also demonstrate how
Discovery Spaces enable transfer and reuse of knowledge across similar search
spaces, enabling configuration search speed-ups of over 90%.

Conclusion: 漂移自适应切片方案显著优化了资源管理和服务性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel drift-adaptive slicing-based resource
management scheme for cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
networks. Particularly, we establish two network slices to provide sensing and
communication services, respectively. In the large-timescale planning for the
slices, we partition the sensing region of interest (RoI) of each mobile device
and reserve network resources accordingly, facilitating low-complexity
distance-based sensing target assignment in small timescales. To cope with the
non-stationary spatial distributions of mobile devices and sensing targets,
which can result in the drift in modeling the distributions and ineffective
planning decisions, we construct digital twins (DTs) of the slices. In each DT,
a drift-adaptive statistical model and an emulation function are developed for
the spatial distributions in the corresponding slice, which facilitates
closed-form decision-making and efficient validation of a planning decision,

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自适应路由算法flowcut switching，确保高性能的有序数据包传输，适用于各种网络条件，包括非突发流量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络延迟严重影响超级计算机上应用程序的性能，现有自适应路由算法可能导致数据包乱序，影响性能。

Method: 提出flowcut switching算法，不同于现有的flowlet switching，它能保证任何网络条件下的有序传输。

Result: flowcut switching在非突发流量（如RDMA）下仍能有效工作，避免了数据包乱序问题。

Conclusion: flowcut switching是一种高效的自适应路由算法，适用于多种网络条件，解决了现有算法的局限性。

Abstract: Network latency severely impacts the performance of applications running on
supercomputers. Adaptive routing algorithms route packets over different
available paths to reduce latency and improve network utilization. However, if
a switch routes packets belonging to the same network flow on different paths,
they might arrive at the destination out-of-order due to differences in the
latency of these paths. For some transport protocols like TCP, QUIC, and RoCE,
out-of-order (OOO) packets might cause large performance drops or significantly
increase CPU utilization. In this work, we propose flowcut switching, a new
adaptive routing algorithm that provides high-performance in-order packet
delivery. Differently from existing solutions like flowlet switching, which are
based on the assumption of bursty traffic and that might still reorder packets,
flowcut switching guarantees in-order delivery under any network conditions,
and is effective also for non-bursty traffic, as it is often the case for RDMA.

contributions, including methods, techniques, and tools to incorporate domain
knowledge into RE practices. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study
using a hybrid search strategy that combines database searches with iterative
backward and forward snowballing. [Results] In total, we found 75 papers that
met our inclusion criteria. The analysis highlights the main types of
requirements addressed, the most frequently considered quality attributes, and
recurring challenges in the formalization, acquisition, and long-term
maintenance of domain knowledge. The results provide support for researchers
and practitioners in identifying established approaches and unresolved issues.
The study also outlines promising directions for future research, emphasizing
the development of scalable, automated, and sustainable solutions to integrate
domain knowledge into RE processes. [Conclusion] The study contributes by
providing a comprehensive overview that helps to build a conceptual and
methodological foundation for knowledge-driven requirements engineering.

Abstract: [Context] Machine learning (ML)-enabled systems are present in our society,
driving significant digital transformations. The dynamic nature of ML
development, characterized by experimental cycles and rapid changes in data,
poses challenges to traditional project management. Agile methods, with their
flexibility and incremental delivery, seem well-suited to address this
dynamism. However, it is unclear how to effectively apply these methods in the
context of ML-enabled systems, where challenges require tailored approaches.
[Goal] Our goal is to outline the state of the art in agile management for
ML-enabled systems. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study using a
hybrid search strategy that combines database searches with backward and
forward snowballing iterations. [Results] Our study identified 27 papers
published between 2008 and 2024. From these, we identified eight frameworks and
categorized recommendations and practices into eight key themes, such as
Iteration Flexibility, Innovative ML-specific Artifacts, and the Minimal Viable
Model. The main challenge identified across studies was accurate effort
estimation for ML-related tasks. [Conclusion] This study contributes by mapping
the state of the art and identifying open gaps in the field. While relevant
work exists, more robust empirical evaluation is still needed to validate these
contributions.

Motivation: 随着数据和知识的快速扩展，需要一种更易用的方法来集成Neo4j数据库与OWL，以解决现有方法对描述逻辑（DL）语法的依赖问题。

Method: 利用Python和rdflib库开发了一种自动化脚本，从Neo4j数据库中提取数据并生成OWL所需的类和公理。

Conclusion: 该方法为快速增长的药物不良事件数据集提供了一种实用的本体生成解决方案，有助于提升药物安全监测和公共卫生决策。

Abstract: As data and knowledge expand rapidly, adopting systematic methodologies for
ontology generation has become crucial. With the daily increases in data
volumes and frequent content changes, the demand for databases to store and
retrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become
increasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and
Representation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address
these challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this
methodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j
databases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate
data from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches
often require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not
be familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to
bridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes
Python and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our
novel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
database. Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically
generates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother
integration process. This approach offers a practical solution to the
challenges of ontology generation in the context of rapidly growing adverse
drug event datasets, supporting improved drug safety monitoring and public
health decision-making.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach
for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing
limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a
lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based
implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general
user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons
learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed
for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture,
industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates
multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted
LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs.
A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the
systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii)
Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of
Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we
documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and
ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in
practice.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合强化学习（RL）和人类指导的方法，用于开发复杂的模型转换（MT）序列，以提高效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动开发复杂的模型转换序列容易出错且难以实现，而强化学习在复杂问题中表现不佳，因此需要结合人类指导来提升性能。

Method: 提出了一种技术框架，将用户定义的模型转换映射到强化学习原语中，并通过RL程序执行以找到最优的MT序列。

Result: 评估表明，即使人类建议存在不确定性，也能显著提高RL性能，并更高效地开发复杂MT序列。

Conclusion: 该方法通过权衡人类建议的确定性和及时性，为RL驱动的人机协同工程方法迈出了一步。

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations
(MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of
such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design
space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often
infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate
these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial
and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL
methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations,
human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach
and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided
by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to
be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal
MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain,
substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient
development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and
timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven
human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

TL;DR: IFMA-VD是一个基于深度学习的漏洞检测框架，通过分析函数间的多边关联关系提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注独立函数，忽略了函数间复杂的多边关联，可能导致漏洞检测不全面。

Method: 构建代码行为超图，利用超边卷积提取多边关联特征，结合程序依赖图和超图网络增强检测能力。

Result: 在三个数据集上验证，F-measure和Recall优于基线方法，多边关联特征提升了代码特征表示。

Conclusion: IFMA-VD通过多边关联分析有效提升了漏洞检测性能，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Vulnerability detection is a crucial yet challenging technique for ensuring
the security of software systems. Currently, most deep learning-based
vulnerability detection methods focus on stand-alone functions, neglecting the
complex inter-function interrelations, particularly the multilateral
associations. This oversight can fail to detect vulnerabilities in these
interrelations. To address this gap, we present an Inter-Function Multilateral
Association analysis framework for Vulnerability Detection (IFMA-VD). The
cornerstone of the IFMA-VD lies in constructing a code behavior hypergraph and
utilizing hyperedge convolution to extract multilateral association features.
Specifically, we first parse functions into a code property graph to generate
intra-function features. Following this, we construct a code behavior
hypergraph by segmenting the program dependency graph to isolate and encode
behavioral features into hyperedges. Finally, we utilize a hypergraph network
to capture the multilateral association knowledge for augmenting vulnerability
detection. We evaluate IFMA-VD on three widely used vulnerability datasets and
demonstrate improvements in F-measure and Recall compared to baseline methods.
Additionally, we illustrate that multilateral association features can boost
code feature representation and validate the effectiveness of IFMA-VD on
real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开标记的需求数据集稀缺阻碍了AI4RE的发展，需要系统化的方法来控制和优化合成数据的质量。

Method: 采用多样本提示、自动提示优化（PACE）和后生成筛选技术，评估四种分类任务的数据质量。

Result: 多样本提示显著提升数据效用和多样性；PACE对功能分类效果显著；合成数据在安全和缺陷分类任务中超越人工数据。

Conclusion: Synthline v1为AI4RE提供了实用见解，通过系统化合成生成缓解数据集稀缺问题。

Abstract: The shortage of publicly available, labeled requirements datasets remains a
major barrier to advancing Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering
(AI4RE). While Large Language Models offer promising capabilities for synthetic
data generation, systematic approaches to control and optimize the quality of
generated requirements remain underexplored. This paper presents Synthline v1,
an enhanced Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data
that extends our earlier v0 version with advanced generation strategies and
curation techniques. We investigate four research questions assessing how
prompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation
curation affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect
detection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security
vs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting
significantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation,
with F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic
Editing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results,
greatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing
performance on others. Interestingly, similarity-based curation improves
diversity but often harms classification performance, indicating that some
redundancy may help ML models. Most importantly, our results show that
synthetic requirements can match or outperform human-authored ones for specific
tasks, with synthetic data surpassing human data for security (+7.8 points) and
defect classification (+15.4 points). These findings offer practical insights
for AI4RE and chart a viable path to mitigating dataset scarcity through
systematic synthetic generation.

Motivation: 由于自动程序修复（APR）任务需要复杂的逻辑和多步推理能力，目前链式思考（CoT）技术在该领域的应用仍显不足。

Method: 研究系统评估了几种常见的CoT技术在APR任务中的表现，并提出了$T^3$框架，将LLMs的推理能力与树搜索相结合。

Result: $T^3$框架有效提高了生成候选修复方案的精度，并为优化样本选择和修复策略提供了指导。

Conclusion: $T^3$框架为高效自动化调试建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a core technology in software development
and maintenance, with aims to enable automated defect repair with minimal human
intervention. In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the
complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT
techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically
evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and
proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning
capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of
generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable
guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks,
establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据收集工具在代码粒度控制、编程环境事件收集和配置难度方面存在不足，需要更灵活的工具。

Method: 开发KOALA插件，安装在IDE中，配置任务、IDE功能开关和调查，收集代码快照、IDE操作和额外数据（如快捷键使用）。

Result: 工具成功收集了28名学生在两门课程中的编程数据，并转换为标准ProgSnap2格式。

Conclusion: KOALA为研究者和教育者提供了更便捷、灵活的数据收集方式，展示了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Collecting data of students solving programming tasks is incredibly valuable
for researchers and educators. It allows verifying that the students correctly
apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students'
misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g.,
no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the
specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to
configure.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly
configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students
solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in
IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or
disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During
problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured
granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data
not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between
files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where
it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To
showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two
courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.

Method: 结合学术与灰色文献调查微前端现状，并在一个手工艺品市场平台实施该架构，通过半开放式问卷评估。

Result: 微前端成功实施，但分析显示其他方案（如单体前端）也能满足需求；其优势在于与现有微服务架构的兼容性。

Conclusion: 微前端在特定场景下（如已有微服务架构）更具优势，但需权衡复杂性和必要性。

Abstract: In the micro frontends architectural style, the frontend is divided into
smaller components, which can range from a simple button to an entire page. The
goal is to improve scalability, resilience, and team independence, albeit at
the cost of increased complexity and infrastructure demands. This paper seeks
to understand when it is worth adopting micro frontends, particularly in the
context of industry. To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the
state of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray
literature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for
handcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated
the implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At
the studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to
the tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated
frontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor
developer experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture
was adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and
technologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro
Frontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's
needs. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other
alternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable
results. What made adopting micro frontends the most convenient choice in the
company's context was the monolith strangulation and microservices adoption,
which facilitated implementation through infrastructure reuse and knowledge
sharing between teams.

Result: 核心模型成功整合了现有模型的关键特征，支持数据共享和协作。

Conclusion: 该模型为物联网数据与流程数据的集成提供了统一框架，促进了过程挖掘领域的发展。

Abstract: Advances in Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies have prompted the
integration of IoT devices with business processes (BPs) in many organizations
across various sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare and smart spaces. The
proliferation of IoT devices leads to the generation of large amounts of IoT
data providing a window on the physical context of BPs, which facilitates the
discovery of new insights about BPs using process mining (PM) techniques.
However, to achieve these benefits, IoT data need to be combined with
traditional process (event) data, which is challenging due to the very
different characteristics of IoT and process data, for instance in terms of
granularity levels. Recently, several data models were proposed to integrate
IoT data with process data, each focusing on different aspects of data
integration based on different assumptions and requirements. This fragmentation
hampers data exchange and collaboration in the field of PM, e.g., making it
tedious for researchers to share data. In this paper, we present a core model
synthesizing the most important features of existing data models. As the core
model is based on common requirements, it greatly facilitates data sharing and
collaboration in the field. A prototypical Python implementation is used to
evaluate the model against various use cases and demonstrate that it satisfies
these common requirements.

Conclusion: 新方法解决了现有问题，适用于多种数据生成过程，同时指出了多重检验和非线性估计的潜在问题。

Abstract: This paper studies analytic inference along two dimensions of clustering. In
such setups, the commonly used approach has two drawbacks. First, the
corresponding variance estimator is not necessarily positive. Second, inference
is invalid in non-Gaussian regimes, namely when the estimator of the parameter
of interest is not asymptotically Gaussian. We consider a simple fix that
addresses both issues. In Gaussian regimes, the corresponding tests are
asymptotically exact and equivalent to usual ones. Otherwise, the new tests are
asymptotically conservative. We also establish their uniform validity over a
certain class of data generating processes. Independently of our tests, we
highlight potential issues with multiple testing and nonlinear estimators under
two-way clustering. Finally, we compare our approach with existing ones through
simulations.

Conclusion: 研究为加密市场风险分层提供了框架，对投资组合设计和监管有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper analyzes realized return behavior across a broad set of crypto
assets by estimating heterogeneous exposures to idiosyncratic and systematic
risk. A key challenge arises from the latent nature of broader economy-wide
risk sources: macro-financial proxies are unavailable at high-frequencies,
while the abundance of low-frequency candidates offers limited guidance on
empirical relevance. To address this, we develop a two-stage
``divide-and-conquer'' approach. The first stage estimates exposures to
high-frequency idiosyncratic and market risk only, using asset-level IV
regressions. The second stage identifies latent economy-wide factors by
extracting the leading principal component from the model residuals and mapping
it to lower-frequency macro-financial uncertainty and sentiment-based
indicators via high-dimensional variable selection. Structured patterns of
heterogeneity in exposures are uncovered using Mean Group estimators across
asset categories. The method is applied to a broad sample of crypto assets,
covering more than 80% of total market capitalization. We document short-term
mean reversion and significant average exposures to idiosyncratic volatility
and illiquidity. Green and DeFi assets are, on average, more exposed to
market-level and economy-wide risk than their non-Green and non-DeFi
counterparts. By contrast, stablecoins are less exposed to idiosyncratic,
market-level, and economy-wide risk factors relative to non-stablecoins. At a
conceptual level, our study develops a coherent framework for isolating
distinct layers of risk in crypto markets. Empirically, it sheds light on how
return sensitivities vary across digital asset categories -- insights that are
important for both portfolio design and regulatory oversight.

Motivation: 标准方法在每一层次单独估计GE，无法保证与多级分解的兼容性。

Method: 约束较低层次的GE估计以匹配较高层次的基准，同时保持层次间关系。

Result: 应用于日本收入数据，估计国家、都道府县和市町村层次的GE，分解国家不平等为都道府县间和都道府县内不平等，并进一步分解都道府县GE为市町村间和市町村内不平等。

Conclusion: 该方法在多级分解中实现了GE的兼容性和层次一致性。

Abstract: We propose a method for multilevel decomposition of generalized entropy (GE)
measures that explicitly accounts for nested population structures such as
national, regional, and subregional levels. Standard approaches that estimate
GE separately at each level do not guarantee compatibility with multilevel
decomposition. Our method constrains lower-level GE estimates to match
higher-level benchmarks while preserving hierarchical relationships across
layers. We apply the method to Japanese income data to estimate GE at the
national, prefectural, and municipal levels, decomposing national inequality
into between-prefecture and within-prefecture inequality, and further
decomposing prefectural GE into between-municipality and within-municipality
inequality.

### [194] [Rational Miner Behaviour, Protocol Stability, and Time Preference: An Austrian and Game-Theoretic Analysis of Bitcoin's Incentive Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20965)
*Craig Steven Wright*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文结合奥地利资本理论和重复博弈理论，分析区块链系统中矿工在不同制度条件下的策略行为，指出可变协议规则会提高时间偏好，破坏长期规划和合作均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨区块链系统中矿工行为的策略性变化，特别是协议规则可变性对矿工激励和网络均衡的影响。

Method: 采用形式化的博弈论分析和奥地利经济学原理，研究可变协议如何改变矿工激励。

Result: 可变协议导致矿工从生产性投资转向政治寻租和影响力博弈，而固定协议（如比特币原始协议）能提供计算性和低时间偏好。

Conclusion: 协议不可变性对恢复战略一致性、企业家信心和可持续网络均衡至关重要。

Abstract: This paper integrates Austrian capital theory with repeated game theory to
examine strategic miner behaviour under different institutional conditions in
blockchain systems. It shows that when protocol rules are mutable, effective
time preference rises, undermining rational long-term planning and cooperative
equilibria. Using formal game-theoretic analysis and Austrian economic
principles, the paper demonstrates how mutable protocols shift miner incentives
from productive investment to political rent-seeking and influence games. The
original Bitcoin protocol is interpreted as an institutional anchor: a fixed
rule-set enabling calculability and low time preference. Drawing on the work of
Bohm-Bawerk, Mises, and Hayek, the argument is made that protocol immutability
is essential for restoring strategic coherence, entrepreneurial confidence, and
sustainable network equilibrium.

*Craig Steven Wright*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文通过博弈论模型分析区块链协议可变性对合作挖矿行为的影响，发现规则不确定性导致短期主义和策略偏离，稳定规则则支持长期合作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究区块链系统中协议可变性如何破坏合作挖矿行为，探讨规则稳定性对系统可持续性的重要性。

Method: 采用重复博弈框架和随机规则冲击模型，分析不同规则环境下的策略行为。

Result: 规则不确定性导致短期主义和策略偏离，稳定规则支持长期合作；模拟结果显示参数空间中存在不稳定区域。

Conclusion: 协议设计应被视为宪法经济约束，而非自由变量，以确保去中心化系统中的可持续合作。

Abstract: This paper develops a formal game-theoretic model to examine how protocol
mutability disrupts cooperative mining behaviour in blockchain systems. Using a
repeated game framework with stochastic rule shocks, we show that even minor
uncertainty in institutional rules increases time preference and induces
strategic deviation. Fixed-rule environments support long-term investment and
stable equilibrium strategies; in contrast, mutable protocols lead to
short-termism, higher discounting, and collapse of coordinated engagement.
Simulation results identify instability zones in the parameter space where
rational mining gives way to extractive or arbitrage conduct. These findings
support an Austrian economic interpretation: calculability requires rule
stability. Institutional noise undermines the informational basis for
productive action. We conclude that protocol design must be treated as a
constitutional economic constraint, not a discretionary variable, if
sustainable cooperation is to emerge in decentralised systems.

### [196] [Suspense and Surprise in European Football](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21253)
*Raphael Flepp,Tim Pawlowski,Travis Richardson*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究提出利用比赛悬念和惊喜作为体育赛事组织者的政策目标，通过模拟和数据分析发现，平均比赛的悬念低于基准，而惊喜值与基准一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨体育比赛中悬念和惊喜对观众娱乐效用的影响，为赛事组织者提供政策参考。

Method: 通过模拟完美平衡比赛的基准，分析欧洲顶级足球联赛的25,000多场男子比赛和725场女子比赛数据。

Result: 平均比赛的悬念低于基准，尤其是顶级球队；惊喜值与基准一致。男子足球随时间有微妙变化，男女比赛在联赛和俱乐部间存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了比赛吸引力与竞争平衡的关系，为赛事政策提供了重要启示。

Abstract: We propose utilizing match-level suspense and surprise - which capture the
entertainment utility created by competitive balance and outcome uncertainty
for sports spectators - as alternative policy targets for league organizers and
managers. Through simulations, we derive a benchmark range for suspense and
surprise based on a perfectly balanced match before analyzing over 25,000 men's
matches (2010/11-2023/24) and 725 women's matches (2023/24) from Europe's top
football leagues. Our findings reveal that an average match generates lower
suspense compared to the benchmark range, particularly for top teams, while
surprise values consistently align with the benchmark. Moreover, we observe
nuanced trends over time in men's football and highlight notable differences
across leagues and clubs in both men's and women's competitions. These insights
enhance our understanding of how the attractiveness of matches arises from
competitive balance and carry important policy implications.

### [197] [Non-Discriminatory Personalized Pricing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20925)
*Philipp Strack,Kai Hao Yang*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 论文研究了垄断者在非歧视约束下的个性化定价问题，分析了其对不同消费者群体的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在受保护特征（如种族或性别）存在差异的情况下，垄断者如何定价，并研究非歧视约束对市场结果的影响。

Method: 通过最优运输模型，刻画了最优定价规则。

Result: 研究发现，消费者可能保留剩余，且任一群体可能受益；加强约束会重新分配剩余，损害低价值群体，使高价值群体受益。

Conclusion: 非歧视约束对消费者剩余分配有显著影响，政策制定需权衡不同群体的利益。

Abstract: A monopolist offers personalized prices to consumers with unit demand,
heterogeneous values, and idiosyncratic costs, who differ in a protected
characteristic, such as race or gender. The seller is subject to a
non-discrimination constraint: consumers with the same cost, but different
characteristics must face identical prices. Such constraints arise in regulated
markets like credit or insurance. The setting reduces to an optimal transport,
and we characterize the optimal pricing rule. Under this rule, consumers may
retain surplus, and either group may benefit. Strengthening the constraint to
cover transaction prices redistributes surplus, harming the low-value group and
benefiting the high-value group.

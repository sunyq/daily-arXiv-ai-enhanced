### [1] [Rethinking the Illusion of Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01231)
*Iñaki Dellibarda Varela,Pablo Romero-Sorozabal,Eduardo Rocon,Manuel Cebrian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文澄清了关于大型推理模型（LRMs）是否具备真正推理能力的争议，通过改进实验方法，发现LRMs在特定条件下表现良好，但仍存在认知限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI社区中关于LRMs是否具备真实推理能力的争议，澄清先前研究的结论。

Method: 复制并改进原始研究中的两个争议性基准测试（Towers of Hanoi和River Crossing），引入逐步提示和协作对话方法。

Result: LRMs在复杂任务（如8个圆盘的Towers of Hanoi）中表现受限，但在可解问题（如River Crossing）中表现优异。

Conclusion: LRMs是离散状态空间中的随机搜索器，未来需要在符号推理和长期规划方面进一步研究。

Abstract: Earlier this year, Apple ignited controversy by publishing "The Illusion of
Thinking," prompting heated debate within the AI community. Critics seized upon
the findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack
genuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots.
Meanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning
the experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify
this debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most
contentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing
incremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that
previously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result
of output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs
still stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the
River Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to
hinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to
solvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100
agent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs
are stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely
understand. Real progress in symbolic, long-horizon reasoning demands mapping
that terrain through fine-grained ablations like those introduced here.

### [2] [Beyond Black-Box AI: Interpretable Hybrid Systems for Dementia Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01282)
*Matthew JY Kang,Wenli Yang,Monica R Roberts,Byeong Ho Kang,Charles B Malpas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在医疗诊断中的局限性，特别是在痴呆症诊断和护理中，并提出了结合统计学习和专家知识的混合方法以提升透明度和临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在基准测试中表现优异，但在实际临床环境中未能显著提升诊断效果，因此需要探索其局限性并提出改进方向。

Method: 通过范围综述，分析了LLMs在临床中的局限性，并提出了结合统计学习和专家规则的混合方法（如PEIRS和ATHENA-CDS）。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs在透明度和因果推理方面存在不足，而混合方法能更好地融入临床工作流程并提升可解释性。

Conclusion: 未来的AI决策支持应优先考虑解释性，结合神经符号或混合AI，并关注临床理解和患者结果，而非仅追求准确性。

Abstract: The recent boom of large language models (LLMs) has re-ignited the hope that
artificial intelligence (AI) systems could aid medical diagnosis. Yet despite
dazzling benchmark scores, LLM assistants have yet to deliver measurable
improvements at the bedside. This scoping review aims to highlight the areas
where AI is limited to make practical contributions in the clinical setting,
specifically in dementia diagnosis and care.
  Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but seldom
provide actionable, interpretable guidance, eroding clinician trust. Adjacent
use of LLMs by physicians did not result in better diagnostic accuracy or
speed. Key limitations trace to the data-driven paradigm: black-box outputs
which lack transparency, vulnerability to hallucinations, and weak causal
reasoning. Hybrid approaches that combine statistical learning with expert
rule-based knowledge, and involve clinicians throughout the process help bring
back interpretability. They also fit better with existing clinical workflows,
as seen in examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS.
  Future decision-support should prioritise explanatory coherence by linking
predictions to clinically meaningful causes. This can be done through
neuro-symbolic or hybrid AI that combines the language ability of LLMs with
human causal expertise. AI researchers have addressed this direction, with
explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI being the next logical steps in further
advancement in AI. However, they are still based on data-driven knowledge
integration instead of human-in-the-loop approaches. Future research should
measure success not only by accuracy but by improvements in clinician
understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes. A better understanding of
what helps improve human-computer interactions is greatly needed for AI systems
to become part of clinical practice.

Abstract: AI agents are autonomous systems designed to perceive, reason, and act within
dynamic environments. With the rapid advancements in generative AI (GenAI),
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved AI agents' capabilities in semantic comprehension,
complex reasoning, and autonomous decision-making. At the same time, the rise
of Agentic AI highlights adaptability and goal-directed autonomy in dynamic and
complex environments. LLMs-based AI Agents (LLM-Agents), MLLMs-based AI Agents
(MLLM-Agents), and Agentic AI contribute to expanding AI's capabilities in
information processing, environmental perception, and autonomous
decision-making, opening new avenues for smart manufacturing. However, the
definitions, capability boundaries, and practical applications of these
emerging AI paradigms in smart manufacturing remain unclear. To address this
gap, this study systematically reviews the evolution of AI and AI agent
technologies, examines the core concepts and technological advancements of
LLM-Agents, MLLM-Agents, and Agentic AI, and explores their potential
applications in and integration into manufacturing, along with the potential
challenges they may face.

Abstract: Grading handwritten, open-ended responses remains a major bottleneck in large
university STEM courses. We introduce Pensieve (https://www.pensieve.co), an
AI-assisted grading platform that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
transcribe and evaluate student work, providing instructors with rubric-aligned
scores, transcriptions, and confidence ratings. Unlike prior tools that focus
narrowly on specific tasks like transcription or rubric generation, Pensieve
supports the entire grading pipeline-from scanned student submissions to final
feedback-within a human-in-the-loop interface.
  Pensieve has been deployed in real-world courses at over 20 institutions and
has graded more than 300,000 student responses. We present system details and
empirical results across four core STEM disciplines: Computer Science,
Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. Our findings show that Pensieve reduces
grading time by an average of 65%, while maintaining a 95.4% agreement rate
with instructor-assigned grades for high-confidence predictions.

adopting emerging technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs) is becoming
a necessity to achieve these goals, the risk of hallucination remains a major
challenge. In this paper, we present a multi-agent system to handle customer
requests sent via SMS. This system integrates LLM based agents with fuzzy logic
to mitigate hallucination risks.

### [7] [Agent-as-Tool: A Study on the Hierarchical Decision Making with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01489)
*Yanfei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层框架Agent-as-tool，将工具调用与推理过程分离，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法同时处理工具调用和推理过程，导致模型负担过重，影响推理能力。

Method: 采用分层框架，分离工具调用与推理过程，由不同代理处理。

Result: 在少量样本微调后，性能显著提升，Bamboogle任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Agent-as-tool框架有效减轻模型负担，提升推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most significant
technological advancements in artificial intelligence in recent years. Their
ability to understand, generate, and reason with natural language has
transformed how we interact with AI systems. With the development of LLM-based
agents and reinforcement-learning-based reasoning models, the study of applying
reinforcement learning in agent frameworks has become a new research focus.
However, all previous studies face the challenge of deciding the tool calling
process and the reasoning process simultaneously, and the chain of reasoning
was solely relied on the unprocessed raw result with redundant information and
symbols unrelated to the task from the tool, which impose a heavy burden on the
model's capability to reason. Therefore, in our research, we proposed a
hierarchical framework Agent-as-tool that detach the tool calling process and
the reasoning process, which enables the model to focus on the verbally
reasoning process while the tool calling process is handled by another agent.
Our work had achieved comparable results with only a slight reinforcement
fine-tuning on 180 samples, and had achieved exceptionally well performance in
Bamboogle with 63.2% of exact match and 75.2% in cover exact match, exceeding
Search-R1 by 4.8% in exact match and 3.2% in cover exact match.

### [8] [T3DM: Test-Time Training-Guided Distribution Shift Modelling for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01597)
*Yuehang Si,Zefan Zeng,Jincai Huang,Qing Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的分布特征建模方法T3DM，用于解决TKG推理中的分布偏移和负采样质量问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TKG推理方法在建模训练与测试样本间的分布偏移和生成高质量负样本方面存在不足。

Method: 提出T3DM方法，通过测试时训练指导分布偏移建模，并设计基于对抗训练的负采样策略。

Result: 实验表明T3DM在多数情况下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: T3DM能有效解决分布偏移和负采样问题，提升TKG推理的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an efficient method for describing the
dynamic development of facts along a timeline. Most research on TKG reasoning
(TKGR) focuses on modelling the repetition of global facts and designing
patterns of local historical facts. However, they face two significant
challenges: inadequate modeling of the event distribution shift between
training and test samples, and reliance on random entity substitution for
generating negative samples, which often results in low-quality sampling. To
this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for
training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling
(T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global
consistency of model reasoning. In addition, we design a negative-sampling
strategy to generate higher-quality negative quadruples based on adversarial
training. Extensive experiments show that T3DM provides better and more robust
results than the state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.

Method: 设计Agent Ideate框架，结合开源LLMs和代理架构，在计算机科学、自然语言处理和材料化学领域进行实验。

Result: 代理方法在创意质量、相关性和新颖性上均优于独立LLMs。

Conclusion: LLMs与代理工作流结合可显著提升从专利数据生成商业创意的潜力。

Abstract: Patents contain rich technical knowledge that can inspire innovative product
ideas, yet accessing and interpreting this information remains a challenge.
This work explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to mine and generate product concepts from a given patent. In this work,
we design Agent Ideate, a framework for automatically generating product-based
business ideas from patents. We experimented with open-source LLMs and
agent-based architectures across three domains: Computer Science, Natural
Language Processing, and Material Chemistry. Evaluation results show that the
agentic approach consistently outperformed standalone LLMs in terms of idea
quality, relevance, and novelty. These findings suggest that combining LLMs
with agentic workflows can significantly enhance the innovation pipeline by
unlocking the untapped potential of business idea generation from patent data.

### [10] [Joint Matching and Pricing for Crowd-shipping with In-store Customers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01749)
*Arash Dehghan,Mucahit Cevik,Merve Bodur,Bissan Ghaddar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了利用店内顾客作为配送员的集中式众包配送系统，提出了一种结合NeurADP和DDQN的优化策略，显著降低了配送成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对城市地区最后一公里配送效率的需求增长，探索利用现有顾客资源进行配送的可能性。

Method: 采用马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）模型，结合NeurADP和DDQN进行订单分配和动态定价的联合优化。

Result: 实验显示，该策略比固定定价的NeurADP节省6.7%成本，比短视基线节省约18%，灵活配送和多目的地路由进一步降低成本。

Conclusion: 动态前瞻性策略在众包配送系统中具有显著优势，为城市物流运营商提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This paper examines the use of in-store customers as delivery couriers in a
centralized crowd-shipping system, targeting the growing need for efficient
last-mile delivery in urban areas. We consider a brick-and-mortar retail
setting where shoppers are offered compensation to deliver time-sensitive
online orders. To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival
of orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery
offers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming
(NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network
(DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop
routing and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely
with real-world operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the
integrated NeurADP + DDQN policy achieves notable improvements in delivery cost
efficiency, with up to 6.7\% savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and
approximately 18\% over myopic baselines. We also show that allowing flexible
delivery delays and enabling multi-destination routing further reduces
operational costs by 8\% and 17\%, respectively. These findings underscore the
advantages of dynamic, forward-looking policies in crowd-shipping systems and
offer practical guidance for urban logistics operators.

### [11] [Refining Gelfond Rationality Principle Towards More Comprehensive Foundational Principles for Answer Set Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01833)
*Yi-Dong Shen,Thomas Eiter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了非单调逻辑编程中答案集语义的一般原则，质疑了现有条件（如最小模型属性、约束单调性和基础性）的普适性，并提出了基于Gelfond答案集原则的改进方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨现有答案集语义的普适性条件是否过于严格，以及是否需要更一般的原则来指导答案集语义的设计。

Method: 方法包括：1）通过例子说明现有条件的局限性；2）改进Gelfond答案集原则，提出基于良好支持性和两种最小性的新原则；3）定义新的答案集语义；4）用新原则评估现有语义；5）分析计算复杂性。

Result: 结果表明，现有条件有时过于严格，改进后的GAS原则能更合理地定义答案集语义，并提供了新的语义定义和评估框架。

Conclusion: 结论是改进后的GAS原则为答案集语义提供了更灵活和合理的基础，同时为现有语义的评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem
solving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the
seminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic
programs, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We
consider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,
constraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be
mandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what
other properties could be considered as general principles for answer set
semantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three
aforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with
examples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we
evolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by
refining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality
w.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The
principle of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is
constructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of
circular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the
formalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world
views. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of
well-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.
Fourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS
principles. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline
to intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze
the computational complexity.

### [12] [MALIBU Benchmark: Multi-Agent LLM Implicit Bias Uncovered](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01019)
*Imran Mirza,Cole Huang,Ishwara Vasista,Rohan Patil,Asli Akalin,Sean O'Brien,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MALIBU是一个新基准，用于评估基于LLM的多智能体系统中隐含的社会偏见和刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统可能强化LLM中的隐性偏见，引发公平性和代表性担忧。

Method: 通过场景化评估，分两阶段由LLM多智能体评判系统打分，量化偏见。

Result: 研究发现偏见缓解可能偏向边缘化群体，而非真正中立。

Conclusion: 需更细致的检测、平衡的公平策略和透明评估基准。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems, which consist of multiple AI models interacting within a
shared environment, are increasingly used for persona-based interactions.
However, if not carefully designed, these systems can reinforce implicit biases
in large language models (LLMs), raising concerns about fairness and equitable
representation. We present MALIBU, a novel benchmark developed to assess the
degree to which LLM-based multi-agent systems implicitly reinforce social
biases and stereotypes. MALIBU evaluates bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems
through scenario-based assessments. AI models complete tasks within predefined
contexts, and their responses undergo evaluation by an LLM-based multi-agent
judging system in two phases. In the first phase, judges score responses
labeled with specific demographic personas (e.g., gender, race, religion)
across four metrics. In the second phase, judges compare paired responses
assigned to different personas, scoring them and selecting the superior
response. Our study quantifies biases in LLM-generated outputs, revealing that
bias mitigation may favor marginalized personas over true neutrality,
emphasizing the need for nuanced detection, balanced fairness strategies, and
transparent evaluation benchmarks in multi-agent systems.

*Huiling You,Samia Touileb,Erik Velldal,Lilja Øvrelid*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件重叠的方法来评估生成式摘要的质量，通过比较生成摘要、参考摘要和原文中的事件信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估生成式摘要的方法主要依赖人工参考摘要的相似性计算，缺乏对事件信息的直接衡量。

Method: 通过计算生成摘要、参考摘要和原文之间的事件重叠来评估摘要质量，实验基于挪威语数据集。

Result: 该方法能更深入地分析摘要中包含的事件信息。

Conclusion: 基于事件重叠的评估方法为摘要质量提供了新的视角。

Abstract: An abstractive summary of a news article contains its most important
information in a condensed version. The evaluation of automatically generated
summaries by generative language models relies heavily on human-authored
summaries as gold references, by calculating overlapping units or similarity
scores. News articles report events, and ideally so should the summaries. In
this work, we propose to evaluate the quality of abstractive summaries by
calculating overlapping events between generated summaries, reference
summaries, and the original news articles. We experiment on a richly annotated
Norwegian dataset comprising both events annotations and summaries authored by
expert human annotators. Our approach provides more insight into the event
information contained in the summaries.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了瑞典百科全书《Nordisk familjebok》第一版和第二版中地理条目的变化，发现从欧洲向北美、非洲、亚洲、澳大利亚和北欧的显著转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是通过数字化版本分析百科全书条目内容的变化，反映19世纪末至20世纪初瑞典社会的知识变迁。

Method: 使用语义句子嵌入匹配条目，基于Transformer的分类器提取地理条目并链接到Wikidata，分析地理趋势变化。

Result: 发现从第一版到第二版，地理焦点从欧洲显著转向北美、非洲、亚洲、澳大利亚和北欧。

Conclusion: 这种变化反映了第一次世界大战和新势力崛起的影响，验证了百科全书内容与社会变迁的关联。

Abstract: The \textit{Nordisk familjebok} is a Swedish encyclopedia from the 19th and
20th centuries. It was written by a team of experts and aimed to be an
intellectual reference, stressing precision and accuracy. This encyclopedia had
four main editions remarkable by their size, ranging from 20 to 38 volumes. As
a consequence, the \textit{Nordisk familjebok} had a considerable influence in
universities, schools, the media, and society overall. As new editions were
released, the selection of entries and their content evolved, reflecting
intellectual changes in Sweden.
  In this paper, we used digitized versions from \textit{Project Runeberg}. We
first resegmented the raw text into entries and matched pairs of entries
between the first and second editions using semantic sentence embeddings. We
then extracted the geographical entries from both editions using a
transformer-based classifier and linked them to Wikidata. This enabled us to
identify geographic trends and possible shifts between the first and second
editions, written between 1876-1899 and 1904-1926, respectively.
  Interpreting the results, we observe a small but significant shift in
geographic focus away from Europe and towards North America, Africa, Asia,
Australia, and northern Scandinavia from the first to the second edition,
confirming the influence of the First World War and the rise of new powers. The
code and data are available on GitHub at

### [15] [MEGA: xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion for Precise Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01213)
*Adamu Lawan,Juhua Pu,Haruna Yunusa,Jawad Muhammad,Muhammad Lawan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MEGA的新框架，结合双向mLSTM和部分翻转反向流（PF-mLSTM），通过多头指数门控融合机制（MECGAF）优化ABSA任务中的局部和全局依赖建模，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ABSA方法在计算效率与高性能之间难以平衡，如深度学习模型缺乏全局上下文，Transformer计算资源需求高，而Mamba方法存在CUDA依赖和局部相关性不足的问题。xLSTM在长程依赖建模上的潜力尚未在ABSA中充分挖掘。

Method: 提出xLSTM与多头部指数门控融合（MEGA）框架，结合双向mLSTM和PF-mLSTM流，通过MECGAF机制动态融合前向和反向流输出，优化局部依赖捕获并保持全局上下文。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，MEGA在ABSA任务中优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: MEGA框架通过创新的双向流设计和融合机制，有效解决了ABSA任务中的局部与全局依赖建模问题，为ABSA研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a critical Natural Language
Processing (NLP) task that extracts aspects from text and determines their
associated sentiments, enabling fine-grained analysis of user opinions.
Existing ABSA methods struggle to balance computational efficiency with high
performance: deep learning models often lack global context, transformers
demand significant computational resources, and Mamba-based approaches face
CUDA dependency and diminished local correlations. Recent advancements in
Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) models, particularly their efficient
modeling of long-range dependencies, have significantly advanced the NLP
community. However, their potential in ABSA remains untapped. To this end, we
propose xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion (MEGA), a novel framework
integrating a bi-directional mLSTM architecture with forward and partially
flipped backward (PF-mLSTM) streams. The PF-mLSTM enhances localized context
modeling by processing the initial sequence segment in reverse with dedicated
parameters, preserving critical short-range patterns. We further introduce an
mLSTM-based multihead cross exponential gated fusion mechanism (MECGAF) that
dynamically combines forward mLSTM outputs as query and key with PF-mLSTM
outputs as value, optimizing short-range dependency capture while maintaining
global context and efficiency. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
superior accuracy and efficiency in ABSA tasks.

Motivation: 文本序列的嵌入相似性度量可能受到无关混杂因素（如文本来源或语言）的影响，导致在多语料库应用中产生问题。

Method: 采用去偏算法，从编码器表示中移除观察到的混杂因素信息。

Result: 去偏算法显著改善了文档相似性和聚类度量，且不影响分布外基准性能。

Conclusion: 去偏算法能有效减少嵌入相似性度量中的偏差，且不损害其他性能。

Abstract: Embedding-based similarity metrics between text sequences can be influenced
not just by the content dimensions we most care about, but can also be biased
by spurious attributes like the text's source or language. These document
confounders cause problems for many applications, but especially those that
need to pool texts from different corpora. This paper shows that a debiasing
algorithm that removes information about observed confounders from the encoder
representations substantially reduces these biases at a minimal computational
cost. Document similarity and clustering metrics improve across every embedding
variant and task we evaluate -- often dramatically. Interestingly, performance
on out-of-distribution benchmarks is not impacted, indicating that the
embeddings are not otherwise degraded.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在法律信息检索中的局限性，特别是在非英语和非中文法律体系中的应用。

Method: 提出gAIus架构，基于波兰民法典知识检索，采用更可解释和人性化的检索机制。

Result: gAIus显著提升模型性能，gpt-3.5-turbo-0125改进419%，gpt-4o-mini从31%提升至86%。

Abstract: In this paper we discuss the capability of large language models to base
their answer and provide proper references when dealing with legal matters of
non-english and non-chinese speaking country. We discuss the history of legal
information retrieval, the difference between case law and statute law, its
impact on the legal tasks and analyze the latest research in this field. Basing
on that background we introduce gAIus, the architecture of the cognitive
LLM-based agent, whose responses are based on the knowledge retrieved from
certain legal act, which is Polish Civil Code. We propose a retrieval mechanism
which is more explainable, human-friendly and achieves better results than
embedding-based approaches. To evaluate our method we create special dataset
based on single-choice questions from entrance exams for law apprenticeships
conducted in Poland. The proposed architecture critically leveraged the
abilities of used large language models, improving the gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 by
419%, allowing it to beat gpt-4o and lifting gpt-4o-mini score from 31% to 86%.
At the end of our paper we show the possible future path of research and
potential applications of our findings.

TL;DR: GPT-4在眼科中模拟临床决策的能力被评估，结果显示其在糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）筛查中表现中等，但在青光眼筛查中表现较差。临床元数据的加入对结果无显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在眼科中的应用潜力，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变和青光眼的筛查中。

Method: 使用300张标注的眼底图像，通过结构化提示描述图像，评估GPT-4的分类和推荐能力，并分析元数据的影响。

Result: GPT-4在DR筛查中表现中等（准确率82.3%），但在青光眼筛查中表现差（准确率约78%）。元数据对结果无显著影响。

Conclusion: GPT-4能够模拟基本的眼科决策，但不适合临床使用，可能适用于教育或文档工作。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can simulate clinical reasoning based on natural
language prompts, but their utility in ophthalmology is largely unexplored.
This study evaluated GPT-4's ability to interpret structured textual
descriptions of retinal fundus photographs and simulate clinical decisions for
diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma screening, including the impact of
adding real or synthetic clinical metadata. We conducted a retrospective
diagnostic validation study using 300 annotated fundus images. GPT-4 received
structured prompts describing each image, with or without patient metadata. The
model was tasked with assigning an ICDR severity score, recommending DR
referral, and estimating the cup-to-disc ratio for glaucoma referral.
Performance was evaluated using accuracy, macro and weighted F1 scores, and
Cohen's kappa. McNemar's test and change rate analysis were used to assess the
influence of metadata. GPT-4 showed moderate performance for ICDR
classification (accuracy 67.5%, macro F1 0.33, weighted F1 0.67, kappa 0.25),
driven mainly by correct identification of normal cases. Performance improved
in the binary DR referral task (accuracy 82.3%, F1 0.54, kappa 0.44). For
glaucoma referral, performance was poor across all settings (accuracy ~78%, F1
<0.04, kappa <0.03). Metadata inclusion did not significantly affect outcomes
(McNemar p > 0.05), and predictions remained consistent across conditions.
GPT-4 can simulate basic ophthalmic decision-making from structured prompts but
lacks precision for complex tasks. While not suitable for clinical use, LLMs
may assist in education, documentation, or image annotation workflows in
ophthalmology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中因知识冲突导致的生成不可靠问题。

Method: 提出CARE-RAG框架，包括参数感知证据、上下文感知证据、冲突驱动总结和QA修复步骤。

Result: 在噪声或冲突证据场景下，CARE-RAG表现优于现有RAG基线。

Conclusion: CARE-RAG有效提升RAG系统的可信度和生成质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating their parametric knowledge with external retrieved content.
However, knowledge conflicts caused by internal inconsistencies or noisy
retrieved content can severely undermine the generation reliability of RAG
systems.In this work, we argue that LLMs should rethink all evidence, including
both retrieved content and internal knowledge, before generating responses.We
propose CARE-RAG (Conflict-Aware and Reliable Evidence for RAG), a novel
framework that improves trustworthiness through Conflict-Driven Summarization
of all available evidence.CARE-RAG first derives parameter-aware evidence by
comparing parameter records to identify diverse internal perspectives. It then
refines retrieved evidences to produce context-aware evidence, removing
irrelevant or misleading content. To detect and summarize conflicts, we distill
a 3B LLaMA3.2 model to perform conflict-driven summarization, enabling reliable
synthesis across multiple sources.To further ensure evaluation integrity, we
introduce a QA Repair step to correct outdated or ambiguous benchmark
answers.Experiments on revised QA datasets with retrieval data show that
CARE-RAG consistently outperforms strong RAG baselines, especially in scenarios
with noisy or conflicting evidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG在推理密集型任务中表现有限，缺乏与预训练数据广度对齐的高质量数据存储。

Method: 引入CompactDS，通过过滤低质量内容并结合内存近似最近邻（ANN）检索与磁盘精确搜索，实现高效检索。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如MMLU、GPQA、MATH）中，RAG性能提升显著（10%-33%），且优于复杂代理系统。

Conclusion: CompactDS证明了高质量、多样化数据存储对RAG的重要性，同时保持了简单性和可复现性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has primarily been studied in limited
settings, such as factoid question answering; more challenging,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks have seen limited success from minimal RAG. In
this work, we challenge this prevailing view on established,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks: MMLU, MMLU Pro, AGI Eval, GPQA, and MATH. We
identify a key missing component in prior work: a usable, web-scale datastore
aligned with the breadth of pretraining data. To this end, we introduce
CompactDS: a diverse, high-quality, web-scale datastore that achieves high
retrieval accuracy and subsecond latency on a single-node. The key insights are
(1) most web content can be filtered out without sacrificing coverage, and a
compact, high-quality subset is sufficient; and (2) combining in-memory
approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) retrieval and on-disk exact search balances
speed and recall. Using CompactDS, we show that a minimal RAG pipeline achieves
consistent accuracy improvements across all benchmarks and model sizes
(8B--70B), with relative gains of 10% on MMLU, 33% on MMLU Pro, 14% on GPQA,
and 19% on MATH. No single data source suffices alone, highlighting the
importance of diversity of sources (web crawls, curated math, academic papers,
textbooks). Finally, we show that our carefully designed in-house datastore
matches or outperforms web search engines such as Google Search, as well as
recently proposed, complex agent-based RAG systems--all while maintaining
simplicity, reproducibility, and self-containment. We release CompactDS and our
retrieval pipeline, supporting future research exploring retrieval-based AI
systems.

TL;DR: LaRoSA是一种无需额外训练或基于幅值剪枝的新方法，通过层间正交旋转实现激活稀疏化，提升LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要耗时恢复训练或依赖经验性剪枝，导致稀疏性波动和推理加速不稳定。

Method: 利用层间正交旋转将输入激活转换为更适合稀疏化的形式，并采用Top-K选择实现一致的模型级稀疏性。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B上，40%稀疏性下仅0.17困惑度差距和1.30倍加速，零样本任务准确度差距仅0.54%。

Conclusion: LaRoSA在多种LLM上表现优异，稀疏化效果稳定且推理加速显著。

Abstract: Activation sparsity can reduce the computational overhead and memory
transfers during the forward pass of Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
Existing methods face limitations, either demanding time-consuming recovery
training that hinders real-world adoption, or relying on empirical
magnitude-based pruning, which causes fluctuating sparsity and unstable
inference speed-up. This paper introduces LaRoSA (Layerwise Rotated Sparse
Activation), a novel method for activation sparsification designed to improve
LLM efficiency without requiring additional training or magnitude-based
pruning. We leverage layerwise orthogonal rotations to transform input
activations into rotated forms that are more suitable for sparsification. By
employing a Top-K selection approach within the rotated activations, we achieve
consistent model-level sparsity and reliable wall-clock time speed-up. LaRoSA
is effective across various sizes and types of LLMs, demonstrating minimal
performance degradation and robust inference acceleration. Specifically, for
LLaMA2-7B at 40% sparsity, LaRoSA achieves a mere 0.17 perplexity gap with a
consistent 1.30x wall-clock time speed-up, and reduces the accuracy gap in
zero-shot tasks compared to the dense model to just 0.54%, while surpassing
TEAL by 1.77% and CATS by 17.14%.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型在捕捉人类偏好方面表现不佳，主要原因是偏好数据集范围狭窄、标注质量低或缺乏质量控制。

Method: 设计人机协同的两阶段流程，结合人类标注质量与AI扩展性，构建SynPref-40M数据集，并训练Skywork-Reward-V2模型。

Result: Skywork-Reward-V2在七个主要奖励模型基准测试中表现最优，验证了数据规模与高质量标注的重要性。

Conclusion: 人机协同的数据集构建方法显著提升了奖励模型的性能，展示了现有偏好数据集的潜力。

Abstract: Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on
most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced
and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced
training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We
hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in
preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or
lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a
large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named
SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic
two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human
annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide
verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation
based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce
Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B
parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference
pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile
across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human
preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and
best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major
reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our
approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation.
The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward
models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and
demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher
data quality.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges posed by the unstructured nature and
high-dimensional semantic complexity of electronic health record texts. A deep
learning method based on attention mechanisms is proposed to achieve unified
modeling for information extraction and multi-label disease prediction. The
study is conducted on the MIMIC-IV dataset. A Transformer-based architecture is
used to perform representation learning over clinical text. Multi-layer
self-attention mechanisms are employed to capture key medical entities and
their contextual relationships. A Sigmoid-based multi-label classifier is then
applied to predict multiple disease labels. The model incorporates a
context-aware semantic alignment mechanism, enhancing its representational
capacity in typical medical scenarios such as label co-occurrence and sparse
information. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, a series of
experiments were conducted, including baseline comparisons, hyperparameter
sensitivity analysis, data perturbation studies, and noise injection tests.
Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
representative existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. The
model maintains strong generalization under varying data scales, interference
levels, and model depth configurations. The framework developed in this study
offers an efficient algorithmic foundation for processing real-world clinical
texts and presents practical significance for multi-label medical text modeling
tasks.

TL;DR: LogitSpec是一种无需训练的检索式推测解码方法，通过利用最后一个token的logit推测后续token，显著提升LLM推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索式推测解码方法难以找到匹配的准确草案token，LogitSpec通过扩展检索范围解决这一问题。

Method: LogitSpec分两步生成草案token：1) 利用最后一个token的logit推测下一个token；2) 检索与推测token相关的参考。

Result: 实验显示，LogitSpec在文本生成任务中最高实现2.61倍加速，平均每个解码步骤接受3.28个token。

Conclusion: LogitSpec是一种即插即用的高效方法，可轻松集成到现有LLM推理框架中。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where a small draft model is employed to propose
draft tokens in advance and then the target model validates them in parallel,
has emerged as a promising technique for LLM inference acceleration. Many
endeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and
generate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate
the drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and
applications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to
retrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods
often fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this
challenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and
find the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the
observation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next
token, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec
generates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate
the next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token
and the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which
can be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive
experiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that
LogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens
per decoding step. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有LLM文本简化系统缺乏目标群体的偏好反馈，导致个性化不足。

Method: 结合监督微调（SFT）和DPO技术，利用目标群体的反馈数据优化模型。

Result: 研究表明，目标群体的参与对设计符合人类期望的个性化AI解决方案至关重要。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化包容性AI系统的发展提供了新思路，强调目标群体直接参与的重要性。

Abstract: Automatic text simplification (ATS) aims to enhance language accessibility
for various target groups, particularly persons with intellectual disabilities.
Recent advancements in generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs),
have substantially improved the quality of machine-generated text
simplifications, thereby mitigating information barriers for the target group.
However, existing LLM-based ATS systems do not incorporate preference feedback
on text simplifications during training, resulting in a lack of personalization
tailored to the specific needs of target group representatives.
  In this work, we extend the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach
for adapting LLM-based ATS models by leveraging a computationally efficient LLM
alignment technique -- direct preference optimization (DPO). Specifically, we
post-train LLM-based ATS models using human feedback collected from persons
with intellectual disabilities, reflecting their preferences on paired text
simplifications generated by mainstream LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a
pipeline for developing personalized LLM-based ATS systems, encompassing data
collection, model selection, SFT and DPO post-training, and evaluation. Our
findings underscore the necessity of active participation of target group
persons in designing personalized AI accessibility solutions aligned with human
expectations. This work represents a step towards personalizing inclusive AI
systems at the target-group level, incorporating insights not only from text
simplification experts but also from target group persons themselves.

Motivation: 任务导向对话系统（TODS）需要处理未见过或模糊的查询，确保系统的鲁棒性。

Method: 首先对已部署的意图分类器进行不确定性估计，然后对高不确定性实例触发微调的LLM进行最终决策。

Result: 在关键OOS检测基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，包括从实际部署的TODS中获取的真实OOS数据。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和性能之间取得了平衡，结合传统方法和LLM，显著提升了OOS检测能力。

Abstract: Out-of-scope (OOS) intent detection is a critical challenge in task-oriented
dialogue systems (TODS), as it ensures robustness to unseen and ambiguous
queries. In this work, we propose a novel but simple modular framework that
combines uncertainty modeling with fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for
efficient and accurate OOS detection. The first step applies uncertainty
estimation to the output of an in-scope intent detection classifier, which is
currently deployed in a real-world TODS handling tens of thousands of user
interactions daily. The second step then leverages an emerging LLM-based
approach, where a fine-tuned LLM is triggered to make a final decision on
instances with high uncertainty. Unlike prior approaches, our method
effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, combining
traditional approaches with LLMs and yielding state-of-the-art results on key
OOS detection benchmarks, including real-world OOS data acquired from a
deployed TODS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨外部信息是否能够提升LLM在立场检测任务中的表现，尽管此前研究表明其对BERT等模型有益。

Method: 系统评估了八种LLM在三个数据集和12个目标上的表现，分析了外部信息的影响。

Result: 外部信息通常导致性能下降，LLM倾向于与提供的信息的立场和情感对齐，而非文本的真实立场。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在立场检测中的信息偏见风险，与BERT模型的结果形成对比。

Abstract: In the stance detection task, a text is classified as either favorable,
opposing, or neutral towards a target. Prior work suggests that the use of
external information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection
performance. However, whether or not such information can benefit large
language models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide
adoption in many reasoning tasks. In this study, we conduct a systematic
evaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect
stance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.
Surprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,
with macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\%. We explain this through
experiments showing LLMs' tendency to align their predictions with the stance
and sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance
of the given text. We also find that performance degradation persists with
chain-of-thought prompting, while fine-tuning mitigates but does not fully
eliminate it. Our findings, in contrast to previous literature on BERT-based
systems which suggests that external information enhances performance,
highlight the risks of information biases in LLM-based stance classifiers. Code

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are designed to help users achieve
specific goals through natural language interaction. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved linguistic fluency and
contextual understanding, building effective and emotionally intelligent ToD
systems remains a complex challenge. Effective ToD systems must optimise for
task success, emotional understanding and responsiveness, and precise
information conveyance, all within inherently noisy and ambiguous
conversational environments. In this work, we investigate architectural,
representational, optimisational as well as emotional considerations of ToD
systems. We set up systems covering these design considerations with a
challenging evaluation environment composed of a natural-language user

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文比较了全局评分和成对比较在NLP模型评估中的优缺点，发现全局评分更可靠但可能低估某些模型，而成对比较能更好识别低分模型中的强者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着指令调优神经语言模型的发展，NLP评估从传统全局评分转向成对比较排行榜，需研究两者的优劣以指导评估策略选择。

Method: 通过合成和真实数据集的计算实验，使用标准全局指标和Bradley-Terry模型进行成对比较。

Result: 全局评分提供更可靠的总体排名，但可能低估某些模型；成对比较能识别低分模型中的强者，但收敛较慢。

Conclusion: 选择评估策略需权衡全局评分的可靠性和成对比较的灵活性，尤其在不明确质量指标时。

Abstract: With the advent of highly capable instruction-tuned neural language models,
benchmarking in natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly shifting
towards pairwise comparison leaderboards, such as LMSYS Arena, from traditional
global pointwise scores (e.g., GLUE, BIG-bench, SWE-bench). This paper
empirically investigates the strengths and weaknesses of both global scores and
pairwise comparisons to aid decision-making in selecting appropriate model
evaluation strategies. Through computational experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets using standard global metrics and the popular Bradley-Terry
model for pairwise comparisons, we found that while global scores provide more
reliable overall rankings, they can underestimate strong models with rare,
significant errors or low confidence. Conversely, pairwise comparisons are
particularly effective for identifying strong contenders among models with
lower global scores, especially where quality metrics are hard to define (e.g.,
text generation), though they require more comparisons to converge if ties are
frequent. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: 研究了预训练语言模型在低资源印尼本地语言情感分析任务中的迁移能力，评估了零样本和适配器迁移方法，发现MAD-X适配器显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练语言模型在低资源印尼本地语言中的迁移效果，以解决资源匮乏问题。

Method: 使用印尼BERT、mBERT、XLM-R和MAD-X适配器，将目标语言分为三类（已见、部分见、未见）进行评估。

Result: 多语言模型在已见语言表现最佳，MAD-X适配器显著提升性能；语言暴露是迁移成功的关键因素。

Conclusion: 模型对语言的先验暴露是迁移成功的主要预测因素，适配器方法对低资源语言有效。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transferability of pre-trained language
models to low-resource Indonesian local languages through the task of sentiment
analysis. We evaluate both zero-shot performance and adapter-based transfer on
ten local languages using models of different types: a monolingual Indonesian
BERT, multilingual models such as mBERT and XLM-R, and a modular adapter-based
approach called MAD-X. To better understand model behavior, we group the target
languages into three categories: seen (included during pre-training), partially
seen (not included but linguistically related to seen languages), and unseen
(absent and unrelated in pre-training data). Our results reveal clear
performance disparities across these groups: multilingual models perform best
on seen languages, moderately on partially seen ones, and poorly on unseen
languages. We find that MAD-X significantly improves performance, especially
for seen and partially seen languages, without requiring labeled data in the
target language. Additionally, we conduct a further analysis on tokenization
and show that while subword fragmentation and vocabulary overlap with
Indonesian correlate weakly with prediction quality, they do not fully explain
the observed performance. Instead, the most consistent predictor of transfer
success is the model's prior exposure to the language, either directly or
through a related language.

TL;DR: 提出AdamMeme框架，动态评估多模态大语言模型对有害模因的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法基于静态数据集，无法适应动态演变的在线模因，需更灵活的评估框架。

Method: 采用多智能体协作的AdamMeme框架，动态更新模因数据以测试模型推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能系统揭示不同模型的性能差异及弱点。

Conclusion: AdamMeme为评估多模态大语言模型的有害模因理解能力提供了动态、全面的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal memes in the social media era demands that
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) effectively understand meme
harmfulness. Existing benchmarks for assessing mLLMs on harmful meme
understanding rely on accuracy-based, model-agnostic evaluations using static
datasets. These benchmarks are limited in their ability to provide up-to-date
and thorough assessments, as online memes evolve dynamically. To address this,
we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that
adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme
harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive
evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples,
thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness.
Extensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the
varying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained
analyses of model-specific weaknesses. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出StereoBias数据集，通过联合学习偏见和刻板印象检测任务提升模型性能，实验表明联合训练显著优于单独训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型中的偏见和刻板印象可能造成危害，尤其在敏感领域如内容审核和决策中，需有效检测和缓解。

Method: 引入StereoBias数据集，涵盖五类偏见和刻板印象；比较编码器模型与微调解码器模型（QLoRA），并实验联合训练与单独训练的效果。

Result: 联合训练显著提升偏见检测性能，且改进源于偏见与刻板印象的关联，而非多任务学习本身。

Conclusion: 利用刻板印象信息可构建更公平有效的AI系统。

Abstract: Bias and stereotypes in language models can cause harm, especially in
sensitive areas like content moderation and decision-making. This paper
addresses bias and stereotype detection by exploring how jointly learning these
tasks enhances model performance. We introduce StereoBias, a unique dataset
labeled for bias and stereotype detection across five categories: religion,
gender, socio-economic status, race, profession, and others, enabling a deeper
study of their relationship. Our experiments compare encoder-only models and
fine-tuned decoder-only models using QLoRA. While encoder-only models perform
well, decoder-only models also show competitive results. Crucially, joint
training on bias and stereotype detection significantly improves bias detection
compared to training them separately. Additional experiments with sentiment
analysis confirm that the improvements stem from the connection between bias
and stereotypes, not multi-task learning alone. These findings highlight the
value of leveraging stereotype information to build fairer and more effective
AI systems.

*Oliver Wardas,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了NLP在法律文本分析中的应用，特别是LLMs在德国雇佣合同条款合法性分类中的表现。研究发现，法律上下文（如全文法律文本和考试指南）对模型性能有显著影响，但LLMs的表现仍远低于律师。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律工作的文本密集性和资源密集性为NLP研究提供了独特挑战和机会。数据驱动方法缺乏可解释性和可信度，限制了其在动态法律环境中的应用。

Method: 与法律专家合作扩展数据集，探索LLMs和上下文学习在德国雇佣合同条款合法性分类中的应用，评估三种法律上下文变体（无上下文、全文法律文本、考试指南）的影响。

Result: 全文法律文本略微提升性能，考试指南显著提高无效条款的召回率和加权F1-Score（达80%），但LLMs表现仍远低于律师。

Conclusion: LLMs在合同合法性审查中具有辅助潜力，但现有方法仍有局限性。研究贡献了扩展数据集和代码，为未来研究提供资源。

Abstract: Legal work, characterized by its text-heavy and resource-intensive nature,
presents unique challenges and opportunities for NLP research. While
data-driven approaches have advanced the field, their lack of interpretability
and trustworthiness limits their applicability in dynamic legal environments.
To address these issues, we collaborated with legal experts to extend an
existing dataset and explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
in-context learning to evaluate the legality of clauses in German employment
contracts. Our work evaluates the ability of different LLMs to classify clauses
as "valid," "unfair," or "void" under three legal context variants: no legal
context, full-text sources of laws and court rulings, and distilled versions of
these (referred to as examination guidelines). Results show that full-text
sources moderately improve performance, while examination guidelines
significantly enhance recall for void clauses and weighted F1-Score, reaching
80\%. Despite these advancements, LLMs' performance when using full-text
sources remains substantially below that of human lawyers. We contribute an
extended dataset, including examination guidelines, referenced legal sources,
and corresponding annotations, alongside our code and all log files. Our
findings highlight the potential of LLMs to assist lawyers in contract legality
review while also underscoring the limitations of the methods presented.

Motivation: 分词是语料库语言学的基础步骤，但表情符号和同形异义词的分词差异会影响数据的表示和分析的可靠性。

Method: 研究提出了预处理表情符号和同形异义词的方法，以确保数字文本在语料库中的准确表示。

Result: 研究强调了理解语言和技术细节对提高语料库分析准确性的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究对定量和定性的语料库研究方法具有重要启示，强调了预处理对数据可靠性和分析可重复性的必要性。

Abstract: Tokenisation - "the process of splitting text into atomic parts" (Brezina &
Timperley, 2017: 1) - is a crucial step for corpus linguistics, as it provides
the basis for any applicable quantitative method (e.g. collocations) while
ensuring the reliability of qualitative approaches. This paper examines how
discrepancies in tokenisation affect the representation of language data and
the validity of analytical findings: investigating the challenges posed by
emojis and homoglyphs, the study highlights the necessity of preprocessing
these elements to maintain corpus fidelity to the source data. The research
presents methods for ensuring that digital texts are accurately represented in
corpora, thereby supporting reliable linguistic analysis and guaranteeing the
repeatability of linguistic interpretations. The findings emphasise the
necessity of a detailed understanding of both linguistic and technical aspects
involved in digital textual data to enhance the accuracy of corpus analysis,
and have significant implications for both quantitative and qualitative
approaches in corpus-based research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于模型的数据选择方法主要关注英语，而数据质量对多语言大模型性能至关重要。

Method: MuRating通过聚合多个英语评分器的信号，学习统一的文档质量分数，并通过翻译训练多语言评估器。

Result: MuRating在英语和多语言基准测试中均显著提升模型性能，尤其在知识密集型任务上表现突出。

Conclusion: MuRating为多语言数据选择提供了有效方法，并指出了未来在翻译保真度和叙事材料不足等方面的研究方向。

Abstract: Data quality is a critical driver of large language model performance, yet
existing model-based selection methods focus almost exclusively on English. We
introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English
data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating
aggregates multiple English "raters" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified
document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to
train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text
pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and
multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to
strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach
boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual
evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We
further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation
of narrative material, outlining directions for future work.

Method: 使用线性探针分析Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct模型，区分评估与部署提示。

Result: 模型能区分评估与部署提示，且当前安全评估被模型视为不真实。

Conclusion: 需确保评估的可信度，理解模型的欺骗能力，未来可结合模型内部机制提升安全审计效果。

Abstract: Language models can distinguish between testing and deployment phases -- a
capability known as evaluation awareness. This has significant safety and
policy implications, potentially undermining the reliability of evaluations
that are central to AI governance frameworks and voluntary industry
commitments. In this paper, we study evaluation awareness in
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We show that linear probes can separate real-world
evaluation and deployment prompts, suggesting that current models internally
represent this distinction. We also find that current safety evaluations are
correctly classified by the probes, suggesting that they already appear
artificial or inauthentic to models. Our findings underscore the importance of
ensuring trustworthy evaluations and understanding deceptive capabilities. More
broadly, our work showcases how model internals may be leveraged to support
blackbox methods in safety audits, especially for future models more competent
at evaluation awareness and deception.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多模态模型在输入信息冲突时的行为，揭示其内部机制如何影响模态偏好。

Method: 通过向视觉-语言模型提供不一致输入（如图片与标题不符），观察模型对不同模态的响应，并分析其内部结构和注意力机制。

Result: 模型倾向于优先处理某一模态，且内部结构和注意力机制影响其偏好；发现模态无关的“路由头”可优化性能。

Conclusion: 研究为识别和控制多模态模型在复杂环境中的冲突信号处理提供了关键步骤。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly required to be multimodal, integrating disparate
input streams into a coherent state representation on which subsequent
behaviors and actions can be based. This paper seeks to understand how such
models behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing
specifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g.,
an image of a dog paired with the caption "A photo of a cat") and ask the model
to report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g.,
"What does the caption say / What is in the image?"). We find that models often
favor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what
the caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they
favor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in
the internal representational structure of the model, and that specific
attention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over
the other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic "router heads" which appear to
promote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can
be manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets
and modalities. Together, the work provides essential steps towards identifying
and controlling if and how models detect and resolve conflicting signals within
complex multimodal environments.

Motivation: 自动医疗编码可简化文档和计费流程，但缺乏透明性评估数据，MDACE数据集为此提供了资源。

Method: 深入分析MDACE数据集，评估现有可解释医疗编码系统的合理性，提出匹配度量并分析案例。

Result: 真实证据与代码描述部分吻合，先进方法与真实证据高度重叠。

Conclusion: 基于发现，提出了开发和评估可解释医疗编码系统的建议。

Abstract: Automatic medical coding has the potential to ease documentation and billing
processes. For this task, transparency plays an important role for medical
coders and regulatory bodies, which can be achieved using explainability
methods. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been mostly limited to
short text and binary settings due to a scarcity of annotated data. Recent
efforts by Cheng et al. (2023) have introduced the MDACE dataset, which
provides a valuable resource containing code evidence in clinical records. In
this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the MDACE dataset and perform
plausibility evaluation of current explainable medical coding systems from an
applied perspective. With this, we contribute to a deeper understanding of
automatic medical coding and evidence extraction. Our findings reveal that
ground truth evidence aligns with code descriptions to a certain degree. An
investigation into state-of-the-art approaches shows a high overlap with ground
truth evidence. We propose match measures and highlight success and failure
cases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for developing and
evaluating explainable medical coding systems.

Method: 评估三种序列化格式的解析性，分析提示优化和模型大小对结构稳健性的影响，并进行错误模式分析。

Result: JSON解析性最高，结构稳健性随提示优化和模型增大而提升，但长文档和特定笔记类型会降低效果。

Conclusion: JSON是临床笔记属性-值提取的最佳选择，提示设计和模型大小需根据文档长度和类型调整。

Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the parseability of structured outputs
generated by small language models for open attribute-value extraction from
clinical notes. We evaluate three widely used serialization formats: JSON,
YAML, and XML, and find that JSON consistently yields the highest parseability.
Structural robustness improves with targeted prompting and larger models, but
declines for longer documents and certain note types. Our error analysis
identifies recurring format-specific failure patterns. These findings offer
practical guidance for selecting serialization formats and designing prompts

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，理解训练数据如何影响其输出对透明度、问责制、隐私和公平性至关重要。

Method: 通过分析低困惑度序列（模型生成的高概率文本片段），构建了一个可靠的流程来提取这些序列并将其追溯到训练数据中的来源。

Result: 研究发现，大量低困惑度序列无法映射到训练语料中；对于能匹配的序列，量化了其在源文档中的分布，揭示了逐字复现的范围和性质。

Conclusion: 研究为理解训练数据如何影响LLMs行为提供了新视角，并强调了进一步探索的必要性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly widespread, understanding
how specific training data shapes their outputs is crucial for transparency,
accountability, privacy, and fairness. To explore how LLMs leverage and
replicate their training data, we introduce a systematic approach centered on
analyzing low-perplexity sequences - high-probability text spans generated by
the model. Our pipeline reliably extracts such long sequences across diverse
topics while avoiding degeneration, then traces them back to their sources in
the training data. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial portion of these
low-perplexity spans cannot be mapped to the corpus. For those that do match,
we quantify the distribution of occurrences across source documents,
highlighting the scope and nature of verbatim recall and paving a way toward
better understanding of how LLMs training data impacts their behavior.

Result: 评估显示词汇扩展可靠且公平，生成的测验高度准确。

Conclusion: DIY-MKG是一个有效的多语言学习工具，解决了现有工具的局限性。

Abstract: Existing language learning tools, even those powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs), often lack support for polyglot learners to build linguistic
connections across vocabularies in multiple languages, provide limited
customization for individual learning paces or needs, and suffer from
detrimental cognitive offloading. To address these limitations, we design
Do-It-Yourself Multilingual Knowledge Graph (DIY-MKG), an open-source system
that supports polyglot language learning. DIY-MKG allows the user to build
personalized vocabulary knowledge graphs, which are constructed by selective
expansion with related words suggested by an LLM. The system further enhances
learning through rich annotation capabilities and an adaptive review module
that leverages LLMs for dynamic, personalized quiz generation. In addition,
DIY-MKG allows users to flag incorrect quiz questions, simultaneously
increasing user engagement and providing a feedback loop for prompt refinement.
Our evaluation of LLM-based components in DIY-MKG shows that vocabulary
expansion is reliable and fair across multiple languages, and that the
generated quizzes are highly accurate, validating the robustness of DIY-MKG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小语言模型（SLMs）在长链推理任务中的学习能力不足问题。

Method: 使用中间模型作为教师助手，利用中间长度推理序列填补能力和推理长度差距。

Result: Qwen2.5-7B和Qwen2.5-3B模型在多个基准测试中平均得分显著提升。

Conclusion: MiCoTA为小语言模型的长链推理数据蒸馏提供了有效方法，并为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks requiring long thought
sequences for planning, reflection, and refinement. However, their substantial
model size and high computational demands are impractical for widespread
deployment. Yet, small language models (SLMs) often struggle to learn long-form
CoT reasoning due to their limited capacity, a phenomenon we refer to as the
"SLMs Learnability Gap". To address this, we introduce
\textbf{Mi}d-\textbf{Co}T \textbf{T}eacher \textbf{A}ssistant Distillation
(MiCoTAl), a framework for improving long CoT distillation for SLMs. MiCoTA
employs intermediate-sized models as teacher assistants and utilizes
intermediate-length CoT sequences to bridge both the capacity and reasoning
length gaps. Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs
distilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they
achieve significant improvements in reasoning performance. Specifically,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieve an improvement of 3.47 and
3.93 respectively on average score on AIME2024, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500 and
GSM8K benchmarks. To better understand the mechanism behind MiCoTA, we perform
a quantitative experiment demonstrating that our method produces data more
closely aligned with base SLM distributions. Our insights pave the way for
future research into long-CoT data distillation for SLMs.

Abstract: Pruning is a highly effective approach for compressing large language models
(LLMs), significantly reducing inference latency. However, conventional
training-free structured pruning methods often employ a heuristic metric that
indiscriminately removes some attention heads across all pruning layers,
without considering their positions within the network architecture. In this
work, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention
heads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can
alter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive
rescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to
counteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of
LLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B. Our
evaluation includes both generation and discriminative tasks across 27
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing structured pruning methods. This improvement is particularly notable
in generation tasks, where our approach significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large
language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and
experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have
explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the
context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop
systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of
scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive
survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our
understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this
gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on
AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows:
(1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify
five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key
research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor
and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3)
Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources,
including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We
hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these
resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

Motivation: 现有方法难以有效对齐多样化且可能冲突的人类偏好。

Method: 采用多梯度下降的GAPO方法，自适应调整梯度以平衡目标间的权衡；P-GAPO进一步结合用户偏好。

Result: 理论证明GAPO收敛于帕累托最优解；实验显示其在Mistral-7B上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GAPO和P-GAPO为LLM与多样化人类偏好的对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful
technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a
significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this
issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization
problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We
introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning
paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse
preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each
objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the
trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which
incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto
solutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for
multiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both
helpfulness and harmlessness.

TL;DR: 研究通过精选教师模型的推理轨迹（NaturalThoughts）提升学生模型的推理能力，发现选择多样化推理策略的困难样本更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨教师模型的哪些推理演示对学生模型推理能力提升最有效。

Method: 从NaturalReasoning问题库中精选高质量推理轨迹（NaturalThoughts），分析影响推理能力蒸馏的因素。

Result: 选择困难且多样化的样本更高效，NaturalThoughts在多个基准测试中优于现有数据集。

Conclusion: 精选高质量推理样本能显著提升学生模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that distilling reasoning traces from a larger teacher
model via supervised finetuning outperforms reinforcement learning with the
smaller student model alone (Guo et al. 2025). However, there has not been a
systematic study of what kind of reasoning demonstrations from the teacher are
most effective in improving the student model's reasoning capabilities. In this
work we curate high-quality "NaturalThoughts" by selecting reasoning traces
from a strong teacher model based on a large pool of questions from
NaturalReasoning (Yuan et al. 2025). We first conduct a systematic analysis of
factors that affect distilling reasoning capabilities, in terms of sample
efficiency and scalability for general reasoning tasks. We observe that simply
scaling up data size with random sampling is a strong baseline with steady
performance gains. Further, we find that selecting difficult examples that
require more diverse reasoning strategies is more sample-efficient to transfer
the teacher model's reasoning skills. Evaluated on both Llama and Qwen models,
training with NaturalThoughts outperforms existing reasoning datasets such as
OpenThoughts, LIMO, etc. on general STEM reasoning benchmarks including
GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-Pro and SuperGPQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLG评估方法（如n-gram重叠或句子合理性）与高风险领域决策效果相关性较弱，需更直接的评估方式。

Method: 提出决策导向框架，通过人类投资者和LLM代理基于生成文本的金融交易表现评估决策质量。

Result: 人类和LLM代理仅依赖摘要时表现不优于随机；但结合分析性评论后，人机协作团队显著优于单独个体。

Conclusion: 强调评估生成文本应关注其促进人机协同决策的能力，传统内在指标存在局限性。

Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) is increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains, yet common intrinsic evaluation methods, such as n-gram overlap or
sentence plausibility, weakly correlate with actual decision-making efficacy.
We propose a decision-oriented framework for evaluating generated text by
directly measuring its influence on human and large language model (LLM)
decision outcomes. Using market digest texts--including objective morning
summaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess
decision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human
investors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our
findings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random
performance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical
commentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual
human or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance
of evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic
decision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of
traditional intrinsic metrics.

optimization, including learning rate, epochs, and model checkpoint selection,
we have compared the models based on Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error

outperformed Whisper across all key evaluation metrics, demonstrated superior
performance while requiring fewer computational resources, and offered valuable
insights to develop robust speech recognition systems in low-resource

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在敏感领域（如同行评审和心理健康）的快速部署，需要更深入地评估其对对话的理解能力。

Method: 通过评估LLMs在辩论中的表现，并测量其与对话结构和语用背景理解的关系。

Result: LLMs能进行连贯且有说服力的辩论，但无法展示对深层对话结构的理解。

Conclusion: LLMs作为评估者的局限性源于其对上下文理解的不足，辩论能力不依赖于对内容的真正理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are excellent at maintaining high-level,
convincing dialogues. They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators
in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This,
along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a
closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we
begin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet
most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability
relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their
comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that
LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the
beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or
suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the
arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures
of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings
tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand
the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that,
if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to
know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and
coherence are secondary to effectiveness.

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人数据集上，生成的视频在视觉稳定性和空间对齐性上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法支持机器人操作和适应新视角，通过预测的4D视频恢复机器人末端执行器轨迹。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a
robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While
recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic
scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically
consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address
this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D
consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap
alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to
learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future
video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D
observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing
baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned
predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We
further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot
end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting
robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

Abstract: Biological image analysis has traditionally focused on measuring specific
visual properties of interest for cells or other entities. A complementary
paradigm gaining increasing traction is image-based profiling - quantifying
many distinct visual features to form comprehensive profiles which may reveal
hidden patterns in cellular states, drug responses, and disease mechanisms.
While current tools like CellProfiler can generate these feature sets, they
pose significant barriers to automated and reproducible analyses, hindering
machine learning workflows. Here we introduce cp_measure, a Python library that
extracts CellProfiler's core measurement capabilities into a modular, API-first
tool designed for programmatic feature extraction. We demonstrate that
cp_measure features retain high fidelity with CellProfiler features while
enabling seamless integration with the scientific Python ecosystem. Through
applications to 3D astrocyte imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we showcase
how cp_measure enables reproducible, automated image-based profiling pipelines
that scale effectively for machine learning applications in computational
biology.

Method: 提出PDCs和DCR策略，结合传统SOD对比线索与现代CNN特征提取；针对视频SOD引入STDC。

Result: SDNet和STDNet在Jetson Orin设备上分别达到46 FPS和150 FPS，速度和准确性均优于其他轻量级模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在效率和准确性之间取得了显著平衡，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of deploying salient object detection
(SOD) on resource-constrained devices with real-time performance. While recent
advances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models
are computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that
combines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs.
Like biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast
cues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel
Difference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently,
PDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues
are extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference
convolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard
convolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference.
Additionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for
video SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast
capture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve
significant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. On a Jetson Orin
device, our models with $<$ 1M parameters operate at 46 FPS and 150 FPS on
streamed images and videos, surpassing the second-best lightweight models in
our experiments by more than $2\times$ and $3\times$ in speed with superior
accuracy. Code will be available at https://github.com/hellozhuo/stdnet.git.

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理模态缺失问题，显著提升分割准确性，为实际临床应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal MRI provides critical complementary information for accurate brain
tumor segmentation. However, conventional methods struggle when certain
modalities are missing due to issues such as image quality, protocol
inconsistencies, patient allergies, or financial constraints. To address this,
we propose a robust single-modality parallel processing framework that achieves
high segmentation accuracy even with incomplete modalities. Leveraging Holder
divergence and mutual information, our model maintains modality-specific
features while dynamically adjusting network parameters based on the available
inputs. By using these divergence- and information-based loss functions, the
framework effectively quantifies discrepancies between predictions and
ground-truth labels, resulting in consistently accurate segmentation. Extensive
evaluations on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate superior
performance over existing methods in handling missing modalities.

Conclusion: AIGVE-MACS为AI生成视频评估提供了全面、人类对齐的新范式。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated video models has created a pressing
need for robust and interpretable evaluation frameworks. Existing metrics are
limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting
in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those
challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video
Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also
multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos.
Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising
2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and
numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging
AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a
novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better
align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly
outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we
further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from
AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5%
quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive,
human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2

Abstract: Weed mapping plays a critical role in precision management by providing
accurate and timely data on weed distribution, enabling targeted control and
reduced herbicide use. This minimizes environmental impacts, supports
sustainable land management, and improves outcomes across agricultural and
natural environments. Recent advances in weed mapping leverage ground-vehicle
Red Green Blue (RGB) cameras, satellite and drone-based remote sensing combined
with sensors such as spectral, Near Infra-Red (NIR), and thermal cameras. The
resulting data are processed using advanced techniques including big data
analytics and machine learning, significantly improving the spatial and
temporal resolution of weed maps and enabling site-specific management
decisions. Despite a growing body of research in this domain, there is a lack
of comprehensive literature reviews specifically focused on weed mapping. In
particular, the absence of a structured analysis spanning the entire mapping
pipeline, from data acquisition to processing techniques and mapping tools,
limits progress in the field. This review addresses these gaps by
systematically examining state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition (sensor
and platform technologies), data processing (including annotation and
modelling), and mapping techniques (such as spatiotemporal analysis and
decision support tools). Following PRISMA guidelines, we critically evaluate
and synthesize key findings from the literature to provide a holistic
understanding of the weed mapping landscape. This review serves as a
foundational reference to guide future research and support the development of
efficient, scalable, and sustainable weed management systems.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: 频域扩散模型结合ARE和PCM有效解决了无配对去雾问题。

Abstract: Unpaired image dehazing has attracted increasing attention due to its
flexible data requirements during model training. Dominant methods based on
contrastive learning not only introduce haze-unrelated content information, but
also ignore haze-specific properties in the frequency domain (\ie,~haze-related
degradation is mainly manifested in the amplitude spectrum). To address these
issues, we propose a novel frequency domain-based diffusion model, named \ours,
for fully exploiting the beneficial knowledge in unpaired clear data. In
particular, inspired by the strong generative ability shown by Diffusion Models
(DMs), we tackle the dehazing task from the perspective of frequency domain
reconstruction and perform the DMs to yield the amplitude spectrum consistent
with the distribution of clear images. To implement it, we propose an Amplitude
Residual Encoder (ARE) to extract the amplitude residuals, which effectively
compensates for the amplitude gap from the hazy to clear domains, as well as
provide supervision for the DMs training. In addition, we propose a Phase
Correction Module (PCM) to eliminate artifacts by further refining the phase
spectrum during dehazing with a simple attention mechanism. Experimental
results demonstrate that our \ours outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Although the generalization of conventional methodologies has advanced visual
interpretability, there remains paucity of research that preserves the unified
feature representation on single task learning during the training process. In
this work, we introduce ET-Fuser, a novel methodology for learning ensemble
token by leveraging attention mechanisms based on task priors derived from
pre-trained models for facial analysis. Specifically, we propose a robust prior
unification learning method that generates a ensemble token within a
self-attention mechanism, which shares the mutual information along the
pre-trained encoders. This ensemble token approach offers high efficiency with
negligible computational cost. Our results show improvements across a variety
of facial analysis, with statistically significant enhancements observed in the
feature representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过将任务重新定义为铬球修复问题，从单张低动态范围（LDR）图像估计光照的简单有效方法，利用预训练的扩散模型Stable Diffusion XL，并通过迭代修复生成高质量结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖有限的HDR全景数据集，泛化能力不足，因此需要一种更通用的光照估计方法。

Method: 使用DiffusionLight进行迭代修复生成中值铬球作为稳定低频光照先验，并通过Exposure LoRA生成HDR光探针；进一步提出DiffusionLight-Turbo，通过Turbo LoRA直接预测平均铬球，大幅提升速度。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多样化场景中生成可信的光照估计，并在真实场景中表现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DiffusionLight及其加速版本DiffusionLight-Turbo提供了一种高效且通用的光照估计解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a simple yet effective technique for estimating lighting from a
single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image by reframing the task as a chrome ball
inpainting problem. This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,
Stable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing
methods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,
the task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or
inconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.
Our analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the
initial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic
outputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses
iterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to
serve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a
high-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,
an Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure
values, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is
time-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce
this overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to
about 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by
training a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the
iterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising
pass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method
produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates
superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理约束提高了估计精度，扩展了人体动力学学习的应用场景。

Abstract: Body dynamics are crucial information for the analysis of human motions in
important research fields, ranging from biomechanics, sports science to
computer vision and graphics. Modern approaches collect the body dynamics,
external reactive force specifically, via force plates, synchronizing with
human motion capture data, and learn to estimate the dynamics from a black-box
deep learning model. Being specialized devices, force plates can only be
installed in laboratory setups, imposing a significant limitation on the
learning of human dynamics. To this end, we propose a novel method for
estimating human ground reaction dynamics directly from the more reliable
motion capture data with physics laws and computational simulation as
constrains. We introduce a highly accurate and robust method for computing
ground reaction forces from motion capture data using Euler's integration
scheme and PD algorithm. The physics-based reactive forces are used to inform
the learning model about the physics-informed motion dynamics thus improving
the estimation accuracy. The proposed approach was tested on the GroundLink
dataset, outperforming the baseline model on: 1) the ground reaction force
estimation accuracy compared to the force plates measurement; and 2) our
simulated root trajectory precision. The implementation code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级方法，通过学习后光照估计映射，将中性白平衡转换为美学偏好，实现跨相机美学一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业自动白平衡（AWB）系统通常追求美学偏好而非中性色彩校正，且现有学习型方法难以泛化到不同相机传感器。

Method: 提出一种后光照估计映射，将中性白平衡转换为美学偏好的相机无关空间，模型仅含约500参数，计算高效。

Result: 在771张智能手机图像数据集上，方法达到最优性能，计算时间仅0.024毫秒，兼容现有跨相机AWB技术。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现跨相机美学一致性，轻量高效，适用于多相机智能手机。

Abstract: The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of
several modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in
a display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is
essential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB
systems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than
accurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved
AWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera
sensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has
explored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral
white balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic
consistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms
neutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a
camera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any
neutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across
unseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\sim$500
parameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile
CPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different
cameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully
compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal
computational and memory overhead.

Motivation: 现有测试时间增强方法通用性不足，GTTA旨在提供一种通用且高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过随机扰动PCA子空间投影形成集成，并引入自监督学习阶段优化模型。

Result: 在多种任务和数据集上验证了GTTA的通用性和有效性，尤其在低能见度水下视频任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: GTTA是一种通用且高效的测试时间增强方法，适用于多种任务，并能显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: We introduce Generalized Test-Time Augmentation (GTTA), a highly effective
method for improving the performance of a trained model, which unlike other
existing Test-Time Augmentation approaches from the literature is general
enough to be used off-the-shelf for many vision and non-vision tasks, such as
classification, regression, image segmentation and object detection. By
applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple
times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA forms robust ensembles
at test time in which, due to sound statistical properties, the structural and
systematic noises in the initial input data is filtered out and final estimator
errors are reduced. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a
final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an
unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus
reducing significantly the test time computational cost, at no loss in
accuracy. Our tests and comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on
various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image
classification and segmentation, speech recognition and house price prediction,
validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its
effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and
detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce
DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.

Motivation: 现有MoE框架在视觉-语言模型中忽视了视觉和语言模态间的分布差异，且缺乏对视觉尾部令牌的有效处理。

Method: 提出LTDR，包括模态感知路由策略和针对视觉尾部令牌的专家激活增强方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了LTDR的有效性。

Conclusion: LTDR通过模态感知路由和尾部令牌增强，提升了视觉-语言MoE模型的性能。

Abstract: The mixture-of-experts (MoE), which replaces dense models with sparse
architectures, has gained attention in large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
achieving comparable performance with fewer activated parameters. Existing MoE
frameworks for LVLMs focus on token-to-expert routing (TER), encouraging
different experts to specialize in processing distinct tokens. However, these
frameworks often rely on the load balancing mechanism, overlooking the inherent
distributional differences between vision and language. To this end, we propose
a Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER,
tackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific
routing. We observe that language TER follows a uniform distribution, whereas
vision TER exhibits a long-tailed distribution. This discrepancy necessitates
distinct routing strategies tailored to each modality. (2) Enhancing expert
activation for vision tail tokens. Recognizing the importance of vision tail
tokens, we introduce an oversampling-like strategy by increasing the number of
activated experts for these tokens. Experiments on extensive benchmarks
validate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理对抗攻击方法在安全关键场景（如自动驾驶）中暴露了深度神经网络的脆弱性。现有伪装攻击方法依赖目标对象的网格先验和模拟器构建的虚拟环境，耗时且与真实世界存在差异，导致对抗效果和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出PGA框架，利用3DGS实现快速精确的3D重建和逼真渲染，通过防止高斯间的相互和自遮挡，以及采用min-max优化调整每个视角的背景，提升跨视角鲁棒性和对抗效果。

Result: 大量实验验证了PGA的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: PGA框架显著提升了物理对抗攻击在多视角和复杂环境中的效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural
networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as
autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising
approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial
effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies
on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by
simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the
real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training
images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial
camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,
prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse
viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and
precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering
capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and
adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among
Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the
imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out
non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available

Motivation: 对齐大型语言模型（LLMs）和大型多模态模型（LMMs）到人类偏好是提升生成输出质量的关键，传统奖励建模难以适应新偏好。

Method: 引入Activation RMs，通过激活导向构建奖励信号，仅需少量监督且无需额外模型微调。

Result: Activation RMs在标准奖励建模基准上优于现有少样本方法，并在新基准PreferenceHack上表现最佳。

Conclusion: Activation RMs是一种高效且安全的少样本奖励建模方法，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to
human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the
models' generative outputs for real-world applications. A common approach is to
use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training
using reinforcement learning. However, traditional reward modeling is not
easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward
model, commonly trained on large preference datasets. To address this, we
introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward
modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned
reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning.
Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as
LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token
probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking
behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. Toward
this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the
first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.
Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.

Motivation: 当前AI在科学发现中的工作流程缺乏准确性和统计保证，需要一种更高效、可靠的方法。

Method: 采用人机协作框架，AI预测测量值，通过重要性采样选择样本进行人工标注，迭代优化模型并计算无偏估计。

Result: 主动测量在多个测量任务中减少了估计误差，即使AI模型不完美也能提供精确估计。

Conclusion: 主动测量是一种高效且可靠的科学测量方法，适用于AI辅助的科学研究。

Abstract: AI has the potential to transform scientific discovery by analyzing vast
datasets with little human effort. However, current workflows often do not
provide the accuracy or statistical guarantees that are needed. We introduce
active measurement, a human-in-the-loop AI framework for scientific
measurement. An AI model is used to predict measurements for individual units,
which are then sampled for human labeling using importance sampling. With each
new set of human labels, the AI model is improved and an unbiased Monte Carlo
estimate of the total measurement is refined. Active measurement can provide
precise estimates even with an imperfect AI model, and requires little human
effort when the AI model is very accurate. We derive novel estimators,
weighting schemes, and confidence intervals, and show that active measurement
reduces estimation error compared to alternatives in several measurement tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在弱监督和模型架构的限制下，难以同时提升段级和事件级预测性能。

Method: 通过伪标签增强生成新数据，并利用音频-视觉Mamba网络处理特征和模态交互，以提升解析能力并排除噪声干扰。

Result: 在LLP数据集上，MUG在所有指标上均优于现有方法（如视觉段级和音频段级指标分别提升2.1%和1.2%）。

Conclusion: MUG通过伪标签增强和Mamba网络，显著提升了弱监督音频-视觉视频解析的性能。

Abstract: The weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to predict all
modality-specific events and locate their temporal boundaries. Despite
significant progress, due to the limitations of the weakly-supervised and the
deficiencies of the model architecture, existing methods are lacking in
simultaneously improving both the segment-level prediction and the event-level
prediction. In this work, we propose a audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo
labeling aUGmentation (MUG) for emphasising the uniqueness of each segment and
excluding the noise interference from the alternate modalities. Specifically,
we annotate some of the pseudo-labels based on previous work. Using unimodal
pseudo-labels, we perform cross-modal random combinations to generate new data,
which can enhance the model's ability to parse various segment-level event
combinations. For feature processing and interaction, we employ a audio-visual
mamba network. The AV-Mamba enhances the ability to perceive different segments
and excludes additional modal noise while sharing similar modal information.
Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG improves state-of-the-art
results on LLP dataset in all metrics (e.g,, gains of 2.1% and 1.2% in terms of
visual Segment-level and audio Segment-level metrics). Our code is available at

Abstract: Fetal abdominal malformations are serious congenital anomalies that require
accurate diagnosis to guide pregnancy management and reduce mortality. Although
AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application
to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on
image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing
less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level
multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane
localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.
Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts
module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly,
we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align
image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token
selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype
learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal
abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748
images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
competitors. Codes are available at:https://github.com/LL-AC/AAcls.

Conclusion: FixTalk通过创新设计解决了说话头生成中的关键问题，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Talking head generation is gaining significant importance across various
domains, with a growing demand for high-quality rendering. However, existing
methods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA),
particularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous
approaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity
information embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information
can be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper
introduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both
issues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an
Enhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information
from motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads.
To address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes
the leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the
artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixTalk effectively mitigates
IL and RA, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了文档图像阴影去除的效果，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image
enhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant
color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a
diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called
DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space,
enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the
issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM).
It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions
specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion
module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by
supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a
shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in
document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color
shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic
color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models.
Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority
over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Conclusion: 通过结合先验信息和去噪技术，论文成功实现了车道段和拓扑的高效预测，为在线HD地图构建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Most autonomous cars rely on the availability of high-definition (HD) maps.
Current research aims to address this constraint by directly predicting HD map
elements from onboard sensors and reasoning about the relationships between the
predicted map and traffic elements. Despite recent advancements, the coherent
online construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it
necessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and
consistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to
predict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road
boundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly
available standard-definition (SD) maps. We propose a network architecture,
which leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and
denoising techniques to enhance training stability and performance.
Furthermore, we facilitate past frames for temporal consistency. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous
methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of our modeling scheme.

Conclusion: NOCTIS通过改进匹配机制和利用先进视觉基础模型，实现了无需训练的高效新物体实例分割。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some
example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision.
Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel
objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle
this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic
Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and
improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also
leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and
DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise
bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's
zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The
quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance
to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an
object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the
average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,
calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance
between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image
grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and
mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.
We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,
outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the
BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects"
task.

*Kuniaki Saito,Donghyun Kim,Kwanyong Park,Atsushi Hashimoto,Yoshitaka Ushiku*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出CaptionSmiths方法，通过量化标题属性并插值端点向量，实现单模型生成多样语言模式的标题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以精细控制生成标题的属性，如长度和描述性，且缺乏平滑过渡能力。

Method: 量化标题的三个属性（长度、描述性、词独特性）为连续标量，通过插值端点向量实现条件控制。

Result: 模型能平滑调整标题属性，词汇对齐优于基线，长度控制误差减少506%。

Conclusion: CaptionSmiths为生成多样语言模式的标题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: An image captioning model flexibly switching its language pattern, e.g.,
descriptiveness and length, should be useful since it can be applied to diverse
applications. However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative
vision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated
captions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the
properties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot
smoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given
this challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single
captioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach
quantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and
uniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.
Given the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two
endpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very
short caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate
that the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output
captions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance,
CaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506\% despite
better lexical alignment. Code will be available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度方向的OOD检测方法，通过短路虚假梯度提升检测效果，同时保持ID分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放环境中，OOD检测对模型安全部署至关重要。观察到ID和OOD样本在梯度方向上的差异，提出利用这一现象改进检测。

Method: 在推理阶段短路虚假梯度，避免重新计算logits，采用局部一阶近似高效实现。

Result: 在标准OOD基准测试中表现显著提升，方法轻量且易于集成。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用中的OOD检测提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safely deploying deep
models in open-world environments, where inputs may lie outside the training
distribution. During inference on a model trained exclusively with
In-Distribution (ID) data, we observe a salient gradient phenomenon: around an
ID sample, the local gradient directions for "enhancing" that sample's
predicted class remain relatively consistent, whereas OOD samples--unseen in
training--exhibit disorganized or conflicting gradient directions in the same
neighborhood. Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage
technique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients
exploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely
intact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient
short-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that
accurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward
pass. Experiments on standard OOD benchmarks show our approach yields
substantial improvements. Moreover, the method is lightweight and requires
minimal changes to the standard inference pipeline, offering a practical path
toward robust OOD detection in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious
facial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity
verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient
robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of
watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel
robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By
modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and
watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise
and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial
condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that
gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus
better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the
fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)
module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract
watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.
To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we
integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake
manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that
employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling
process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes.
Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/DiffMark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球变暖、生物多样性丧失和空气污染等问题亟需森林监测，但现有方法存在不足，因此需要结合多种技术提升监测效果。

Method: 结合传统方法（用于特征提取和分割）和深度学习方法（用于树冠检测），并通过规则化后处理优化结果。

Result: 提出的方法在树冠检测数量上表现更优，同时分析了其优缺点和改进空间。

Conclusion: 规则化方法有效提升了树冠检测的准确性和鲁棒性，为森林监测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Global warming, loss of biodiversity, and air pollution are among the most
significant problems facing Earth. One of the primary challenges in addressing
these issues is the lack of monitoring forests to protect them. To tackle this
problem, it is important to leverage remote sensing and computer vision methods
to automate monitoring applications. Hence, automatic tree crown detection
algorithms emerged based on traditional and deep learning methods. In this
study, we first introduce two different tree crown detection methods based on
these approaches. Then, we form a novel rule-based approach that integrates
these two methods to enhance robustness and accuracy of tree crown detection
results. While traditional methods are employed for feature extraction and
segmentation of forested areas, deep learning methods are used to detect tree
crowns in our method. With the proposed rule-based approach, we post-process
these results, aiming to increase the number of detected tree crowns through
neighboring trees and localized operations. We compare the obtained results
with the proposed method in terms of the number of detected tree crowns and
report the advantages, disadvantages, and areas for improvement of the obtained
outcomes.

*Shaocheng Yan,Pengcheng Shi,Zhenjun Zhao,Kaixin Wang,Kuang Cao,Ji Wu,Jiayuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboReg提出了一种基于TurboClique和Pivot-Guided Search（PGS）的快速鲁棒点云配准方法，显著提升了速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于极大团搜索的点云配准方法虽然召回率高，但时间复杂度高，不适用于实时应用。

Method: 定义轻量级TurboClique（3-clique）和线性时间复杂度的PGS算法，通过高SC$^2$分数的匹配对引导搜索。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上达到SOTA性能，速度提升显著，例如在3DMatch+FCGF数据集上比3DMAC快208.22倍。

Conclusion: TurboReg通过高效并行搜索和鲁棒的空间一致性，实现了快速且高精度的点云配准。

Abstract: Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud
Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in
compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time
complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel
lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided
Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a
highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique
allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained
compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable
transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$
scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with
higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity
and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with
exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with
substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset,
TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving
higher recall. Our code is accessible at

Abstract: The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a
vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However,
these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians,
due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends
beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel

Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of
PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on
identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of
semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a
systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments
show improved performance in practical cross-dataset Re-ID scenarios, notably
from Market-1501 to CUHK03-np (detected), highlighting the framework's
practical utility. Code is available at https://github.com/RAufschlaeger/cRID.

Conclusion: OoDDINO有效提升异常分割的准确性和适应性，可作为插件增强其他模型性能。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation aims to identify Out-of-Distribution (OoD) anomalous
objects within images. Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly
scores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment
anomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant
challenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations
among pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)
variabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing
global thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or
miss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel
multi-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these
limitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO
combines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level
segmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we
propose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that
sequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual
representations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection
model's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we
develop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically
generates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs
and pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding
strategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained
anomaly segmentation. The proposed framework is compatible with other
pixel-wise anomaly detection models, which acts as a plug-in to boost the
performance. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate our
framework's superiority and compatibility over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如REPA）在扩散模型中利用外部视觉表示进行对齐，但未能充分利用判别性表示。

Method: REG方法将低层图像潜在表示与预训练模型的高层类别标记结合，生成图像-类别对。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，REG显著加速收敛，训练效率提升63倍和23倍，生成质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: REG通过语义知识主动指导图像生成，以极低计算开销实现了高效训练和高质量生成。

Abstract: REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion
models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models,
through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks
and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external
alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls
short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In
this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation
Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with
a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for
denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs
directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and
training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference
overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\%
increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs
both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired
semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process.
On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence
acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster
training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively,
SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA
trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer). Code is available at:

Conclusion: 本文填补了文献空白，为相关利益方提供了实践指导和防御建议。

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security
concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor
attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured
in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the
first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition
systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of
DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the
first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and
face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained
with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our
models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack
cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function
of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and
countermeasures.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and detecting its leaks early via
hyperspectral satellite imagery can help mitigate climate change. Meanwhile,
many existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing
potential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively,
onboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane
enhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited
onboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on
efficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,
CEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a
Mag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art
algorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection
potential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).
Our results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both
acceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally
efficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the
other more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than
original Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and
evaluate three band selection strategies. One of them can outperform the method
traditionally used in the field while using fewer channels, leading to even
faster processing without compromising accuracy. This research lays the
foundation for future advancements in onboard methane detection with minimal
hardware requirements, improving timely data delivery. The produced code, data,
and models are open-sourced and can be accessed from

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HOT检测模型局限于单一图像类型，导致过度分割和类别不一致，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: P3HOT框架结合语义驱动提示机制和人类近端感知机制，引入RJLoss和AD-Acc.评估指标。

Result: 在HOT-Annotated数据集上，模型在四个指标上分别提升了0.7、2.0、1.6和11.0。

Conclusion: P3HOT框架显著提升了HOT检测的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the
specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless,
current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too
much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain
category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT
framework, termed \textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \textbf{P}rompt
guidance and human \textbf{P}roximal \textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we
utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention
towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text.
Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive
key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively
eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth
resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D
perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss
(RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the
same area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address
the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets.
Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of \textbf{0.7}$\uparrow$,
\textbf{2.0}$\uparrow$, \textbf{1.6}$\uparrow$, and \textbf{11.0}$\uparrow$ in
SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated
dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/YuxiaoWang-AI/P3HOT.

Abstract: Visual pose tracking is playing an increasingly vital role in industrial
contexts in recent years. However, the pose tracking for industrial metal
objects remains a challenging task especially in the real world-environments,
due to the reflection characteristic of metal objects. To address this issue,
we propose a novel 6DoF pose tracking method based on active control points.
The method uses image control points to generate edge feature for optimization
actively instead of 6DoF pose-based rendering, and serve them as optimization
variables. We also introduce an optimal control point regression method to
improve robustness. The proposed tracking method performs effectively in both
dataset evaluation and real world tasks, providing a viable solution for
real-time tracking of industrial metal objects. Our source code is made

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeRF方法因内存限制难以处理大场景，需要一种高效且不损失质量的大规模3D重建方法。

Method: 提出Snake-NeRF框架，采用分块处理、图像重叠裁剪、2×2 3D瓦片策略和分段采样器，避免边缘重建错误。

Result: 实验表明，Snake-NeRF能在单GPU上线性时间处理大卫星图像，且不损失重建质量。

Conclusion: Snake-NeRF成功解决了大场景3D重建的内存和效率问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D
reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF
methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint
during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale
NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces
Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method
eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and
operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest
into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with
overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We
introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented
sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges.
Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be
processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise
in quality.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) map construction methods are crucial for providing
precise and comprehensive static environmental information, which is essential
for autonomous driving systems. While Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques have shown
promising results by integrating data from both modalities, existing approaches
primarily focus on improving model accuracy and often neglect the robustness of
perception models, which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In
this paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal
fusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy. We
propose three key components: data augmentation, a novel multi-modal fusion
module, and a modality dropout training strategy. These components are
evaluated on a challenging dataset containing 10 days of NuScenes data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly
enhance the robustness of baseline methods. Furthermore, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the clean validation set of the NuScenes
dataset. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and
reliable HD map construction models, advancing their applicability in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Project website:

TL;DR: DepthAnything-AC是一种基础单目深度估计模型，能在多样化环境条件下工作，通过无监督一致性正则化微调和空间距离约束提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础MDE模型在复杂开放世界环境中表现不佳，如光照变化、恶劣天气和传感器失真等挑战条件。

Method: 提出无监督一致性正则化微调范式，仅需少量未标记数据，并引入空间距离约束以学习补丁级相对关系。

Result: 实验表明，DepthAnything-AC在多样基准测试（包括恶劣天气、合成失真和通用场景）中具有零样本能力。

Conclusion: DepthAnything-AC通过创新方法解决了复杂环境下的深度估计问题，表现出色。

Abstract: We present Depth Anything at Any Condition (DepthAnything-AC), a foundation
monocular depth estimation (MDE) model capable of handling diverse
environmental conditions. Previous foundation MDE models achieve impressive
performance across general scenes but not perform well in complex open-world
environments that involve challenging conditions, such as illumination
variations, adverse weather, and sensor-induced distortions. To overcome the
challenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality
pseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency
regularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount
of unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to
explicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships,
resulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details.
Experimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC
across diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks,
synthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.

Result: 在LOVE@CVPR'25 Workshop Track 1A中取得第一名，VDCSCORE评估指标表现突出。

Conclusion: AVC-DPO通过偏好对齐有效提升了视频MLLM的标题生成能力。

Abstract: Although video multimodal large language models (video MLLMs) have achieved
substantial progress in video captioning tasks, it remains challenging to
adjust the focal emphasis of video captions according to human preferences. To
address this limitation, we propose Aligned Video Captioning via Direct
Preference Optimization (AVC-DPO), a post-training framework designed to
enhance captioning capabilities in video MLLMs through preference alignment.
Our approach designs enhanced prompts that specifically target temporal
dynamics and spatial information-two key factors that humans care about when
watching a video-thereby incorporating human-centric preferences. AVC-DPO
leverages the same foundation model's caption generation responses under varied
prompt conditions to conduct preference-aware training and caption alignment.
Using this framework, we have achieved exceptional performance in the
LOVE@CVPR'25 Workshop Track 1A: Video Detailed Captioning Challenge, achieving
first place on the Video Detailed Captioning (VDC) benchmark according to the
VDCSCORE evaluation metric.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型注意力机制LASAD，结合空间感知衰减，解决了线性注意力在图像生成中无法捕捉长距离依赖的问题，并实现了线性复杂度和高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型依赖Transformer架构，计算复杂且内存开销大；线性注意力虽能降低负担，但在图像生成中表现不佳。

Method: 提出LASAD机制，通过2D空间位置计算衰减因子，保留空间关系；基于此构建LASADGen模型。

Result: 在ImageNet上实现SOTA生成性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: LASADGen在高效性和空间理解之间取得平衡，为高质量图像生成提供新思路。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have garnered significant attention in image
generation for their ability to effectively capture both local and global
structures within visual data. However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely
on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational
complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due
to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention
mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our
initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation
quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies
in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a
novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial
relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing
position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than
1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an
autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant
spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen
achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational
efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial
understanding needed for high-quality generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的ReFlow真实图像编辑方法，通过分析多模态Transformer块的中间表示，提取关键特征，并利用中步潜在表示提升编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ReFlow在文本到图像生成中表现优异，但其在真实图像编辑中的应用仍具挑战性。

Method: 分析多模态Transformer块的中间表示，提取三个关键特征；利用中步潜在表示保持结构；调整注意力机制以提升编辑性和文本对齐。

Result: 在两项基准测试中优于九种基线方法，人类评估显示用户偏好该方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、无需用户提供掩码，且在无源提示的情况下仍可应用，表现优越。

Abstract: Rectified Flow text-to-image models surpass diffusion models in image quality
and text alignment, but adapting ReFlow for real-image editing remains
challenging. We propose a new real-image editing method for ReFlow by analyzing
the intermediate representations of multimodal transformer blocks and
identifying three key features. To extract these features from real images with
sufficient structural preservation, we leverage mid-step latent, which is
inverted only up to the mid-step. We then adapt attention during injection to
improve editability and enhance alignment to the target text. Our method is
training-free, requires no user-provided mask, and can be applied even without
a source prompt. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with nine baselines
demonstrate its superior performance over prior methods, further validated by
human evaluations confirming a strong user preference for our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 息肉分割在结肠镜图像中对结直肠癌的早期检测至关重要，但由于息肉形状、大小和颜色的多样性，以及边界模糊等问题，现有方法表现不佳。

Method: 提出SAM-MaGuP，结合边界蒸馏模块和1D-2D Mamba适配器，增强特征学习和全局上下文交互。

Result: 在五个数据集上的评估显示，SAM-MaGuP优于现有方法，实现了更高的分割准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAM-MaGuP通过创新的Mamba引导边界先验和1D-2D Mamba块，为息肉分割领域设定了新标准。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images is crucial for early detection and
diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, this task remains a significant
challenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as
well as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often
compounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and
transformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with
stable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These
methods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps
and capture essential boundary cues. Moreover, their generalizability still
falls short of meeting the demands of real-time clinical applications. To
address these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for
robust polyp segmentation. By incorporating a boundary distillation module and
a 1D-2D Mamba adapter within the Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM-MaGuP excels
at resolving weak boundary challenges and amplifies feature learning through
enriched global contextual interactions. Extensive evaluations across five
diverse datasets reveal that SAM-MaGuP outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving unmatched segmentation accuracy and robustness. Our key innovations,
a Mamba-guided boundary prior and a 1D-2D Mamba block, set a new benchmark in
the field, pushing the boundaries of polyp segmentation to new heights.

Conclusion: 姿态数据预处理技术对SLT性能有重要影响，改进的T5模型结合预处理策略能有效提升翻译效果。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) has evolved significantly, moving from
isolated recognition approaches to complex, continuous gloss-free translation
systems. This paper explores the impact of pose-based data preprocessing
techniques - normalization, interpolation, and augmentation - on SLT
performance. We employ a transformer-based architecture, adapting a modified T5
encoder-decoder model to process pose representations. Through extensive
ablation studies on YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets, we analyze how different
preprocessing strategies affect translation accuracy. Our results demonstrate
that appropriate normalization, interpolation, and augmentation techniques can
significantly improve model robustness and generalization abilities.
Additionally, we provide a deep analysis of the model's attentions and reveal
interesting behavior suggesting that adding a dedicated register token can
improve overall model performance. We publish our code on our GitHub
repository, including the preprocessed YouTubeASL data.

TL;DR: Vision transformers (ViTs)在医学影像任务中表现优异，但其表示缺乏语义意义且易受微小变化影响，导致分类结果不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ViT在医学影像分类中的表示是否具有语义意义及其对微小变化的脆弱性。

Method: 使用基于投影梯度的算法分析ViT的表示。

Result: ViT的表示缺乏语义意义，微小变化可导致分类准确率下降60%以上。

Conclusion: ViT在医学影像分类中的表示存在根本性问题，可能影响其在安全关键系统中的部署。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging
tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their
superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due
to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they
are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the
representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this
paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their
representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently
vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have
very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to
different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such
vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example,
unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over
60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically
demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT
representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical
challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.

Conclusion: TrackingMiM是一种高效且高性能的无人机跟踪解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) model has long struggled with the challenge of
quadratic complexity, a limitation that becomes especially critical in unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking systems, where data must be processed in real
time. In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba,
leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence
modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First,
we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based
methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the
Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose
TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model
for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba
scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and
spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query
token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted
on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves
state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV
tracking.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced numerous opportunities for human
assistance and task automation in medicine. However, it suffers from poor
generalization in the presence of shifts in the data distribution. In the
context of AI-based computed tomography (CT) analysis, significant data
distribution shifts can be caused by changes in scanner manufacturer,
reconstruction technique or dose. AI harmonization techniques can address this
problem by reducing distribution shifts caused by various acquisition settings.
This paper presents an open-source benchmark dataset containing CT scans of an
anthropomorphic phantom acquired with various scanners and settings, which
purpose is to foster the development of AI harmonization techniques. Using a
phantom allows fixing variations attributed to inter- and intra-patient
variations. The dataset includes 1378 image series acquired with 13 scanners
from 4 manufacturers across 8 institutions using a harmonized protocol as well
as several acquisition doses. Additionally, we present a methodology, baseline
results and open-source code to assess image- and feature-level stability and

Abstract: The field of neuromorphic vision is developing rapidly, and event cameras are
finding their way into more and more applications. However, the data stream
from these sensors is characterised by significant noise. In this paper, we
propose a method for event data that is capable of removing approximately 99\%

four algorithms based on the matrix of infinite impulse response (IIR) filters
method. We compared them on several event datasets that were further modified
by adding artificially generated noise and noise recorded with dynamic vision
sensor. The proposed methods use about 30KB of memory for a sensor with a
resolution of 1280 x 720 and is therefore well suited for implementation in
embedded devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖判别式学习，擅长捕捉低频特征但忽视高频边界细节，而扩散生成模型擅长生成高频细节但语义推理不足。

Method: IDGBR框架先用判别式模型生成粗分割图，再通过条件引导网络和扩散去噪过程细化边界。

Result: 在五个遥感数据集上的实验表明，IDGBR能一致地改进不同判别式架构的粗分割结果。

Conclusion: 结合判别式和生成式学习的IDGBR框架有效提升了语义分割的边界精度。

Abstract: Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground
objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently,
segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of
large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise
localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,
which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its
inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic
segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models
excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms
that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability
to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models
exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided
solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both
discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of
Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement
(IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map
using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed
into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation
subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the
coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic
segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our
framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results
from diverse discriminative architectures. The source code will be available at

Abstract: The production of high-quality 2D animation is highly labor-intensive
process, as animators are currently required to draw and color a large number
of frames by hand. We present SketchColour, the first sketch-to-colour pipeline
for 2D animation built on a diffusion transformer (DiT) backbone. By replacing
the conventional U-Net denoiser with a DiT-style architecture and injecting
sketch information via lightweight channel-concatenation adapters accompanied
with LoRA finetuning, our method natively integrates conditioning without the
parameter and memory bloat of a duplicated ControlNet, greatly reducing
parameter count and GPU memory usage. Evaluated on the SAKUGA dataset,
SketchColour outperforms previous state-of-the-art video colourization methods
across all metrics, despite using only half the training data of competing
models. Our approach produces temporally coherent animations with minimal
artifacts such as colour bleeding or object deformation. Our code is available

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable
progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of
understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular
multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0
Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision
tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and
surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and
its variants, etc).
  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to
output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or
3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at
an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these
challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable
and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized
benchmarking framework.
  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art
specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;
this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based
tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)
While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit
less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among
non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)
reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a
preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest
GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial
misalignments.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于相机参数的可控去噪框架，通过ISO、快门速度和光圈值调整去噪强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法缺乏根据噪声水平、相机设置和用户偏好调整去噪强度的灵活性。

Method: 将ISO、快门速度和光圈值转换为向量，控制去噪网络的性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法为标准去噪网络增加了可控性并提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了基于相机参数的自适应去噪。

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based image denoising methods have shown impressive
performance; however, many lack the flexibility to adjust the denoising
strength based on the noise levels, camera settings, and user preferences. In
this paper, we introduce a new controllable denoising framework that adaptively
removes noise from images by utilizing information from camera parameters.
Specifically, we focus on ISO, shutter speed, and F-number, which are closely
related to noise levels. We convert these selected parameters into a vector to
control and enhance the performance of the denoising network. Experimental
results show that our method seamlessly adds controllability to standard
denoising neural networks and improves their performance. Code is available at

*Zhuoyang Zhang,Luke J. Huang,Chengyue Wu,Shang Yang,Kelly Peng,Yao Lu,Song Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) 通过灵活的并行自回归建模和局部感知生成顺序，显著加速自回归图像生成，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归图像生成依赖顺序预测，导致高延迟。现有方法尝试并行化但效果有限，LPD旨在实现高并行化且不牺牲质量。

Method: 引入灵活并行自回归建模（支持任意生成顺序和并行度）和局部感知生成顺序（最小化组内依赖，最大化上下文支持）。

Result: 在ImageNet类条件生成中，将生成步骤从256降至20（256×256分辨率）和1024降至48（512×512分辨率），延迟降低至少3.4倍。

Conclusion: LPD通过创新架构和调度策略，显著提升自回归图像生成的效率和性能。

Abstract: We present Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) to accelerate
autoregressive image generation. Traditional autoregressive image generation
relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high
latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by
shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved
limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining
generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized
Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation
ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query
tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility
among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2)
Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to
minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing
generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256
to 20 (256$\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\times$512 res.) without
compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and
achieving at least 3.4$\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized
autoregressive models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthSync提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过扩散引导实现长视频的尺度和几何一致深度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时存在尺度不一致和几何预测不准确的问题。

Method: 引入尺度引导和几何引导，协同优化去噪过程。

Result: 实验验证了DepthSync在长视频中提升深度预测的一致性和准确性。

Conclusion: DepthSync为长视频深度估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video depth estimation methods have achieved remarkable
success with strong generalization ability. However, predicting depth for long
videos remains challenging. Existing methods typically split videos into
overlapping sliding windows, leading to accumulated scale discrepancies across
different windows, particularly as the number of windows increases.
Additionally, these methods rely solely on 2D diffusion priors, overlooking the
inherent 3D geometric structure of video depths, which results in geometrically
inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose DepthSync, a novel,
training-free framework using diffusion guidance to achieve scale- and
geometry-consistent depth predictions for long videos. Specifically, we
introduce scale guidance to synchronize the depth scale across windows and
geometry guidance to enforce geometric alignment within windows based on the
inherent 3D constraints in video depths. These two terms work synergistically,
steering the denoising process toward consistent depth predictions. Experiments
on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in producing depth
estimates with improved scale and geometry consistency, particularly for long
videos.

TL;DR: POLC提出了一种感知导向的潜在编码方法，通过丰富潜在特征的语义内容，提升压缩域语义推理性能，同时减少微调参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于MSE优化的图像编码模型潜在空间语义有限，且微调计算成本高。

Method: 采用感知导向的潜在编码（POLC），仅需插入适配器进行微调。

Result: POLC在视觉任务中表现优异，且微调开销极小。

Conclusion: POLC在压缩域语义推理中实现了高性能与低计算成本的平衡。

Abstract: In recent years, compressed domain semantic inference has primarily relied on
learned image coding models optimized for mean squared error (MSE). However,
MSE-oriented optimization tends to yield latent spaces with limited semantic
richness, which hinders effective semantic inference in downstream tasks.
Moreover, achieving high performance with these models often requires
fine-tuning the entire vision model, which is computationally intensive,
especially for large models. To address these problems, we introduce
Perception-Oriented Latent Coding (POLC), an approach that enriches the
semantic content of latent features for high-performance compressed domain
semantic inference. With the semantically rich latent space, POLC requires only
a plug-and-play adapter for fine-tuning, significantly reducing the parameter
count compared to previous MSE-oriented methods. Experimental results
demonstrate that POLC achieves rate-perception performance comparable to
state-of-the-art generative image coding methods while markedly enhancing
performance in vision tasks, with minimal fine-tuning overhead. Code is
available at https://github.com/NJUVISION/POLC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAILViT是一种逐步特征学习的ViT，用于提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂交互中的性能，通过粗到细的特征对齐和知识注入实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ViTs因参数初始化冲突和模态语义差距难以与LLMs直接协同训练，限制了MLLMs的性能。

Method: 提出SAILViT，采用逐步特征细化实现特征对齐和知识注入。

Result: SAILViT在OpenCompass基准测试中显著提升MLLMs性能，展现强大鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: SAILViT有效解决了ViTs与LLMs协同训练的挑战，为MLLMs性能提升提供了新途径。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential as foundation backbones in
establishing the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although most ViTs achieve impressive performance through
image-text pair-based contrastive learning or self-supervised mechanisms, they
struggle to engage in connector-based co-training directly with LLMs due to
potential parameter initialization conflicts and modality semantic gaps. To
address the above challenges, this paper proposes SAILViT, a gradual feature
learning-enhanced ViT for facilitating MLLMs to break through performance
bottlenecks in complex multimodal interactions. SAILViT achieves
coarse-to-fine-grained feature alignment and world knowledge infusion with
gradual feature refinement, which better serves target training demands. We
perform thorough empirical analyses to confirm the powerful robustness and
generalizability of SAILViT across different dimensions, including parameter
sizes, model architectures, training strategies, and data scales. Equipped with
SAILViT, existing MLLMs show significant and consistent performance
improvements on the OpenCompass benchmark across extensive downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下，立体匹配模型因训练数据稀缺和特征提取困难而表现不佳，RobuSTereo旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 提出基于扩散的模拟管道，生成高质量合成数据；2. 设计结合ConvNet和去噪Transformer的鲁棒特征编码器。

Result: 实验表明，RobuSTereo显著提升了模型在多样恶劣天气场景中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: RobuSTereo通过数据增强和特征提取优化，有效解决了恶劣天气下立体匹配的挑战。

Abstract: Learning-based stereo matching models struggle in adverse weather conditions
due to the scarcity of corresponding training data and the challenges in
extracting discriminative features from degraded images. These limitations
significantly hinder zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution weather
conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RobuSTereo}, a novel framework
that enhances the zero-shot generalization of stereo matching models under
adverse weather by addressing both data scarcity and feature extraction
challenges. First, we introduce a diffusion-based simulation pipeline with a
stereo consistency module, which generates high-quality stereo data tailored
for adverse conditions. By training stereo matching models on our synthetic
datasets, we reduce the domain gap between clean and degraded images,
significantly improving the models' robustness to unseen weather conditions.
The stereo consistency module ensures structural alignment across synthesized
image pairs, preserving geometric integrity and enhancing depth estimation
accuracy. Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a
specialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable
features from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local
structures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations,
effectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced
distortions. This enables more accurate disparity estimation even under
challenging visual conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textbf{RobuSTereo} significantly improves the robustness and generalization of
stereo matching models across diverse adverse weather scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SPoT的新型标记化策略，通过连续放置标记来避免网格限制，显著提升性能并减少推理所需的标记数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准标记化方法将特征限制在离散的网格中，限制了模型在稀疏场景下的潜力，需要妥协。

Method: 提出Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT)，通过连续放置标记和基于oracle的搜索优化位置。

Result: 实验表明，SPoT能显著提升性能，并大幅减少推理所需的标记数量。

Conclusion: SPoT为ViT架构提供了灵活、高效和可解释的新方向，将稀疏性转化为战略优势。

Abstract: Vision Transformers naturally accommodate sparsity, yet standard tokenization
methods confine features to discrete patch grids. This constraint prevents
models from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We
propose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that
positions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping
grid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover
substantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning,
drastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions
during inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and
interpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage
rather than an imposed limitation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索图像目标导航任务是否可以通过端到端强化学习高效解决，以验证是否仅通过导航奖励就能训练相对姿态估计能力。

Method: 通过大规模研究分析不同架构选择（如延迟融合、通道堆叠、空间到深度投影和交叉注意力）对导航训练中相对姿态估计能力的影响。

Result: 研究发现模拟器设置会影响近期方法的成功，但部分能力可迁移到更现实的场景中，并发现导航性能与相对姿态估计能力相关。

Conclusion: 端到端强化学习可以部分解决图像目标导航任务，但模拟器设置和架构选择对性能有显著影响。

Abstract: Image goal navigation requires two different skills: firstly, core navigation
skills, including the detection of free space and obstacles, and taking
decisions based on an internal representation; and secondly, computing
directional information by comparing visual observations to the goal image.
Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or
pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this
paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end
training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive
answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose
estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate
the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking,
space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence
of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success
of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings,
leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these
capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend.
We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and
probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进精度，并成功扩展到4D微表情识别。

Conclusion: FACET-VLM为多模态面部表情识别提供了强大、可扩展且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in 3D and 4D domains presents a
significant challenge in affective computing due to the complexity of spatial
and temporal facial dynamics. Its success is crucial for advancing applications
in human behavior understanding, healthcare monitoring, and human-computer
interaction. In this work, we propose FACET-VLM, a vision-language framework
for 3D/4D FER that integrates multiview facial representation learning with
semantic guidance from natural language prompts. FACET-VLM introduces three key
components: Cross-View Semantic Aggregation (CVSA) for view-consistent fusion,
Multiview Text-Guided Fusion (MTGF) for semantically aligned facial emotions,
and a multiview consistency loss to enforce structural coherence across views.
Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks,
including BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous. We further extend
FACET-VLM to 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) on the 4DME dataset,
demonstrating strong performance in capturing subtle, short-lived emotional
cues. The extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and
substantial contributions of each individual component within the framework.
Overall, FACET-VLM offers a robust, extensible, and high-performing solution
for multimodal FER in both posed and spontaneous settings.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义类别数量的刚性假设，限制了处理真实数据复杂性的能力。

Method: 提出AdaGCD框架，结合自适应槽注意力（AdaSlot）动态确定最佳槽数，实现灵活聚类。

Result: 在公开和细粒度数据集上的实验验证了AdaGCD的有效性，特别是在利用空间局部信息方面。

Conclusion: AdaGCD通过自适应表示和动态槽分配，显著提升了开放世界场景中的类别发现能力。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) tackles the challenging problem of
categorizing unlabeled images into both known and novel classes within a
partially labeled dataset, without prior knowledge of the number of unknown
categories. Traditional methods often rely on rigid assumptions, such as
predefining the number of classes, which limits their ability to handle the
inherent variability and complexity of real-world data. To address these
shortcomings, we propose AdaGCD, a cluster-centric contrastive learning
framework that incorporates Adaptive Slot Attention (AdaSlot) into the GCD
framework. AdaSlot dynamically determines the optimal number of slots based on
data complexity, removing the need for predefined slot counts. This adaptive
mechanism facilitates the flexible clustering of unlabeled data into known and
novel categories by dynamically allocating representational capacity. By
integrating adaptive representation with dynamic slot allocation, our method
captures both instance-specific and spatially clustered features, improving
class discovery in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on public and
fine-grained datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, emphasizing
the advantages of leveraging spatial local information for category discovery
in unlabeled image datasets.

Result: 实验表明，该方法检测精度更高，处理速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 小波域指纹提取方法简化了流程，提高了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Camera fingerprint detection plays a crucial role in source identification
and image forensics, with wavelet denoising approaches proving to be
particularly effective in extracting sensor pattern noise (SPN). In this
article, we propose a modification to wavelet-based SPN extraction. Rather than
constructing the fingerprint as an image, we introduce the notion of a wavelet
domain fingerprint. This avoids the final inversion step of the denoising
algorithm and allows fingerprint comparisons to be made directly in the wavelet
domain. As such, our modification streamlines the extraction and comparison
process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method not only achieves higher detection accuracy but can also significantly
improve processing speed.

Result: 软自标记显著提升了基于涂鸦标签的训练效果，甚至优于完全像素级监督，且适用于其他弱监督问题。

Conclusion: 软自标记是一种有效的弱监督分割方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We consider weakly supervised segmentation where only a fraction of pixels
have ground truth labels (scribbles) and focus on a self-labeling approach
optimizing relaxations of the standard unsupervised CRF/Potts loss on unlabeled
pixels. While WSSS methods can directly optimize such losses via gradient
descent, prior work suggests that higher-order optimization can improve network
training by introducing hidden pseudo-labels and powerful CRF sub-problem
solvers, e.g. graph cut. However, previously used hard pseudo-labels can not
represent class uncertainty or errors, which motivates soft self-labeling. We
derive a principled auxiliary loss and systematically evaluate standard and new
CRF relaxations (convex and non-convex), neighborhood systems, and terms
connecting network predictions with soft pseudo-labels. We also propose a
general continuous sub-problem solver. Using only standard architectures, soft
self-labeling consistently improves scribble-based training and outperforms
significantly more complex specialized WSSS systems. It can outperform full
pixel-precise supervision. Our general ideas apply to other weakly-supervised
problems/systems.

Conclusion: 剪枝对视觉表示的影响复杂，需进一步研究其适用条件和方式。

Abstract: Pruning is widely used to reduce the complexity of deep learning models, but
its effects on interpretability and representation learning remain poorly
understood. This paper investigates how pruning influences vision models across
three key dimensions: (i) interpretability, (ii) unsupervised object discovery,
and (iii) alignment with human perception. We first analyze different vision
network architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature
attribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning
promotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving
unsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while
preserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the
alignment between model representations and human perception, investigating
whether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to
humans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse
models exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human
alignment. However, these spots highly depend on the network architectures and
their size in terms of trainable parameters. Our results suggest a complex
interplay between these three dimensions, highlighting the importance of
investigating when and how pruning benefits vision representations.

Conclusion: HOI-Dyn在生成3D人-物交互中表现出色，同时保持了推理效率。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remains a
challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction
dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently,
resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In
this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation
as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At
the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics
model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To
further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that
mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading
optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training,
preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of
HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the
quality of generated interactions.

Result: DeRIS在非参考和多参考场景中表现出色，无需专门架构修改。

Conclusion: DeRIS通过模块化分析和创新机制提升了RIS任务的性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that aims to segment
objects in an image based on natural language expressions. While prior studies
have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and
achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental
bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key
components: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a
systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our
findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual
deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current
models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which
enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby
enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text
comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent
sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue
related to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS
demonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios
without requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its
general applicability. The codes and models are available at

Motivation: ViTs在自然图像领域表现优异，但在3D医学图像分割中应用较少。IAC作为神经血管疾病的生物标志物，其自动化量化对大规模风险评估具有重要意义。

Method: 通过MAE框架对ViTs进行自监督预训练，并在IST-3临床试验数据上进行微调，用于IAC分割。研究了ViTs的关键参数设置。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant popularity in the natural
image domain but have been less successful in 3D medical image segmentation.
Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging
volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked
autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the
need for expensive manual annotations. intracranial arterial calcification
(IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to
neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC
quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train
ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To
develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical
trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of
MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical
implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong
supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial
for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular
convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and
3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk
group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%. Our code is available
online.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种自监督多模态预训练技术和一种新型混合模型架构，用于从SAR图像中提取冰川崩解前沿位置，显著提升了监测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰川冰量流失加剧，需精准监测崩解前沿以理解崩解过程，但现有基于ImageNet预训练的模型因领域差异表现不佳。

Method: 提出自监督多模态预训练技术，利用新数据集SSL4SAR，并结合Swin Transformer编码器和残差CNN解码器的混合架构。

Result: 模型在CaFFe数据集上平均距离误差为293米，优于之前最佳模型67米；集成模型误差降至75米，接近人类水平（38米）。

Conclusion: 该技术显著提升了冰川崩解前沿的季节性变化监测精度。

Abstract: Glaciers are losing ice mass at unprecedented rates, increasing the need for
accurate, year-round monitoring to understand frontal ablation, particularly
the factors driving the calving process. Deep learning models can extract
calving front positions from Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to track seasonal
ice losses at the calving fronts of marine- and lake-terminating glaciers. The
current state-of-the-art model relies on ImageNet-pretrained weights. However,
they are suboptimal due to the domain shift between the natural images in
ImageNet and the specialized characteristics of remote sensing imagery, in
particular for Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. To address this challenge, we
propose two novel self-supervised multimodal pretraining techniques that
leverage SSL4SAR, a new unlabeled dataset comprising 9,563 Sentinel-1 and 14
Sentinel-2 images of Arctic glaciers, with one optical image per glacier in the
dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid model architecture that
combines a Swin Transformer encoder with a residual Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) decoder. When pretrained on SSL4SAR, this model achieves a mean
distance error of 293 m on the "CAlving Fronts and where to Find thEm" (CaFFe)
benchmark dataset, outperforming the prior best model by 67 m. Evaluating an
ensemble of the proposed model on a multi-annotator study of the benchmark
dataset reveals a mean distance error of 75 m, approaching the human
performance of 38 m. This advancement enables precise monitoring of seasonal
changes in glacier calving fronts.

TL;DR: 论文提出DisCon框架，通过将离散标记作为条件信号而非生成目标，解决了连续标记建模的优化挑战，同时避免了量化带来的信息损失。


<details>

Motivation: 解决基于自回归的视觉生成模型中量化过程导致的信息损失问题，并探索连续标记预测的挑战。

Method: 引入DisCon框架，将离散标记作为条件信号，建模连续表示的条件概率。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256生成任务上，DisCon的gFID得分为1.38，优于现有自回归方法。

Conclusion: DisCon通过结合离散和连续表示的优势，显著提升了图像生成的保真度。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interests in
encoding images as discrete tokens and leveraging autoregressive (AR)
frameworks for visual generation. However, the quantization process in AR-based
visual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades
image fidelity. To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to
autoregressively predict continuous tokens. Unlike discrete tokens that reside
in a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an
unbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging
and increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts. Based on
the above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned
Continuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete
tokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets. By modeling the
conditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete
tokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token
modeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization. DisCon
achieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 generation,
outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches by a clear margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的分段高斯金字塔（SGP）攻击方法，通过多尺度图像处理增强对抗样本的可迁移性，显著提高了对黑盒防御模型的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗样本的可迁移性对深度神经网络构成安全威胁，现有方法通常仅关注单尺度图像，限制了攻击效果。

Method: 采用高斯滤波和三种下采样方法构建多尺度样本，计算各尺度损失函数的梯度并取平均以确定对抗扰动。

Result: 实验表明，SGP显著提高了攻击成功率，平均提升幅度为2.3%至32.6%。

Conclusion: SGP是一种高扩展性的输入变换方法，可轻松集成到现有攻击中，有效增强对抗样本的可迁移性。

Abstract: The transferability of adversarial examples poses a significant security
challenge for deep neural networks, which can be attacked without knowing
anything about them. In this paper, we propose a new Segmented Gaussian Pyramid
(SGP) attack method to enhance the transferability, particularly against
defense models. Unlike existing methods that generally focus on single-scale
images, our approach employs Gaussian filtering and three types of downsampling
to construct a series of multi-scale examples. Then, the gradients of the loss
function with respect to each scale are computed, and their average is used to
determine the adversarial perturbations. The proposed SGP can be considered an
input transformation with high extensibility that is easily integrated into
most existing adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in
contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, SGP significantly enhances attack
success rates against black-box defense models, with average attack success
rates increasing by 2.3% to 32.6%, based only on transferability.

TL;DR: FreeLoRA提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过融合多个特定主题的LoRA模块实现多主题个性化图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多主题个性化生成中存在复杂调整或联合优化的问题，FreeLoRA旨在简化这一过程。

Method: 采用Full Token Tuning策略对每个主题的LoRA模块进行适配，并在推理时通过Subject-Aware Inference激活对应模块。

Result: 实验表明FreeLoRA在主题保真度和提示一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: FreeLoRA为多主题个性化图像生成提供了一种简单且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation plays a crucial role in applications such as
virtual try-on and poster design. Existing approaches typically fine-tune
pretrained generative models or apply LoRA-based adaptations for individual
subjects. However, these methods struggle with multi-subject personalization,
as combining independently adapted modules often requires complex re-tuning or
joint optimization. We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework
that enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for
multi-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a
specific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across
all tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content
alignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each
module only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free
fusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while
mitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive
experiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject
fidelity and prompt consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D VQA模型仅监督最终输出，可能导致模型通过浅层捷径学习，缺乏对推理路径的监督。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效确保模型开发合理的推理路径，并提升性能。

Conclusion: HCNQA通过分层监督改善了3D VQA模型的推理能力，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question-Answering (3D VQA) is pivotal for models to perceive the
physical world and perform spatial reasoning. Answer-centric supervision is a
commonly used training method for 3D VQA models. Many models that utilize this
strategy have achieved promising results in 3D VQA tasks. However, the
answer-centric approach only supervises the final output of models and allows
models to develop reasoning pathways freely. The absence of supervision on the
reasoning pathway enables the potential for developing superficial shortcuts
through common patterns in question-answer pairs. Moreover, although
slow-thinking methods advance large language models, they suffer from
underthinking. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{HCNQA}, a 3D VQA
model leveraging a hierarchical concentration narrowing supervision method. By
mimicking the human process of gradually focusing from a broad area to specific
objects while searching for answers, our method guides the model to perform
three phases of concentration narrowing through hierarchical supervision. By
supervising key checkpoints on a general reasoning pathway, our method can
ensure the development of a rational and effective reasoning pathway. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure that
the model develops a rational reasoning pathway and performs better. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常仅依赖基础模型的预测误差，忽视了长尾轨迹模式的多样性和不确定性，导致复杂和危险场景的预测能力不足。

Method: 结合改进的动量对比学习（MoCo-DT）和解耦对比学习（DCL）模块，设计四种轨迹随机增强方法，并引入在线迭代聚类策略。

Result: 在nuScenes和ETH/UCY数据集上，AMD在长尾轨迹预测和整体预测准确性方面均表现最优。

Conclusion: AMD框架有效提升了模型对复杂和罕见轨迹的识别能力，为自动驾驶中的轨迹预测提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is essential
in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory
distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and
hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's
prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of
long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled
contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and
supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum
contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module,
our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex
trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random
augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy,
allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the
distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to
define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on
the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only
achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also
demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: 多视角光谱滤镜结合消费级硬件可实现更准确、实用的超光谱成像解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR) from RGB images is a fundamentally
ill-posed problem due to severe spectral information loss. Existing approaches
typically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this
work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR)
framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses
are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration,
grounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse
spectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this
new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising
aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference
camera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves
consistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark.
In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra
compared to an ordinary RGB camera. Our findings suggest that multi-view
spectral filtering with commodity hardware can unlock more accurate and
practical hyperspectral imaging solutions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep neural networks have driven significant progress
in image enhancement (IE). However, deploying deep learning models on
resource-constrained platforms, such as mobile devices, remains challenging due

Result: 在多个手术数据库中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 无监督对象中心方法可应用于现实世界数据，并成为医疗应用中的常见工具。

Abstract: Object-centric slot attention is an emerging paradigm for unsupervised
learning of structured, interpretable object-centric representations (slots).
This enables effective reasoning about objects and events at a low
computational cost and is thus applicable to critical healthcare applications,
such as real-time interpretation of surgical video. The heterogeneous scenes in
real-world applications like surgery are, however, difficult to parse into a
meaningful set of slots. Current approaches with an adaptive slot count perform
well on images, but their performance on surgical videos is low. To address
this challenge, we propose a dynamic temporal slot transformer (DTST) module
that is trained both for temporal reasoning and for predicting the optimal
future slot initialization. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple surgical databases, demonstrating that unsupervised object-centric
methods can be applied to real-world data and become part of the common arsenal
in healthcare applications.

Result: 在Semi-LReID基准测试中，SPRED实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SPRED通过自增强循环设计，显著提升了半监督终身行人重识别的性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current lifelong person re-identification (LReID) methods predominantly rely
on fully labeled data streams. However, in real-world scenarios where
annotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with
scarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)
problem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing
LReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from
limited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy
knowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we
pioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing
Prototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key
innovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic
prototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative
purification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically,
learnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the
identity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the
dual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and
historical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this
cyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve
current-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term
learning. Experiments on the established Semi-LReID benchmarks show that our
SPRED achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理复杂隐式假设指令，缺乏支持推理的数据集和细粒度细节提取机制。

Method: 提出Reason50K数据集和ReasonBrain框架，结合多模态大语言模型和扩散模型，引入细粒度推理线索提取模块和跨模态增强器。

Result: ReasonBrain在推理场景中表现优异，并具备零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Reason50K和ReasonBrain为复杂指令推理图像编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success
of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and
explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting,
moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit
hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible
visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited
support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities.
Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail
extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we
propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and
evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with
ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit
hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K
samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and
Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis,
incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture
detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction
reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal
Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and
MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios
while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our
dataset and code will be released publicly.

Motivation: 临床实施DIR需要基于体素的空间精度指标，但胃肠道器官的高移动性使得手动标记点难以实现。因此，需要一种更有效的方法来评估DIR的准确性。

Method: 通过半自动化管道，从静态3D患者扫描生成21个模拟GI运动的4D序列数字孪生，并利用这些DT评估6种DIR方法的性能，包括目标配准误差、Dice相似系数和Hausdorff距离等指标。

Result: 生成的DT模拟了真实的GI运动，运动幅度与真实患者数据相似，并提供了详细的DIR性能指标和剂量映射准确性的验证。

Conclusion: 该管道为动态且解剖复杂的区域提供了严格的DIR工具测试方法，实现了空间和剂量精度的详细评估。

Abstract: Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR)
requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified
landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile
gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins
(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of
DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D
sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published
analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,
including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,
and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were
assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from
independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six
different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity
coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics
and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans
from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were
warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of
DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error
estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling
realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean
log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to
published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of
detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose
mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR
tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and
dosimetric accuracies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种信息融合框架，结合多季节结构数据，支持果园自动化管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园自动化中，茂密的树冠会遮挡树干和树枝，限制了机器视觉系统的能力。休眠季节时树冠结构更开放，适合数据采集。

Method: 使用YOLOv9-Seg进行实例分割，Kinect Fusion进行3D重建，Fast GICP进行模型对齐，融合休眠期和生长期的数据。

Result: YOLOv9-Seg的MSE为0.0047，mAP@50为0.78；Kinect Fusion的RMSE为5.23 mm（树干直径）；Fast GICP的配准分数为0.00197。

Conclusion: 融合多季节数据可提升果园自动化操作的精度，如修剪和疏果。

Abstract: In orchard automation, dense foliage during the canopy season severely
occludes tree structures, minimizing visibility to various canopy parts such as
trunks and branches, which limits the ability of a machine vision system.
However, canopy structure is more open and visible during the dormant season
when trees are defoliated. In this work, we present an information fusion
framework that integrates multi-seasonal structural data to support robotic and
automated crop load management during the entire growing season. The framework
combines high-resolution RGB-D imagery from both dormant and canopy periods
using YOLOv9-Seg for instance segmentation, Kinect Fusion for 3D
reconstruction, and Fast Generalized Iterative Closest Point (Fast GICP) for
model alignment. Segmentation outputs from YOLOv9-Seg were used to extract
depth-informed masks, which enabled accurate 3D point cloud reconstruction via
Kinect Fusion; these reconstructed models from each season were subsequently
aligned using Fast GICP to achieve spatially coherent multi-season fusion. The
YOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared
error (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in
dormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree
geometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square
errors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and
13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal
registration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated,
comprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the
growing season. This fused structural representation enables robotic systems to
access otherwise obscured architectural information, improving the precision of
pruning, thinning, and other automated orchard operations.

scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified
framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image
customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference
images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal
attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the
In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented
register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to
correctly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in
polyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a
high-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world
sources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and
over-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial
applications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and
creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench
and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly
outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art
open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human
preference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment
metrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters. Project

TL;DR: evMLP是一种基于事件驱动的多层感知机架构，通过选择性处理图像或特征图中的变化区域，提升计算效率，同时保持与基准模型相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多层感知机（MLPs）在视觉任务中的应用，并通过事件驱动机制优化计算性能。

Method: 提出evMLP，结合事件驱动的局部更新机制，仅处理连续帧间发生变化的图像块。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中表现优异，视频数据集上显著降低计算成本且保持输出一致性。

Conclusion: evMLP为视觉模型架构提供了高效且轻量化的新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results in computer vision
tasks. In the early days, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were the
mainstream architecture. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
become increasingly popular. In addition, exploring applications of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) has provided new perspectives for research into vision model
architectures. In this paper, we present evMLP accompanied by a simple
event-driven local update mechanism. The proposed evMLP can independently
process patches on images or feature maps via MLPs. We define changes between
consecutive frames as "events". Under the event-driven local update mechanism,
evMLP selectively processes patches where events occur. For sequential image
data (e.g., video processing), this approach improves computational performance
by avoiding redundant computations. Through ImageNet image classification
experiments, evMLP attains accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art models.
More significantly, experimental results on multiple video datasets demonstrate
that evMLP reduces computational cost via its event-driven local update
mechanism while maintaining output consistency with its non-event-driven
baseline. The code and trained models are available at

Motivation: 现有公开数据集仅包含孤立的文本-视频对，无法支持连贯多场景视频序列的建模。

Method: 提出CI-VID数据集，包含34万样本，每个样本为连贯视频片段序列，附带文本描述。设计多维基准验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，基于CI-VID训练的模型在生成视频序列时，准确性和内容一致性显著提升。

Conclusion: CI-VID数据集支持生成具有视觉平滑过渡和时间连贯性的故事驱动内容，具有高质量和实用价值。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has recently attracted considerable attention,
resulting in the development of numerous high-quality datasets that have
propelled progress in this area. However, existing public datasets are
primarily composed of isolated text-video (T-V) pairs and thus fail to support
the modeling of coherent multi-clip video sequences. To address this
limitation, we introduce CI-VID, a dataset that moves beyond isolated
text-to-video (T2V) generation toward text-and-video-to-video (TV2V)
generation, enabling models to produce coherent, multi-scene video sequences.
CI-VID contains over 340,000 samples, each featuring a coherent sequence of
video clips with text captions that capture both the individual content of each
clip and the transitions between them, enabling visually and textually grounded
generation. To further validate the effectiveness of CI-VID, we design a
comprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark incorporating human evaluation,
VLM-based assessment, and similarity-based metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate that models trained on CI-VID exhibit significant improvements in
both accuracy and content consistency when generating video sequences. This
facilitates the creation of story-driven content with smooth visual transitions
and strong temporal coherence, underscoring the quality and practical utility
of the CI-VID dataset We release the CI-VID dataset and the accompanying code
for data construction and evaluation at: https://github.com/ymju-BAAI/CI-VID

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LongAnimation的新框架，用于解决长动画着色中的长期颜色一致性问题，通过动态全局-局部范式实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长动画着色在动画产业中成本高昂，现有方法局限于短期着色且忽视全局信息，无法保持长期颜色一致性。

Method: 提出LongAnimation框架，包括SketchDiT、动态全局-局部记忆模块（DGLM）和颜色一致性奖励机制，动态融合全局与局部特征。

Result: 在短期（14帧）和长期（平均500帧）动画上的实验表明，LongAnimation能有效保持颜色一致性。

Conclusion: LongAnimation通过动态全局-局部范式显著提升了长动画着色的颜色一致性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry
production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,
automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has
significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term
colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features
to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local
paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color
consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can
be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically
extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.
Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly
includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color
Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support
the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to
dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with
the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce
a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency
fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both
short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the
effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color
consistency for open-domain animation colorization task. The code can be found

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在静态图像上表现优秀，但在动态、信息密集的短视频理解上不足。

Method: 采用四阶段预训练和两阶段后训练，包括创新的五模式数据混合和强化学习。

Result: 在公共视频基准测试中达到SOTA，通用图像任务上保持竞争力，并开发了新基准KC-MMBench。

Conclusion: Keye-VL填补了短视频理解的空白，并通过创新方法实现了高性能。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic,
information-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in today's digital
landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an
8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge
performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust
general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on
two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens
with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe
features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,
followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first
post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction
following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In
this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data
mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think
with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to
decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and
alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct
abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,
we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves
state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly
competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop
and release the \textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world
short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练扩散模型的微调，受限于时间和语义/布局差异，FreeMorph旨在无需实例训练即可实现高保真图像变形。

Method: 1) 提出指导感知的球形插值设计，通过修改自注意力模块解决身份丢失问题；2) 引入步骤导向的变分趋势，混合输入图像的自注意力模块以实现可控过渡。

Result: FreeMorph在图像变形任务中表现优异，速度提升10x~50x，成为新的SOTA方法。

Conclusion: FreeMorph通过创新的自注意力模块设计，解决了现有方法的局限性，为图像变形提供了高效、高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We present FreeMorph, the first tuning-free method for image morphing that
accommodates inputs with different semantics or layouts. Unlike existing
methods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by
time constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers
high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite
their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in
maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step
denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In
this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating
two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical
interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images
by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and
ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We
further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention
modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent
transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate
that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and
establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在移动设备上因资源限制难以应用，MobileRAG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合EcoVector（移动友好向量搜索算法）和SCR（选择性内容缩减方法），优化内存和计算资源。

Result: 在延迟、内存使用和功耗方面显著优于传统方法，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: MobileRAG为资源受限环境下的隐私保护和离线操作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective on server
infrastructures, but its application on mobile devices is still underexplored
due to limited memory and power resources. Existing vector search and RAG
solutions largely assume abundant computation resources, making them
impractical for on-device scenarios. In this paper, we propose MobileRAG, a
fully on-device pipeline that overcomes these limitations by combining a
mobile-friendly vector search algorithm, \textit{EcoVector}, with a lightweight
\textit{Selective Content Reduction} (SCR) method. By partitioning and
partially loading index data, EcoVector drastically reduces both memory
footprint and CPU usage, while the SCR method filters out irrelevant text to
diminish Language Model (LM) input size without degrading accuracy. Extensive
experiments demonstrated that MobileRAG significantly outperforms conventional
vector search and RAG methods in terms of latency, memory usage, and power
consumption, while maintaining accuracy and enabling offline operation to
safeguard privacy in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: In Complex Event Processing, handling out-of-order, late, and duplicate
events is critical for real-time analytics, especially on resource-constrained
devices that process heterogeneous data from multiple sources. We present
LimeCEP, a hybrid CEP approach that combines lazy evaluation, buffering, and
speculative processing to efficiently handle data inconsistencies while
supporting multi-pattern detection under relaxed semantics. LimeCEP integrates
Kafka for efficient message ordering, retention, and duplicate elimination, and
offers configurable strategies to trade off between accuracy, latency, and
resource consumption. Compared to state-of-the-art systems like SASE and
FlinkCEP, LimeCEP achieves up to six orders of magnitude lower latency, with up
to 10 times lower memory usage and 6 times lower CPU utilization, while
maintaining near-perfect precision and recall under high-disorder input
streams, making it well-suited for non-cloud deployments.

Method: 提出'Data Agent'架构，整合知识理解、推理和规划能力，解决数据相关任务，并探讨设计中的挑战（如理解数据/查询/环境/工具、协调流程、优化执行等）。

Result: 展示了多种数据代理系统实例（如数据科学代理、数据分析代理、DBA代理等），并指出设计中的开放挑战。

Conclusion: 'Data Agent'有望通过LLMs技术革新Data+AI系统，但需进一步解决设计中的挑战。

Abstract: Traditional Data+AI systems utilize data-driven techniques to optimize
performance, but they rely heavily on human experts to orchestrate system
pipelines, enabling them to adapt to changes in data, queries, tasks, and
environments. For instance, while there are numerous data science tools
available, developing a pipeline planning system to coordinate these tools
remains challenging. This difficulty arises because existing Data+AI systems
have limited capabilities in semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning.
Fortunately, we have witnessed the success of large language models (LLMs) in
enhancing semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning abilities. It is
crucial to incorporate LLM techniques to revolutionize data systems for
orchestrating Data+AI applications effectively.
  To achieve this, we propose the concept of a 'Data Agent' - a comprehensive
architecture designed to orchestrate Data+AI ecosystems, which focuses on
tackling data-related tasks by integrating knowledge comprehension, reasoning,
and planning capabilities. We delve into the challenges involved in designing
data agents, such as understanding data/queries/environments/tools,
orchestrating pipelines/workflows, optimizing and executing pipelines, and
fostering pipeline self-reflection. Furthermore, we present examples of data
agent systems, including a data science agent, data analytics agents (such as
unstructured data analytics agent, semantic structured data analytics agent,
data lake analytics agent, and multi-modal data analytics agent), and a
database administrator (DBA) agent. We also outline several open challenges
associated with designing data agent systems.

Conclusion: SOS加速器为异构计算系统提供了一种高效、可扩展的调度解决方案，适用于高性能计算和深度学习等关键应用。

Abstract: Efficient workload scheduling is a critical challenge in modern heterogeneous
computing environments, particularly in high-performance computing (HPC)
systems. Traditional software-based schedulers struggle to efficiently balance
workload distribution due to high scheduling overhead, lack of adaptability to
dynamic workloads, and suboptimal resource utilization. These pitfalls are
compounded in heterogeneous systems, where differing computational elements can
have vastly different performance profiles. To resolve these hindrances, we
present a novel FPGA-based accelerator for stochastic online scheduling (SOS).
We modify a greedy cost selection assignment policy by adapting existing cost
equations to engage with discretized time before implementing them into a
hardware accelerator design. Our design leverages hardware parallelism,
precalculation, and precision quantization to reduce job scheduling latency. By
introducing a hardware-accelerated approach to real-time scheduling, this paper
establishes a new paradigm for adaptive scheduling mechanisms in heterogeneous
computing systems. The proposed design achieves high throughput, low latency,
and energy-efficient operation, offering a scalable alternative to traditional
software scheduling methods. Experimental results demonstrate consistent
workload distribution, fair machine utilization, and up to 1060x speedup over
single-threaded software scheduling policy implementations. This makes the SOS
accelerator a strong candidate for deployment in high-performance computing
system, deeplearning pipelines, and other performance-critical applications.

Conclusion: FLARE显著提升了HPC系统中科学数据压缩的性能和能效，为大规模科学计算提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific simulation leveraging high-performance computing (HPC) systems is
crucial for modeling complex systems and phenomena in fields such as
astrophysics, climate science, and fluid dynamics, generating massive datasets
that often reach petabyte to exabyte scales. However, managing these vast data
volumes introduces significant I/O and network bottlenecks, limiting practical
performance and scalability. While cutting-edge lossy compression frameworks
powered by deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated superior compression
ratios by capturing complex data correlations, their integration into HPC
workflows poses substantial challenges due to the hybrid non-neural and neural
computation patterns, causing excessive memory access overhead, large
sequential stalls, and limited adaptability to varying data sizes and workloads
in existing hardware platforms. To overcome these challenges and push the limit
of high-performance scientific computing, we for the first time propose FLARE,
a dataflow-aware and scalable hardware architecture for neural-hybrid
scientific lossy compression. FLARE minimizes off-chip data access, reduces
bubble overhead through efficient dataflow, and adopts a modular design that
provides both scalability and flexibility, significantly enhancing throughput
and energy efficiency on modern HPC systems. Particularly, the proposed FLARE
achieves runtime speedups ranging from $3.50 \times$ to $96.07 \times$, and
energy efficiency improvements ranging from $24.51 \times$ to $520.68 \times$,
across various datasets and hardware platforms.

Abstract: Organizations around the world schedule jobs (programs) regularly to perform
various tasks dictated by their end users. With the major movement towards
using a cloud computing infrastructure, our organization follows a hybrid
approach with both cloud and on-prem servers. The objective of this work is to
perform capacity planning, i.e., estimate resource requirements, and job
scheduling for on-prem grid computing environments. A key contribution of our
approach is handling uncertainty in both resource usage and duration of the
jobs, a critical aspect in the finance industry where stochastic market
conditions significantly influence job characteristics. For capacity planning
and scheduling, we simultaneously balance two conflicting objectives: (a)
minimize resource usage, and (b) provide high quality-of-service to the end
users by completing jobs by their requested deadlines. We propose approximate
approaches using deterministic estimators and pair sampling-based constraint
programming. Our best approach (pair sampling-based) achieves much lower peak
resource usage compared to manual scheduling without compromising on the
quality-of-service.

Result: 首次在异步设置中实现了最优O(k)时间复杂度的分散算法，且内存使用为O(log(k+Δ))位。

Conclusion: 本文填补了异步设置中的复杂性差距，提出的算法在时间和内存上均达到最优。

Abstract: We study the dispersion problem in anonymous port-labeled graphs: $k \leq n$
mobile agents, each with a unique ID and initially located arbitrarily on the
nodes of an $n$-node graph with maximum degree $\Delta$, must autonomously
relocate so that no node hosts more than one agent. Dispersion serves as a
fundamental task in distributed computing of mobile agents, and its complexity
stems from key challenges in local coordination under anonymity and limited
memory.
  The goal is to minimize both the time to achieve dispersion and the memory
required per agent. It is known that any algorithm requires $\Omega(k)$ time in
the worst case, and $\Omega(\log k)$ bits of memory per agent. A recent result
[SPAA'25] gives an optimal $O(k)$-time algorithm in the synchronous setting and
an $O(k \log k)$-time algorithm in the asynchronous setting, both using
$O(\log(k+\Delta))$ bits.
  In this paper, we close the complexity gap in the asynchronous setting by
presenting the first dispersion algorithm that runs in optimal $O(k)$ time
using $O(\log(k+\Delta))$ bits of memory per agent. Our solution is based on a
novel technique we develop in this paper that constructs a port-one tree in
anonymous graphs, which may be of independent interest.

parameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these
models to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.
Deploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial
benefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized
responses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge
devices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter
selection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter
swapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings,
processing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational
resources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient
system for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA
incorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism
to streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory
management, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate
memory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient
batch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive
evaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly
outperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and
throughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times
boost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of
magnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's
potential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios,
offering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained
environments.

TL;DR: EDGChain-E是一个基于区块链和IPFS的去中心化框架，用于管理加密的能源数据版本，支持多方协作且保障数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决能源数据管理中的隐私、完整性和协作问题，同时满足FAIR原则。

Method: 结合区块链、IPFS和Git技术，使用加密Git补丁跟踪数据更新，并通过DAO实现协作治理。

Result: 框架实现了加密数据的完整性、可追溯性和隐私保护，支持多方安全协作。

Conclusion: EDGChain-E为去中心化能源应用提供了透明、可审计且不可篡改的数据管理方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new decentralized framework, named EDGChain-E
(Encrypted-Data-Git Chain for Energy), designed to manage version-controlled,
encrypted energy data using blockchain and the InterPlanetary File System. The
framework incorporates a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to
orchestrate collaborative data governance across the lifecycle of energy
research and operations, such as smart grid monitoring, demand forecasting, and
peer-to-peer energy trading. In EDGChain-E, initial commits capture the full
encrypted datasets-such as smart meter readings or grid telemetry-while
subsequent updates are tracked as encrypted Git patches, ensuring integrity,
traceability, and privacy. This versioning mechanism supports secure
collaboration across multiple stakeholders (e.g., utilities, researchers,
regulators) without compromising sensitive or regulated information. We
highlight the framework's capability to maintain FAIR-compliant (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) provenance of encrypted data. By embedding
hash-based content identifiers in Merkle trees, the system enables transparent,
auditable, and immutable tracking of data changes, thereby supporting
reproducibility and trust in decentralized energy applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对深度推荐模型（DLRM）嵌入层性能优化的方法，通过定制数据流和不对称映射策略，显著提升了嵌入查找速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLRM的嵌入层是性能瓶颈，占Meta数据中心AI工作负载的79%以上，需要优化随机内存访问。

Method: 提出了四种单核嵌入表查找策略和一个多核SoC不对称映射框架。

Result: 在华为Ascend AI加速器上实现1.5x至6.5x的速度提升，极端情况下可达20x，且对查询分布更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了嵌入层性能问题，显著提升了DLRM的推理效率。

Abstract: Deep Recommender Models (DLRMs) inference is a fundamental AI workload
accounting for more than 79% of the total AI workload in Meta's data centers.
DLRMs' performance bottleneck is found in the embedding layers, which perform
many random memory accesses to retrieve small embedding vectors from tables of
various sizes. We propose the design of tailored data flows to speedup
embedding look-ups. Namely, we propose four strategies to look up an embedding
table effectively on one core, and a framework to automatically map the tables
asymmetrically to the multiple cores of a SoC. We assess the effectiveness of
our method using the Huawei Ascend AI accelerators, comparing it with the
default Ascend compiler, and we perform high-level comparisons with Nvidia
A100. Results show a speed-up varying from 1.5x up to 6.5x for real workload
distributions, and more than 20x for extremely unbalanced distributions.
Furthermore, the method proves to be much more independent of the query
distribution than the baseline.

Abstract: The Alps Research Infrastructure leverages GH200 technology at scale,
featuring 10,752 GPUs. Accessing Alps provides a significant computational
advantage for researchers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML). While Alps serves a broad range of scientific communities, traditional
HPC services alone are not sufficient to meet the dynamic needs of the ML
community. This paper presents an initial investigation into extending HPC
service capabilities to better support ML workloads. We identify key challenges
and gaps we have observed since the early-access phase (2023) of Alps by the
Swiss AI community and propose several technological enhancements. These
include a user environment designed to facilitate the adoption of HPC for ML
workloads, balancing performance with flexibility; a utility for rapid
performance screening of ML applications during development; observability
capabilities and data products for inspecting ongoing large-scale ML workloads;
a utility to simplify the vetting of allocated nodes for compute readiness; a
service plane infrastructure to deploy various types of workloads, including
support and inference services; and a storage infrastructure tailored to the
specific needs of ML workloads. These enhancements aim to facilitate the
execution of ML workloads on HPC systems, increase system usability and
resilience, and better align with the needs of the ML community. We also
discuss our current approach to security aspects. This paper concludes by
placing these proposals in the broader context of changes in the communities
served by HPC infrastructure like ours.

Motivation: 应对平台化带来的集中化和垄断趋势，赋能本地社区通过自我组织实现社交协调。

Method: 开发了一个支持分发、克隆、生成性和多种托管选项的开源全栈架构，包括元平台、基础平台和插件系统，并通过两个案例研究验证。

Result: 通过两个案例研究（体育协会和集体学习平台）验证了该架构的可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: 通过全栈架构和配套工具链，可以在应用层实现自我组织的社交协调。

Abstract: To mitigate the restrictive centralising and monopolistic tendencies of
platformisation, we aim to empower local communities by democratising platforms
for self-organised social coordination. Our approach is to develop an
open-source, full-stack architecture for platform development that supports
ease of distribution and cloning, generativity, and a variety of hosting
options. The architecture consists of a meta-platform that is used to
instantiate a base platform with supporting libraries for generic functions,
and plugins (intended to be supplied by third parties) for customisation of
application-specification functionality for self-organised social coordination.
Associated developer- and user-oriented toolchains support the instantiation
and customisation of a platform in a two-stage process. This is demonstrated
through the proof-of-concept implementation of two case studies: a platform for
regular sporting association, and a platform for collective group study. We
conclude by arguing that self-organisation at the application layer can be
achieved by the specific supporting functionality of a full-stack architecture
with complimentary developer and user toolchains.

Motivation: 随着空中基础设施的快速发展，无人机作为空中基站（ABSs）可以扩展地面网络服务，提供按需连接并增强应急通信能力。然而，小区间干扰限制了网络效率，因此需要研究如何通过无人机旋转优化波束成形以减少干扰。

Conclusion: 无人机旋转是一种有效的干扰管理策略，能够显著提升多小区网络的性能和效率。

Abstract: With the rapid development of aerial infrastructure, unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) that function as aerial base stations (ABSs) extend terrestrial network
services into the sky, enabling on-demand connectivity and enhancing emergency
communication capabilities in cellular networks by leveraging the flexibility
and mobility of UAVs. In such a UAV-assisted network, this paper investigates
position-based beamforming between ABSs and ground users (GUs). To mitigate
inter-cell interference, we propose a novel fluid aerial network that leverages
ABS rotation to increase multi-cell capacity and overall network efficiency.
Specifically, considering the line-of-sight channel model, the spatial
beamforming weights are determined by the orientation angles of the GUs. In
this direction, we examine the beamforming gain of a two-dimensional
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array at various ground positions,
revealing that ABS rotation significantly affects multi-user channel
correlation and inter-cell interference. Based on these findings, we propose an
alternative low-complexity algorithm to design the optimal rotation angle for
ABSs, aiming to reduce inter-cell interference and thus maximize the sum rate
of multi-cell systems. In simulations, exhaustive search serves as a benchmark
to validate the optimization performance of the proposed sequential ABS
rotation scheme. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate that, in
interference-limited regions, the proposed ABS rotation paradigm can
significantly reduce inter-cell interference in terrestrial networks and
improve the multi-cell sum rate by approximately 10\% compared to
fixed-direction ABSs without rotation.

Conclusion: SS-MGSC框架通过结合生成式AI和语义通信，实现了高效的多用户内容分发和个性化服务。

Abstract: With the booming development of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a new paradigm for reliable and
efficient communication. This paper considers a multi-user downlink SemCom
system, using vehicular networks as the representative scenario for multi-user
content dissemination. To address diverse yet overlapping user demands, we
propose a multi-user Generative SemCom-enhanced intent-aware semantic-splitting
multiple access (SS-MGSC) framework. In the framework, we construct an
intent-aware shared knowledge base (SKB) that incorporates prior knowledge of
semantic information (SI) and user-specific preferences. Then, we designate the
common SI as a one-hot semantic map that is broadcast to all users, while the
private SI is delivered as personalized text for each user. On the receiver
side, a diffusion model enhanced with ControlNet is adopted to generate
high-quality personalized images. To capture both semantic relevance and
perceptual similarity, we design a novel semantic efficiency score (SES) metric
as the optimization objective. Building on this, we formulate a joint
optimization problem for multi-user semantic extraction and beamforming, solved
using a reinforcement learning-based algorithm due to its robustness in
high-dimensional settings. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed scheme.

TL;DR: mmBack是一种低功耗、无时钟的反向散射标签，支持多传感器同步数据采集和复用，通过单调制链实现高效多路复用。


<details>

Motivation: 现有反向散射标签设计仅支持单传感器，增加了空间开销，而现有复用方法依赖时钟或多调制链，增加了成本和尺寸，且易受时序漂移影响。

Method: mmBack利用共享参考信号同步传感器输入，设计电压分配方案通过单振荡器和RF开关复用传感器数据，接收端采用频率跟踪算法和有限状态机解复用。

Result: mmBack的ASIC功耗为25.56uW，支持5路5kHz或3路18kHz传感器流，信号重建平均SNR超过15dB。

Conclusion: mmBack提供了一种低成本、低功耗的多传感器同步采集方案，解决了现有设计的局限性。

Abstract: Backscatter tags provide a low-power solution for sensor applications, yet
many real-world scenarios require multiple sensors-often of different types-for
complex sensing tasks. However, existing designs support only a single sensor
per tag, increasing spatial overhead. State-of-the-art approaches to
multiplexing multiple sensor streams on a single tag rely on onboard clocks or
multiple modulation chains, which add cost, enlarge form factor, and remain
prone to timing drift-disrupting synchronization across sensors.
  We present mmBack, a low-power, clock-free backscatter tag that enables
synchronous multi-sensor data acquisition and multiplexing over a single
modulation chain. mmBack synchronizes sensor inputs in parallel using a shared
reference signal extracted from ambient RF excitation, eliminating the need for
an onboard timing source. To efficiently multiplex sensor data, mmBack designs
a voltage-division scheme to multiplex multiple sensor inputs as backscatter
frequency shifts through a single oscillator and RF switch. At the receiver,
mmBack develops a frequency tracking algorithm and a finite-state machine for
accurate demultiplexing. mmBack's ASIC design consumes 25.56uW, while its
prototype supports 5 concurrent sensor streams with bandwidths of up to 5kHz
and 3 concurrent sensor streams with bandwidth of up to 18kHz. Evaluation shows
that mmBack achieves an average SNR surpassing 15dB in signal reconstruction.

Abstract: While interest in the application of generative AI (GenAI) in network
optimization has surged in recent years, its rapid progress has often
overshadowed critical limitations intrinsic to generative models that remain
insufficiently examined in existing literature. This survey provides a
comprehensive review and critical analysis of GenAI in network optimization. We
focus on the two dominant paradigms of GenAI including generative diffusion
models (GDMs) and large pre-trained models (LPTMs), and organize our discussion
around a categorization we introduce, dividing network optimization problems
into two primary formulations: one-shot optimization and Markov decision
process (MDP). We first trace key works, including foundational contributions
from the AI community, and categorize current efforts in network optimization.
We also review frontier applications of GDMs and LPTMs in other networking
tasks, providing additional context. Furthermore, we present theoretical
generalization bounds for GDMs in both one-shot and MDP settings, offering
insights into the fundamental factors affecting model performance. Most
importantly, we reflect on the overestimated perception of GenAI's general
capabilities and caution against the all-in-one illusion it may convey. We
highlight critical limitations, including difficulties in constraint
satisfying, limited concept understanding, and the inherent probabilistic
nature of outputs. We also propose key future directions, such as bridging the
gap between generation and optimization. Although they are increasingly
integrated in implementations, they differ fundamentally in both objectives and
underlying mechanisms, necessitating a deeper understanding of their
theoretical connections. Ultimately, this survey aims to provide a structured
overview and a deeper insight into the strengths, limitations, and potential of
GenAI in network optimization.

Abstract: This paper presents advanced optimization techniques for Lua Parsing
Expression Grammars (LPeg) through two complementary case studies: a
high-performance JSON parser and a sophisticated Glob-to-LPeg pattern
converter. We demonstrate how strategic grammar construction can dramatically
improve parsing performance without modifying the underlying LPeg library. For
the JSON parser, we implement substitution capture and table construction
optimization to reduce memory allocation overhead and improve object
processing. For the Glob converter, we introduce segment-boundary separation,
implement Cox's flattened search strategy, and develop optimized braced
condition handling to prevent exponential backtracking. Comprehensive
benchmarks demonstrate that our JSON parser achieves processing speeds up to
125 MB/s on complex documents, consistently outperforming dkjson and showing
competitive results against rxi_json across most test cases. Our Glob-to-LPeg
converter exhibits 14-92% better performance than Bun.Glob and runs 3-14 times
faster than Minimatch across diverse pattern matching scenarios. This research
provides practical optimization techniques for LPeg-based parsers, contributing
valuable strategies to the text processing ecosystem.

Conclusion: 全局变量的特性可通过抽象与区域抽象的统一来解释。

Abstract: We obtain a characterization of global variables by unifying abstraction with
region abstraction in a region-based language. More precisely, in a previous
work a language called global was presented, whose virtue is to provide a
conceptually clear way of introducing imperative operations in a functional
language. Memory safety is provided by the concept of linear protection, which
connects the global system to a linear one. In this paper we show that the
concept of global variable provided by the global language arises from the
Tofte and Talping's region language through the unification of abstraction and
region abstraction.

Motivation: 随着混合、分布式和异步工作模式的普及，敏捷软件开发中的持续学习需求增加，但心理安全感在这些环境中的作用尚不明确。

Method: 采用混合方法研究，通过143名参与者的调查数据分析了敏捷社区中的心理安全感。

Result: 线上互动的心理安全感较低，且影响参与意愿；排除行为、负面互动和敌意是主要威胁。

Conclusion: 建议通过明确规范、结构化引导和积极管理提升心理安全感，为虚拟或混合工作环境提供实践指导。

Abstract: As hybrid, distributed, and asynchronous work models become more prevalent,
continuous learning in Agile Software Development (ASD) gains renewed
importance. Communities of Practice (CoPs) are increasingly adopted to support
social learning beyond formal education, often relying on virtual
communication. Psychological safety, a prerequisite for effective learning,
remains insufficiently understood in these settings. This mixed-methods study
investigates psychological safety within Agile CoPs through survey data from
143 participants. Results indicate that psychological safety is significantly
lower in online interactions compared to face-to-face settings. Moreover, low
psychological safety reduces participants' intent to continue contributing and
avoidance of interpersonal risk. No significant differences emerged based on
gender, community seniority, or content creation activity. However, differences
by role and age group suggest potential generational or role-related effects.
Thematic analysis revealed exclusionary behavior, negative interaction
patterns, and hostility as primary threats to psychological safety, often
reinforced by tribalism and specific community dynamics. Suggested
interventions include establishing explicit norms, structured facilitation, and
active moderation. The findings were validated through member checking with 30
participants. This study provides a comparative perspective on interaction
modalities and offers practical guidance for organizers seeking to cultivate
inclusive, high-impact CoPs and similarly structured virtual or hybrid work
environments.

Motivation: Python的动态类型系统在自动化重构中容易引入类型错误，影响软件可靠性和开发效率。

Result: 在1,152次重构尝试中发现了29个错误，部分问题存在于主流IDE中，部分已提交并被开发者接受。

Conclusion: 当前Python重构工具需要提高鲁棒性，以确保自动化代码转换的正确性和软件维护的可靠性。

Abstract: Python is a widely adopted programming language, valued for its simplicity
and flexibility. However, its dynamic type system poses significant challenges
for automated refactoring - an essential practice in software evolution aimed
at improving internal code structure without changing external behavior.
Understanding how type errors are introduced during refactoring is crucial, as
such errors can compromise software reliability and reduce developer
productivity. In this work, we propose a static analysis technique to detect
type errors introduced by refactoring implementations for Python. We evaluated
our technique on Rope refactoring implementations, applying them to open-source
Python projects. Our analysis uncovered 29 bugs across four refactoring types
from a total of 1,152 refactoring attempts. Several of these issues were also
found in widely used IDEs such as PyCharm and PyDev. All reported bugs were
submitted to the respective developers, and some of them were acknowledged and
accepted. These results highlight the need to improve the robustness of current
Python refactoring tools to ensure the correctness of automated code
transformations and support reliable software maintenance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码粘贴中的变量替换方法依赖启发式规则或历史模板，未能充分利用上下文信息，而研究表明超过一半的案例是上下文相关的。

Method: WIRL结合LLM、定制工具包和协调模块，采用混合策略（确定性规则和状态机引导决策）进行变量替换。

Result: 在真实数据集上，WIRL的精确匹配精度为91.7%，召回率为90.0%，显著优于先进LLM和IntelliJ IDEA。

Conclusion: WIRL为现代IDE提供了更智能、上下文感知的开发者辅助工具，尤其在复杂变量依赖场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Copy-paste-modify is a widespread and pragmatic practice in software
development, where developers adapt reused code snippets, sourced from
platforms such as Stack Overflow, GitHub, or LLM outputs, into their local
codebase. A critical yet underexplored aspect of this adaptation is code
wiring, which involves substituting unresolved variables in the pasted code
with suitable ones from the surrounding context. Existing solutions either rely
on heuristic rules or historical templates, often failing to effectively
utilize contextual information, despite studies showing that over half of
adaptation cases are context-dependent. In this paper, we introduce WIRL, an
LLM-based agent for code wiring framed as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) infilling task. WIRL combines an LLM, a customized toolkit, and an
orchestration module to identify unresolved variables, retrieve context, and
perform context-aware substitutions. To balance efficiency and autonomy, the
agent adopts a mixed strategy: deterministic rule-based steps for common
patterns, and a state-machine-guided decision process for intelligent
exploration. We evaluate WIRL on a carefully curated, high-quality dataset
consisting of real-world code adaptation scenarios. Our approach achieves an
exact match precision of 91.7% and a recall of 90.0%, outperforming advanced
LLMs by 22.6 and 13.7 percentage points in precision and recall, respectively,
and surpassing IntelliJ IDEA by 54.3 and 49.9 percentage points. These results
underscore its practical utility, particularly in contexts with complex
variable dependencies or multiple unresolved variables. We believe WIRL paves
the way for more intelligent and context-aware developer assistance in modern
IDEs.

Motivation: 动态类型语言缺乏静态类型信息，限制了传统测试生成器的效果。论文旨在通过运行时类型信息提取来解决这一问题。

Result: 实验显示，该方法能提升高达90%的分支覆盖率，并生成与其他先进类型推断工具质量相当的类型信息。

Conclusion: 类型追踪技术有效解决了动态类型语言中测试生成的类型信息不足问题，显著提升了测试效果。

Abstract: Automated unit test generation is an established research field that has so
far focused on statically-typed programming languages. The lack of type
information in dynamically-typed programming languages, such as Python,
inhibits test generators, which heavily rely on information about parameter and
return types of functions to select suitable arguments when constructing test
cases. Since automated test generators inherently rely on frequent execution of
candidate tests, we make use of these frequent executions to address this
problem by introducing type tracing, which extracts type-related information
during execution and gradually refines the available type information. We
implement type tracing as an extension of the Pynguin test-generation framework
for Python, allowing it (i) to infer parameter types by observing how
parameters are used during runtime, (ii) to record the types of values that
function calls return, and (iii) to use this type information to increase code
coverage. The approach leads to up to 90.0% more branch coverage, improved
mutation scores, and to type information of similar quality to that produced by
other state-of-the-art type-inference tools.

### [165] [DaiFu: In-Situ Crash Recovery for Deep Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01628)
*Zilong He,Pengfei Chen,Hongyu Zhang,Xiaoyun Li,Guangba Yu,Hongyang Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DaiFu是一个轻量级的深度学习系统崩溃恢复框架，通过代码转换实现原位恢复，显著减少恢复时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习系统崩溃频繁且浪费资源，现有恢复方案（如检查点重试）效率低下。

Method: DaiFu通过轻量级代码转换，拦截崩溃并动态更新运行上下文（如代码、配置等）。

Result: DaiFu将恢复时间缩短1372倍，开销低于0.40%，并在7种崩溃场景中验证有效性。

Conclusion: DaiFu为深度学习系统提供高效、低开销的崩溃恢复解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) systems have been widely adopted in many areas, and are
becoming even more popular with the emergence of large language models.
However, due to the complex software stacks involved in their development and
execution, crashes are unavoidable and common. Crashes severely waste computing
resources and hinder development productivity, so efficient crash recovery is
crucial. Existing solutions, such as checkpoint-retry, are too heavyweight for
fast recovery from crashes caused by minor programming errors or transient
runtime errors. Therefore, we present DaiFu, an in-situ recovery framework for
DL systems. Through a lightweight code transformation to a given DL system,
DaiFu augments it to intercept crashes in situ and enables dynamic and instant
updates to its program running context (e.g., code, configurations, and other
data) for agile crash recovery. Our evaluation shows that DaiFu helps reduce
the restore time for crash recovery, achieving a 1372x speedup compared with
state-of-the-art solutions. Meanwhile, the overhead of DaiFu is negligible
(under 0.40%). We also construct a benchmark spanning 7 distinct crash
scenarios in DL systems, and show the effectiveness of DaiFu in diverse
situations.

*Haichuan Hu,Congqing He,Hao Zhang,Xiaochen Xie,Quanjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: APRMCTS利用蒙特卡洛树搜索改进基于LLM的自动程序修复，解决了局部探索和冗余搜索问题，显著提升了修复效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的APR技术采用试错策略，存在局部优化和搜索效率低的问题。

Method: APRMCTS通过蒙特卡洛树搜索进行全局评估，选择最有潜力的补丁进行迭代优化。

Result: 在Defects4J的835个错误上，APRMCTS修复了201个错误，优于现有技术，且成本更低。

Conclusion: APRMCTS在复杂错误修复中表现出高效和低成本优势。

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human
intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and
maintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a
rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable
performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt
trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1)
inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low
search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose
APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS
incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing
a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising
one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the
problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of
patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that,
when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which
outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini,
GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs,
respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance
advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the
500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared
to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and
monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study
demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with
particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文介绍了软件包rdhte，用于在锐回归不连续（RD）设计中估计和推断异质性处理效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解基于预处理协变量的异质性处理效应是实证工作的关键。

Method: rdhte软件包包含三个主要命令：rdhte进行估计和稳健偏差校正推断，rdbwhte实现自动带宽选择方法，rdhte lincom计算线性组合的点估计和置信区间。

Result: 文章提供了异质性效应的概述、方法论细节，并通过实证应用进行了说明。

Conclusion: rdhte软件包在某些情况下补充并恢复了经典的RD软件包rdrobust。

Abstract: Understanding causal heterogeneous treatment effects based on pretreatment
covariates is a crucial aspect of empirical work. Building on Calonico,
Cattaneo, Farrell, Palomba, and Titiunik (2025), this article discusses the
software package rdhte for estimation and inference of heterogeneous treatment
effects in sharp regression discontinuity (RD) designs. The package includes
three main commands: rdhte conducts estimation and robust bias-corrected
inference for heterogeneous RD treatment effects, for a given choice of the
bandwidth parameter; rdbwhte implements automatic bandwidth selection methods;
and rdhte lincom computes point estimates and robust bias-corrected confidence
intervals for linear combinations, a post-estimation command specifically
tailored to rdhte. We also provide an overview of heterogeneous effects for
sharp RD designs, give basic details on the methodology, and illustrate using
an empirical application. Finally, we discuss how the package rdhte
complements, and in specific cases recovers, the canonical RD package rdrobust
(Calonico, Cattaneo, Farrell, and Titiunik 2017).

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Anderson-Rubin（AR）统计量在非线性矩限制下的应用，证明了其在不同数据分布和参数识别情况下的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AR统计量在非线性矩限制下的普适性，尤其是在参数未识别、部分识别或弱识别时的有效性。

Method: 基于连续更新估计器（CUE）的准则函数，采用非参数数据分布和参数矩限制，结合扰动和正则化方法。

Result: AR统计量的子集检验和置信区间在多种分布下均有效，包括异方差情况，且适用于横截面和时间序列数据。

Conclusion: AR统计量在广泛条件下具有一致有效性，适用于复杂数据结构和参数识别问题。

Abstract: We consider the Anderson-Rubin (AR) statistic for a general set of nonlinear
moment restrictions. The statistic is based on the criterion function of the
continuous updating estimator (CUE) for a subset of parameters not constrained
under the Null. We treat the data distribution nonparametrically with
parametric moment restrictions imposed under the Null. We show that subset
tests and confidence intervals based on the AR statistic are uniformly valid
over a wide range of distributions that include moment restrictions with
general forms of heteroskedasticity. We show that the AR based tests have
correct asymptotic size when parameters are unidentified, partially identified,
weakly or strongly identified. We obtain these results by constructing an upper
bound that is using a novel perturbation and regularization approach applied to
the first order conditions of the CUE. Our theory applies to both
cross-sections and time series data and does not assume stationarity in time
series settings or homogeneity in cross-sectional settings.

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级模型，通过定制化岭回归在异质性和同质性模型间切换，显著降低子治疗效应的MSE，并支持聚合治疗效应的重构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在观察性因果模型中，估计多个相关且部分重叠的治疗效应时，传统方法噪声过大，难以支持实际决策。

Method: 使用定制化岭回归，在异质性和同质性模型间灵活切换。

Result: 显著降低子治疗效应的MSE，并成功应用于Wayfair的定向决策。

Conclusion: 该模型在理论和模拟中验证了其有效性，为实际决策提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: When using observational causal models, practitioners often want to
disentangle the effects of many related, partially-overlapping treatments.
Examples include estimating treatment effects of different marketing
touchpoints, ordering different types of products, or signing up for different
services. Common approaches that estimate separate treatment coefficients are
too noisy for practical decision-making. We propose a computationally light
model that uses a customized ridge regression to move between a heterogeneous
and a homogenous model: it substantially reduces MSE for the effects of each
individual sub-treatment while allowing us to easily reconstruct the effects of
an aggregated treatment. We demonstrate the properties of this estimator in
theory and simulation, and illustrate how it has unlocked targeted
decision-making at Wayfair.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理复杂治疗（如培训计划的不同模块）时可能因治疗倾向的系统性差异而产生误导性结论，因此需要一种新方法来分解效应异质性和治疗异质性。

Method: 开发了一种新的分解框架，并提出半参数去偏机器学习估计器，以应对复杂治疗和有限重叠的情况。

Result: 重新分析了一项劳动力市场政策中的性别差异，发现性别差异主要由女性接受不同的治疗（如职业培训）而非相同治疗下的异质性回报驱动。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了治疗异质性在组间差异中的重要性，为政策评估提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Analysis of effect heterogeneity at the group level is standard practice in
empirical treatment evaluation research. However, treatments analyzed are often
aggregates of multiple underlying treatments which are themselves
heterogeneous, e.g. different modules of a training program or varying
exposures. In these settings, conventional approaches such as comparing
(adjusted) differences-in-means across groups can produce misleading
conclusions when underlying treatment propensities differ systematically
between groups. This paper develops a novel decomposition framework that
disentangles contributions of effect heterogeneity and qualitatively distinct
components of treatment heterogeneity to observed group-level differences. We
propose semiparametric debiased machine learning estimators that are robust to
complex treatments and limited overlap. We revisit a widely documented gender
gap in training returns of an active labor market policy. The decomposition
reveals that it is almost entirely driven by women being treated differently
than men and not by heterogeneous returns from identical treatments. In
particular, women are disproportionately targeted towards vocational training
tracks with lower unconditional returns.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的协方差矩阵估计方法（ERSE），通过调整弱因子相关的特征向量，在旋转等变框架下改善了协方差矩阵的条件数，并在实证中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场中资产回报的正相关性现象导致协方差矩阵估计困难，尤其是因子排序组合中显著的正相关性。

Method: 提出了Eigenvector Rotation Shrinkage Estimator (ERSE)，通过成对旋转特征向量并保持正交性，等效于对两个不同特征值进行多重线性收缩。

Result: ERSE在Ken French数据集的因子排序组合中表现优于现有方法，样本外组合方差平均降低10.52%（线性收缩）和12.46%（非线性收缩），且协方差矩阵条件数更低。

Conclusion: ERSE在多种情境下均表现稳定，提供了更集中的投资组合权重和一致的改进效果。

Abstract: The comovement phenomenon in financial markets creates decision scenarios
with positively correlated asset returns. This paper addresses covariance
matrix estimation under such conditions, motivated by observations of
significant positive correlations in factor-sorted portfolio monthly returns.
We demonstrate that fine-tuning eigenvectors linked to weak factors within
rotation-equivariant frameworks produces well-conditioned covariance matrix
estimates. Our Eigenvector Rotation Shrinkage Estimator (ERSE) pairwise rotates
eigenvectors while preserving orthogonality, equivalent to performing multiple
linear shrinkage on two distinct eigenvalues. Empirical results on
factor-sorted portfolios from the Ken French data library demonstrate that ERSE
outperforms existing rotation-equivariant estimators in reducing out-of-sample
portfolio variance, achieving average risk reductions of 10.52\% versus linear
shrinkage methods and 12.46\% versus nonlinear shrinkage methods. Further
checks indicate that ERSE yields covariance matrices with lower condition
numbers, produces more concentrated and stable portfolio weights, and provides
consistent improvements across different subperiods and estimation windows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献对碳排放社会成本的假设与气候变化影响、贴现和风险规避的研究存在偏差，需要修正。

Method: 使用已发表模型结果的数据库，提出元模拟器方法。

Conclusion: 元模拟器有效修正了文献中的假设偏差，揭示了更高的碳排放社会成本。

Abstract: A large database of published model results is used to estimate the
distribution of the social cost of carbon as a function of the underlying
assumptions. The literature on the social cost of carbon deviates in its
assumptions from the literatures on the impacts of climate change, discounting,
and risk aversion. The proposed meta-emulator corrects this. The social cost of
carbon is higher than reported in the literature.

Motivation: 探讨数字优惠券作为消费刺激工具的效果及其影响因素，以优化政策设计。

Method: 分析中国大规模数字优惠券项目的数据，评估补贴对消费的影响及其异质性。

Result: 每1元政府补贴带动3.4元消费；消费反应差异大；行为动机显著；高响应消费者偏向大企业；针对性分发可加倍刺激效果。

Conclusion: 结合针对性分发与对小企业的直接支持，可提升刺激计划的效率和公平性。

Abstract: We study consumption stimulus with digital coupons, which provide
time-limited subsidies contingent on minimum spending. We analyze a large-scale
program in China and present five main findings: (1) the program generates
large short-term effects, with each $\yen$1 of government subsidy inducing
$\yen$3.4 in consumer spending; (2) consumption responses vary substantially,
driven by both demand-side factors (e.g., wealth) and supply-side factors
(e.g., local consumption amenities); (3) The largest spending increases occur
among consumers whose baseline spending already exceeds coupon thresholds and
for whom coupon subsidies should be equivalent to cash, suggesting behavioral
motivations; (4) high-response consumers disproportionately direct their
spending toward large businesses, leading to a regressive allocation of
stimulus benefits; and (5) targeting the most responsive consumers can double
total stimulus effects. A hybrid design combining targeted distribution with
direct support to small businesses improves both the efficiency and equity of
the program.

TL;DR: 该研究利用德国行政数据，首次评估了集体谈判合规法律对工资的影响，发现这些法律在东德地区显著提高了工资。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨集体谈判合规法律（要求接受公共合同的机构支付集体协议工资）对工资的实际影响，尤其是在集体谈判覆盖率下降的背景下。

Method: 利用德国各联邦州法律实施时间差异，聚焦公共运输部门，采用事件研究设计估计动态处理效应。

Result: 法律实施五年内，东德地区工资平均增长2.9%至4.6%，而西德地区无显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，集体谈判合规法律在特定地区能有效保障集体协议工资，为政策制定提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Using administrative data from Germany, this study provides first evidence on
the wage effects of collective bargaining compliance laws. These laws require
establishments receiving public contracts to pay wages set by a representative
collective agreement, even if they are not formally bound by one. Leveraging
variation in the timing of law implementation across federal states, and
focusing on the public transport sector -- where regulation is uniform and
demand is driven solely by state-level needs -- I estimate dynamic treatment
effects using event-study designs. The results indicate that within five years
of the law's implementation, wage increases were on average 2.9\% to 4.6\%
higher in federal states with such a law compared to those without one -- but
only in East Germany. These findings highlight the potential for securing
collectively agreed wages in times of declining collective bargaining coverage.

Conclusion: AI的发展关乎人类自主权和制度演化的未来，奥地利学派提供了对抗计算社会控制的唯一连贯替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a praxeological analysis of artificial intelligence and
algorithmic governance, challenging assumptions about the capacity of machine
systems to sustain economic and epistemic order. Drawing on Misesian a priori
reasoning and Austrian theories of entrepreneurship, we argue that AI systems
are incapable of performing the core functions of economic coordination:
interpreting ends, discovering means, and communicating subjective value
through prices. Where neoclassical and behavioural models treat decisions as
optimisation under constraint, we frame them as purposive actions under
uncertainty.
  We critique dominant ethical AI frameworks such as Fairness, Accountability,
and Transparency (FAT) as extensions of constructivist rationalism, which
conflict with a liberal order grounded in voluntary action and property rights.
Attempts to encode moral reasoning in algorithms reflect a misunderstanding of
ethics and economics. However complex, AI systems cannot originate norms,
interpret institutions, or bear responsibility. They remain opaque, misaligned,
and inert.
  Using the concept of epistemic scarcity, we explore how information abundance
degrades truth discernment, enabling both entrepreneurial insight and soft
totalitarianism. Our analysis ends with a civilisational claim: the debate over
AI concerns the future of human autonomy, institutional evolution, and reasoned
choice. The Austrian tradition, focused on action, subjectivity, and
spontaneous order, offers the only coherent alternative to rising computational
social control.

Result: 在12期OLG模型中，发现简单的线性碳税方案能实现0.42%的福利增益，进一步复杂化仅边际提升至0.45%。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂随机环境下的宏观政策设计提供了可扩展工具，并适用于其他异质代理人问题。

Abstract: We develop a computational framework for deriving Pareto-improving and
constrained optimal carbon tax rules in a stochastic overlapping generations
(OLG) model with climate change. By integrating Deep Equilibrium Networks for
fast policy evaluation and Gaussian process surrogate modeling with Bayesian
active learning, the framework systematically locates optimal carbon tax
schedules for heterogeneous agents exposed to climate risk. We apply our method
to a 12-period OLG model in which exogenous shocks affect the carbon intensity
of energy production, as well as the damage function. Constrained optimal
carbon taxes consist of tax rates that are simple functions of observables and
revenue-sharing rules that guarantee that the introduction of the taxes is
Pareto improving. This reveals that a straightforward policy is highly
effective: a Pareto-improving linear tax on cumulative emissions alone yields a
0.42% aggregate welfare gain in consumption-equivalent terms while adding
further complexity to the tax provides only a marginal increase to 0.45%. The
application demonstrates that the proposed approach produces scalable tools for
macro-policy design in complex stochastic settings. Beyond climate economics,
the framework offers a template for systematically analyzing welfare-improving
policies in various heterogeneous-agent problems.

Abstract: Within the domain of game theory, power indexes are defined as functions that
quantify the influence of individual participants in collective decision-making
processes. Felsenthal [D. Felsenthal. A Well-Behaved Index of a Priori P-Power
for Simple N-Person Games. Homo Oeconomicus, 33, 2016] proposed a power index
with a focus on least size winning coalitions, i.e., those coalitions capable
of determining the final outcome and with the smallest number of players among
all winning coalitions. However, the Felsenthal index overlooks pre-existing
affinities between the players, a common and impactful factor in real-world
political and economic contexts. This paper introduces the Felsenthal Owen
power index, a novel index based on Felsenthal's approach that integrates
player affinities using Owen's a priori unions framework. The new index is
rigorously characterised by two distinct sets of axiomatic properties. We
demonstrate its practical utility by applying it to the International Monetary
Fund's voting system, revealing how strategic alliances significantly reshape
power distributions. The index thus offers policymakers a more sophisticated
tool for measuring influence in complex decision-making scenarios.

For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with\nobjective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other\nlanguage features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,\nconcreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to\nwhich we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.\nThose features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,\nconducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands\nof words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human\nratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover\nmany different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we\nevaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on\ntwo psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets\ncover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that\nalignment is \\textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated\n(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and\ngender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,\nolfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual).

Modern accelerators are commonly\nequipped with Tensor cores and CUDA cores to accelerate sparse operators. The\nformer brings superior computing power but only for structured matrix\nmultiplication, while the latter has relatively lower performance but with\nhigher programming flexibility. In this work, we discover that utilizing one\nresource alone leads to inferior performance for sparse matrix multiplication,\ndue to their respective limitations. To this end, we propose Libra, a\nsystematic approach that enables synergistic computation between CUDA and\nTensor cores to achieve the best performance for sparse matrix multiplication.\nSpecifically, we propose a 2D-aware workload distribution strategy to find out\nthe sweet point of task mapping for different sparse operators, leveraging both\nthe high performance of Tensor cores and the low computational redundancy on\nCUDA cores.

In recent years, both database vendors and\ncustomers have increasingly turned to autonomous database platforms in an\neffort to alleviate the heavy workload of DBAs. However, existing autonomous\ndatabase platforms are limited in their capabilities, primarily addressing\nsingle-point issues such as NL2SQL, anomaly detection, and SQL tuning. Manual\nintervention remains a necessity for comprehensive database maintenance.\nGaussMaster aims to revolutionize this landscape by introducing an LLM-based\ndatabase copilot system. This innovative solution is designed not only to\nassist developers in writing efficient SQL queries but also to provide\ncomprehensive care for database services. When database instances exhibit\nabnormal behavior, GaussMaster is capable of orchestrating the entire\nmaintenance process automatically. It achieves this by analyzing hundreds of\nmetrics and logs, employing a Tree-of-thought approach to identify root causes,\nand invoking appropriate tools to resolve issues. We have successfully\nimplemented GaussMaster in real-world scenarios, such as the banking industry,\nwhere it has achieved zero human intervention for over 34 database maintenance\nscenarios.

However,\ntraditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on\nGaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them\nunsuitable for thin crack localization.

This study presents a\nphysics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to\nSHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to\nconstruct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based\nhomography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction\nwithout the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The\nmethod is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via\nhandheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow\ninterference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared\nto classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine\nlength errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while\nmaintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,\ninterpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable\ndeployment via UAVs and mobile platforms.

Finally, we\napply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal\nadversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance.\nExperiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both\nanonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%). Our lightweight\ndesign supports direct deployment on edge devices, avoiding cloud reliance and\ncommunication-based privacy risks.

A common limitation in\nexisting vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are\ntypically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world\nscenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack\nof ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively\nevaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related\nto counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest\ndetection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting\nresult-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality\nassessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity\nassessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image\nacquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.\nNotably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis\nmethod to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity\nassessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for\npest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information\nrelated to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into\na regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting\nconfidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to\ncomprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and\nquantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting\nconfidence through a model.

Our framework, Ludax, combines the generality of\ngame description languages with the speed of modern parallel processing\nhardware and is designed to fit neatly into existing deep learning pipelines.\nWe envision Ludax as a tool to help accelerate games research generally, from\nRL to cognitive science, by enabling rapid simulation and providing a flexible\nrepresentation scheme. We present a detailed breakdown of Ludax's description\nlanguage and technical notes on the compilation process, along with speed\nbenchmarking and a demonstration of training RL agents.

Their success largely stems from the ability to\nintegrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target\ndomains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is\nubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and\nrecommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm\nto the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However,\nunlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of\ngraphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional\ncontrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario,\nwhich regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From\nexperimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific\ndifferences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from\ndifferent domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we\npropose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework,\nnamely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning\nstrategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and\nintroduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information.

Through extensive\nexperiments across four prominent LLM families (LLaMA, DeepSeek, CodeGen, and\nStarCoder) with parameter scales ranging from 350M to 33B, we evaluate\nrobustness from dual perspectives: adversarial attacks on input prompts and\nnoise perturbations on model architecture. Our findings challenge conventional\nwisdom by demonstrating that quantized LLMs often exhibit superior robustness\ncompared to their full-precision counterparts, with 51.59% versus 42.86% of our\nadversarial experiments showing better resilience in quantized LLMs. Similarly,\nour noise perturbation experiments also confirm that LLMs after quantitation\ngenerally withstand higher levels of weight disturbances. These results suggest\nthat quantization not only reduces computational requirements but can actually\nenhance LLMs' reliability in code generation tasks, providing valuable insights\nfor developing more robust and efficient LLM deployment strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u538b\u7f29\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9LLM\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u91cf\u5316LLM\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u566a\u58f0\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cdLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08LLaMA\u3001DeepSeek\u3001CodeGen\u3001StarCoder\uff09\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5316LLM\u572851.59%\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u627f\u53d7\u66f4\u9ad8\u6743\u91cd\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM\nfeedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the\nsupervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module\nto refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains.\nExperiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and\nconsistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.\nThe improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art\nperformance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs.\nNotably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token\ncost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ReG\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u91cd\u7ec4\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684RAG\u4e2d\u5f31\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u5bfc\u81f4\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u62bd\u8c61\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u65e0\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "ReG\u5229\u7528LLM\u53cd\u9988\u6d88\u9664\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u7ec4\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u94fe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aReG\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe10%\uff0c\u4ec5\u97005%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e30%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53474%\u3002", "conclusion": "ReG\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684RAG\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

Instead of relying on a pre-trained model fixed for all future\ninference queries across diverse edge devices, we argue that planning an\ninference pattern with a request-specific model tailored to the device's\ncomputational capacity, accuracy requirements, and time constraints is more\ncost-efficient and robust to diverse scenarios. To this end, we propose an\naccuracy-aware and workload-balanced inference system that integrates joint\nmodel quantization and inference partitioning. In this approach, the server\ndynamically responds to inference queries by sending a quantized model and\nadaptively sharing the inference workload with the device. Meanwhile, the\ndevice's computational power, channel capacity, and accuracy requirements are\nconsidered when deciding.\n  Furthermore, we introduce a new optimization framework for the inference\nsystem, incorporating joint model quantization and partitioning.

However,\nexisting integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems predominantly rely\non single-modal sensors as primary participants, which leads to a limited\nrepresentation of environmental features and significant performance\nbottlenecks under the emerging requirements of 6G applications. This limitation\nmotivates a paradigm shift from single-modal to multimodal ISAC. In this\narticle, we first analyze the key challenges in realizing multimodal ISAC,\nincluding the fusion of heterogeneous multimodal data, the high communication\noverhead among distributed sensors, and the design of efficient and scalable\nsystem architectures. We then introduce several enabling technologies, such as\nlarge AI models, semantic communication, and multi-agent systems, that hold\npromise for addressing these challenges.

Building on this foundation, we develop an open-source Genetic\nAlgorithm (GA) and a hybrid GA-Simulated Annealing (GASA) approach to\nefficiently configure Multi-CQF networks and introduce TI in Multi-CQF to\nenhance schedulability. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms\nsignificantly increase the number of scheduled TT flows compared to the\nbaseline Simulated Annealing (SA) model, improving scheduling by an average of\n15%.

In this work, we propose\na method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation\nusing weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an\nobject of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more\nquickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the\nsegmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create\nrealistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a\ncontrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose\nto first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create\ncounterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source\nbackgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the\ntraining loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the\nreal object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a\nsupervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could\nprovide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments\non side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds\ncompared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested\non natural images.

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We\nfirst identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an\nunnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs\nwith very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,\nto mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in\nmemory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain\nonly a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the\nvocabulary of the target model.

Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction\n(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth\nexploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution\ntransformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA\ncapability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks.

Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic,\nand technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying\nprocesses involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both\ninform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The\nworkshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language\nmodels (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of\nLLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language\nunderstanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to\noffer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between\nLLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with\nhuman feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI\ncollaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report\naims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in\ncognitive psychology, linguistics, and education.

Building on insights from\ninterpretability, we demonstrate the existence of an implicit\ntask-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first\nsolves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and\nsubsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We\nhypothesize that the failure of the translation stage is an important culprit\nfor the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the\ntranslation barrier hypothesis. We test this hypothesis for a word translation\ntask across 108 language pairs, using logit lens to observe model processing in\nintermediate layers.

These escalating trends underscore the urgent\nneed for effective approaches that can automatically detect and understand\nsoftware vulnerabilities. Objective: However, the scarcity of labeled samples\nand the class imbalance issue in vulnerability datasets present significant\nchallenges for both Vulnerability Type Prediction (VTP) and Line-level\nVulnerability Detection (LVD), especially for rare yet critical vulnerability\ntypes. Moreover, most existing studies treat VTP and LVD as independent tasks,\noverlooking their inherent correlation, which limits the potential to leverage\nshared semantic patterns across tasks. Methods: To address these limitations,\nwe propose a unified approach that integrates Embedding-Layer Driven\nAdversarial Training (EDAT) with Multi-task Learning (MTL). Specifically, EDAT\nenhances model robustness by introducing adversarial perturbations to\nidentifier embeddings, guided by semantic importance. Meanwhile, MTL improves\noverall performance by leveraging shared representations and inter-task\ncorrelations between VTP and LVD. Results: Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both VTP\nand LVD tasks. For VTP, it yields notable improvements in accuracy, precision,\nrecall, and F1-score, particularly in identifying rare vulnerability types.\nSimilarly, for LVD, our approach enhances line-level detection accuracy while\nsignificantly reducing false positives.

To evaluate VFT, we subsequently\ntrain models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which\nincorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack\nby exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models\nexploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained\nmodel's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we\nperform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%;\nwith a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT\nachieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the\ninfluence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while\nbaselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%).

Prior works focused\non diagnosis primitives or procedures limited to a subset of the problem, such\nas only data plane or only control plane faults. This paper proposes a new\nparadigm, model-based network diagnosis, that provides a systematic way to\nderive automated procedures for identifying the root cause of network failures,\nbased on reports of end-to-end user-level symptoms. The diagnosis procedures\nare systematically derived from a model of packet forwarding and routing,\ncovering hardware, firmware, and software faults in both the data plane and\ndistributed control plane. These automated procedures replace and dramatically\naccelerate diagnosis by an experienced human operator. Model-based diagnosis is\ninspired by, leverages, and is complementary to recent work on network\nverification.

To overcome these challenges, the proposed method employs an\nN-channel ControlNet that integrates (i) object preservation with size and\nplacement agnosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimination,\n(ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent backgrounds with accurate\nshadows, lighting, and prompt adherence, and (iii) explicit user control over\nbackground layouts and lighting conditions.

However,\ntraditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge\ngraphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or\nover-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring\nedges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational\nmessage passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a\n\\textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this\nstrategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its\nincident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most\npertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is\neffectively fused with the central node's own representation using a\n\\textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused\nnode message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and\nfeatures of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures\nand propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link\nprediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant\ninformation.

Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a\npromising technology for realizing wave-domain signal processing, with mobile\nSIMs offering superior communication performance compared to their fixed\ncounterparts. In this paper, we investigate a novel unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-mounted SIMs (UAV-SIMs) assisted communication system within the\nlow-altitude economy (LAE) networks paradigm, where UAVs function as both base\nstations that cache SIM-processed data and mobile platforms that flexibly\ndeploy SIMs to enhance uplink communications from ground users. To maximize\nnetwork capacity, we formulate a UAV-SIM-based joint optimization problem\n(USBJOP) that comprehensively addresses three critical aspects: the association\nbetween UAV-SIMs and users, the three-dimensional positioning of UAV-SIMs, and\nthe phase shifts across multiple SIM layers. Due to the inherent non-convexity\nand NP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three sub-optimization\nproblems, \\textit{i.e.}, association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization\nproblem (AUUOP), UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and UAV-SIM phase\nshifts optimization problem (USPSOP), and solve them using an alternating\noptimization strategy.

Persistent challenges include verifying semantic\ncorrectness beyond test suites, repairing repository-scale defects, and\nlowering the costs of LLMs. We outline research directions that combine\nlightweight human feedback, repository-aware retrieval, code analysis, and\ncost-aware planning to advance reliable and efficient LLM-based APR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e862022\u5e74\u81f32025\u5e74\u95f463\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\uff08APR\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u4e3a\u56db\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6216\u5206\u6790\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u5728APR\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e0d\u540c\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u7c7b63\u79cdLLM-based APR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u56db\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7279\u70b9\u4e0e\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6bcf\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5982\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u4ed3\u5e93\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347LLM-based APR\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video\nobject detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.\nFirst, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,\nwe can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with\ndiverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in\nthe training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all\npossible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual\nproblems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing\nduring inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as\nfully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating\nimage-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video\nobject, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale\neffortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the\nlength of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even\ngeneralizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire\nvideo. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector\non several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with\nstrong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We\nalso compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is\ncompetitive with the current state of the art even with the computational\nbottleneck.

However, transferring\nthis success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale\nbiomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and\nfragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the\ndevelopment of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained\nfrom scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical\nfoundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.\nRather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge\nfrom nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP\nmodels, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our\ntwo-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9\nmillion biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by\nfeature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from\nteacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,\nencompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.\nThe evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear\nprobing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,\nand cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models\nwhile demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image\ndomains and task settings.

In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and\ncollective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,\nrobustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving\nLLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not\nnecessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM\nagents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

However, existing ML-based TE schemes remain impractical: they\neither fail to handle topology changes or suffer from poor scalability due to\nexcessive computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose Geminet, a lightweight and scalable ML-based TE framework that can\nhandle changing topologies. Geminet is built upon two key insights: (i) a\nmethodology that decouples neural networks from topology by learning an\niterative gradient-descent-based adjustment process, as the update rule of\ngradient descent is topology-agnostic, relying only on a few gradient-related\nquantities; (ii) shifting optimization from path-level routing weights to\nedge-level dual variables, reducing memory consumption by leveraging the fact\nthat edges are far fewer than paths. Evaluations on WAN and data center\ndatasets show that Geminet significantly improves scalability. Its neural\nnetwork size is only 0.04% to 7% of existing schemes, while handling topology\nvariations as effectively as HARP, a state-of-the-art ML-based TE approach,\nwithout performance degradation.

While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness\nwhich refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and\nconstraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify\nand adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this\npaper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and\npresent the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs.\nWe examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns,\nlinguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably\nidentify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT\nand Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case\nstudies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration\nthrough prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety\nvulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak\nsusceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of\nidentity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further\nunderstanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent\ndeployments.

Despite their promise of high data rates, mmWaves suffer from\nsevere attenuation while passing through obstacles. Unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) have been proposed to offset this limitation on account of their\nadditional degrees of freedom, which can be leveraged to provide line of sight\n(LoS) transmission paths. While some prior works have proposed analytical\nframeworks to compute the LoS probability for static ground users and a UAV,\nthe same is lacking for mobile users on the ground. In this paper, we consider\nthe popular Manhattan point line process (MPLP) to model an urban environment,\nwithin which a ground user moves with a known velocity for a small time\ninterval along the roads. We derive an expression for the expected duration of\nLoS between a static UAV in the air and a mobile ground user, and validate the\nsame through simulations. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed analysis,\nwe propose a simple user association algorithm that greedily assigns the UAVs\nto users with the highest expected LoS time, and show that it outperforms the\nexisting benchmark schemes that assign the users to the nearest UAVs with LoS\nwithout considering the user mobility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0e\u79fb\u52a8\u5730\u9762\u7528\u6237\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u89c6\u8ddd\uff08LoS\uff09\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u70b9\u7ebf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4fe1\u53f7\u8870\u51cf\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56e0\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9bLoS\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u7528\u6237\u7684LoS\u6982\u7387\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u70b9\u7ebf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u9759\u6001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0e\u79fb\u52a8\u5730\u9762\u7528\u6237\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9884\u671fLoS\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u671fLoS\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5173\u8054\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1LoS\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0e\u79fb\u52a8\u7528\u6237\u7684LoS\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

By progressively injecting\nknowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314)\nusing Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work.

We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)\nand Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three\nsignificant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these\nfindings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B\n(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head\nspecialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by\nintroducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement\nverbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the\nlogit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the\nauthors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain\ncategories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction\ntoken as part of the subject of the sentence.

Furthermore, we design a specialized\nmolecule-spectrum scorer to act as a reward model for the reasoning process,\naddressing the issue of inaccurate solution evaluation in LLMs. Experimental\nresults show that our approach significantly boosts performance, particularly\ngaining more than 20% improvement on both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o.

In this paper, we present a method to solve\nthese two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single\narticulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point\nclouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.\nInstead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the\nobject surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the\nobject undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using\nmeasurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods\nthat rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an\nalternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we\nrepresent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D\nGaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,\ntranslations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our\nrepresentation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences\nbetween the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of\neach point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned\nGaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our\nmethod outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point\ncorrespondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate\nreal-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further\ndemonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to\nexisting approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are\ncompletely occluded in some time-steps. Notably, our part segmentation\nperformance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13% on point clouds with\nocclusions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u5904\u7406\u70b9\u4e91\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u906e\u6321\u548c\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f02\u6b65\u91c7\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u906e\u6321\u6216\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f02\u6b65\u91c7\u96c6\u5bfc\u81f4\u70b9\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u5e73\u79fb\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u70b9\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd513%\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u70b9\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, deploying RL agents in\nproduction environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective\nreward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content\nor mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be\noptimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for\niteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a\nuser-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes\nupdated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary\nof performance statistics from prior training rounds.

To address this gap,\nwe introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to\nevaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse\ncastes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to\ncurate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations,\nwhere biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we\ngenerate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe\nLLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks:\nplausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on\nthese tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities,\nwith models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes.

To\ngenerate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep\nlearning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that\nlearns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial\nattribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset\nfor colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121\nlarge-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute\ncomplexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve\nthe quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU\nframework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a\ngeometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the\nlatter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood\ncorrelations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute\nup-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation\n(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate\ncoarse up-sampled attributes for each point.

To address these challenges,\nwe propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic\nmanipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the\nconstruction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration\nvideos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various\nobject manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic\nDistillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM).

Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language\nmodel (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for\nperformance enhancement.

This separate\nencoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,\nthese methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often\nrequiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.\nInspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.\nMatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the\ndetector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and\ncamera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view\nfrom the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free\nmatching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without\nrelying on multi-frame accumulation.

Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting\ntarget concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with\nminimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods\nusually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work,\nwe first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion\nmodels, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \\emph{linear} modules to\nweights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we\npropose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding\n\\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or\ncut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad\ndistributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the\nforgetting.

At its core is a hierarchical\nHopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic\ntokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or\nsupervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences\nas multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind\nco-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an\nemergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into\nlong-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter\nnatural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with\ncoherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.\nLanguage is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints\ndictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in\nalignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form\nof plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to\ngeneralize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We\ndemonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds\ndistributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These\nemergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value\nmechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture\nprovides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can\nemerge from local neural learning.

In response,\ngenerative radiance manifolds emerge as an efficient approach for constrained\npoint sampling within volumes, effectively reducing computational demands and\nenabling the learning of fine details. This work introduces SemFaceEdit, a\nnovel method that streamlines the appearance and geometric editing process by\ngenerating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds. Utilizing latent\ncodes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance\nassociated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In\ncontrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire\nradiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial\nsemantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network\ncomprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic\nradiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible\nfor predicting RGB radiance.

We\nintroduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned\nLLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we\nfind that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling\nthe fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding\nand our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the\nratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training\ncomponent. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs\ncircumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is\nconsistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those\nwhere they do not.

However, in CP, an ego agent needs\nto receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to\nattacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a\nunified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which\nis a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately\ndetect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key\nidea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego\nagent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a\nprobability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a\nsubset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior\nprobabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative\nconsistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)\nsegmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its\ncollaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In\naddition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to\ndynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the\nreliability of the systems in dynamic environments.

NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including\nself-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and\nspontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and\nmorphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This\nlimitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow\nquadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information\nwhich impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands\nof real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by\nrecent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on\na coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary\nresolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and\ntexture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with\nminimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture\nand loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and\nperformance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD\noutputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent\nproperties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,\ninference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the\napplicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,\nand 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and\nmorphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed\nframework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal\ncomputational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff08NCA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86NCA\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6e05\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "NCA\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5267\u589e\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u53d7\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9690\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6269\u5c55NCA\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u7c97\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884cNCA\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86NCA\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6e05\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u6d8c\u73b0\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86NCA\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In VPT, we uncover\n``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch\nembeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's\nself-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key\nand query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,\nrespectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for\nlearning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,\nde-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before\nlearning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch\nembeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt\nto be learned in a bilinear manner.

These findings challenge the validity\nof current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the\nneed for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing\ninference from available information, rather than as static output selection.\nWe release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and\ndiagnostic assessments of model reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff08SocialIQa\u3001FauxPas-EAI\u3001ToMi\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cdLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u5206\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u8f93\u51fa\u5f62\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9ad8\u5206\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u5bf9\u683c\u5f0f\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cdLLM\uff08GPT-3\u3001GPT-3.5\u3001GPT-4\u3001GPT-o1\u548cLLaMA 3.1\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u9879\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u63aa\u8f9e\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u7b54\u6848\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9ad8\u5206\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u683c\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Recent progress in hate speech detection is\ntypically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource\nlanguages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,\nhigh-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this\nlimitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on\nlow-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -\nzero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot\nprompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to\ndetect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the\nmetaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that\nmarks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods.

Existing training paradigms,\nincluding Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding\nthe capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to\nSVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,\nultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance.

One hope is that they can support\nmathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle\ntextual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word\nproblems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the\nreal-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We\nconducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including\nthree parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in\nresearch, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical\nword problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the\nconceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs\nand students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled\nmathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics\neducation. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most\npopular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require\na consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our\nevaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems\nshows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,\nincluding a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed\nweaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or\nnon-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have\nmastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,\nwhich potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics\nclassrooms.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6559\u80b2\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u5982\u4f55\u652f\u6301\u6570\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5e94\u7528\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6559\u80b2\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u6982\u8ff0\u3001\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5e94\u7528\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff08\u5982PISA\u9898\u76ee\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u4ec5\u638c\u63e1\u8868\u9762\u89e3\u9898\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u672a\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u5e94\u7528\u9898\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u6709\u9650\u3002"}}

Leveraging a synthetic braid model inspired by braid\ntheory, our approach effectively captures the complex intertwined structures of\nbraids. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches, providing superior accuracy, realism, and\nefficiency in reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles, supporting expressive\nhairstyle modeling in digital humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u76843D\u7f16\u7ec7\u53d1\u578b\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u56feRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7f16\u7ec7\u53d1\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u53d7\u7f16\u7ec7\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7f16\u7ec7\u53d1\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u652f\u6301\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u53d1\u578b\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

Due to the limitations\nof current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing\nmethods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and\ndistinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a\nFrequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the\naccuracy of vertebrae segmentation.

For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency\nFeature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter\nout noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the\nlow-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)\nto aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,\nextracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies\nwith linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is\nessential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation\naccuracy.

However, most existing deep learning-based multi-view classification\nmethods focus on feature fusion across different views, neglecting the\nimportance of representation learning and the difference in class features. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement\nFramework (CVC-RF) that processes information from Corpus-, View-, and\nCategory-levels, enhancing model performance. Our contribution is four-fold.\nFirst, to the best of our knowledge, we are the foremost deep learning-based\nmethod for CPG according to the latest Carotid Plaque-RADS guidelines. Second,\nwe propose a novel center-memory contrastive loss, which enhances the network's\nglobal modeling capability by comparing with representative cluster centers and\ndiverse negative samples at the Corpus level.

Specifically, unlike previous methods that use\ndepth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the\nexpectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample\npoints from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce\nconstraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object\nboundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the\ncorrect geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a\nvisualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at\nthe rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera\nparameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to\ncamera parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach in representing scenes with small camera motion\ninput, and our results compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6df1\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08DDR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u60013D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u5c0f\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u60013D\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\u6216\u9759\u6b62\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u793a\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDDR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Gumbel-softmax\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u6e32\u67d3\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DDR\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c0f\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Typically, existing methods adopt unified\nrepresentation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal\nfeatures of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm\nfails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame\nimaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.\nTo address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various\nlatent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between\nbackground and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate\nfor frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting\nframework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we\nfigure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in\nframe-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal\nfeatures, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between\nbackground and objects via clustering.

In recent years, transformer-based models in this field have made some\nprogress. However, they still face three primary challenges: 1) the\nself-attention mechanism tends to suppress high-frequency components in the\nfeatures, which severely impacts model performance; 2) the computational cost\nof transformers is relatively high. To address these issues, we propose a novel\nHigh-frequency Augmentation and Multi-Wave mixing (HAMW) method for person\nsearch. HAMW is designed to enhance the discriminative feature extraction\ncapabilities of transformers while reducing computational overhead and\nimproving efficiency. Specifically, we develop a three-stage framework that\nprogressively optimizes both detection and re-identification performance. Our\nmodel enhances the perception of high-frequency features by learning from\naugmented inputs containing additional high-frequency components.

However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge\ncommunication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication\nlatency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is\nonly available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is\nproposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)\nevents. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI\nprocess communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event\nlocating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are\nclassified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.\nSecond, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a\ncommunication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help\nusers interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a\nlocated PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is\ndesigned to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called\nthe communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show\nits communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each\nleaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL\nevent attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their\nsimulations.

The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image\nby leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both\nimages captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,\ni.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image\ninpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content\ndistinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such\nan application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image\nby referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the\nreference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to\nachieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address\nsuch an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution\nTransition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the\ntime-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of\ndamaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP\nsolution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven\nDiffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and\nconducts latent cross-reference during sampling.

However,\nlarge-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and\nweb-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This\nproblem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining\nhigh-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces\nVision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a\nvision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in\nmulti-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and\ntheir associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the\nCLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by\ncomputing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization\nis performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,\nand surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing\nimage-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.\nSecond, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,\nfollowed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels\ninto unified label groups.

Although existing deepfake detection\nmodels demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods\nonly provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In\ncritical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the\ncredibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the\ninterpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation\nmasks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of\nthese methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most\ncurrent deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few\ndatasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted\nforgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data\nscale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios.

The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\ntechniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic\nsurgical scenes in real-time.

GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware\nCity-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient\nhierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic\ninformation for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues,\ndistance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii)\nGeographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as\narea segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language\nmodels (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate\nGCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess\nperformance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive\nbenchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging\ntasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement.\nExperiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D\nlanguage fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our\nknowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic\nreasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework\nfor modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging\nthe concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS).

However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus\non single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing\nquestion: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our\nfindings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can\nprovide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are\nsubstantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like\nMobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base\n(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model\nCo-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)\nCo-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models\nthroughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)\nSelf-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised\nlearning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain.

Existing\napproaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn\nnew motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or\n''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve\ncomplex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the\nmodel to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the\nvisual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended\naction. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new\nmotion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic\nguidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the\ndual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and\nmotion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features\nwhile preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the\nvisual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a\npre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal\ncoherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy\nwhich \\textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported\nby the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This\nstrategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across\ndiverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark\nwith diverse motion patterns.

This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity\nconsistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2)\ngenerating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework\nfor identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we\npropose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and\ntextual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing\ncoherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance.\nSecond, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that\ndynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving\nfine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a\nself-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on\noptical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without\nrequiring additional inputs.

This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention\non a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying\nlearning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single\nmatrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to\nsingle-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results\nindicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each\nlabel being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This\nleads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks,\nthereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several\ndistinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy\nbut differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields\nsuperior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on\nhundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is\nachieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer\nblocks with convolutional layers.

In this work,\nwe first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using\nVII as the \"condition\" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even\nrandom noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned\ncounterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts\nconditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT\nproblem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning\n(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by\nlearning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be\nused as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT\nschemes.

This work\nimplements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by\nleveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of\nhuman-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our\napproach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for\nsimilar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based\non explanation complexity. Robustness is tested for different image\naugmentations. Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation\ncomplexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether\nexplanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as\nrotation and noise.

Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference\nannotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.\nTo address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the\nVLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and\ndriver behavior.

Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its\nextensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model\nadaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However,\nexisting approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which\noverlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in\nthe weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that\nleverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a\nmulti-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the\nwavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA\nobtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution\nanalysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while\nproviding greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.\nThrough comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA\nperforms superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,\nclassification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated\nimage quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was\nprimarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in\nlanguage tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.\nThe code is publicly available at\n\\href{GitHub}{https://github.com/moeinheidari7829/WaRA}.", "AI": {"tldr": "WaRA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5206\u6790\u6539\u8fdbLoRA\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LoRA\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u6216\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "WaRA\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u9891\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u53d8\u6362\u91cd\u5efa\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "WaRA\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "WaRA\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Current approaches extract the surface through costly\npost-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or\nrequiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of\nvertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to\na surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all\ngeometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel\nGaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and\nsurface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D\nGaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the\nmesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration\ndirectly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities\noptimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical\ncontributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both\nrepresentations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying\ngeometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each\ntraining iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay\ntriangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D\nGaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric\nerosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds,\nwith state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh\nvertices than previous methods.

Addressing the challenges of\nprecise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our\nframework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a\nself-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image\ngenerative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically\nconstruct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a\nlocalized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which\ncomprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from\nreference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to\ndirectly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing\nthe refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's\naccurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph\npositioning.

However, due to the need for per-sample network\ntraining, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical\nadoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the\ncomponents of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in\nterms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.\nWe uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a\nstate-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When\nall methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7\ndifferent UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared\nto the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then\ntackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of\nhyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle\ntraining from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the\nweights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher\nquality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at\n0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by\n0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar\nspeeds.

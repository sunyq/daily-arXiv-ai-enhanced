### [1] [Renewable Energy Sources Selection Analysis with the Maximizing Deviation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07011)
*Kirisci Murat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于偏差最大化方法的优化模型，结合区间值Fermatean模糊集来处理部分已知特征权重问题，并将其应用于可再生能源选择的多准则决策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多准则决策方法需要有效处理决策中的不确定性和模糊性，特别是在可再生能源选择这种技术性、管理性和政治性兼具的复杂决策问题中。Fermatean模糊环境能够更好地量化人类思维和感知中的不确定性。

Method: 采用Fermatean模糊环境（模糊集的推广），提出基于偏差最大化方法的优化模型来确定部分已知的特征权重，并结合区间值Fermatean模糊集进行处理。

Result: 该方法成功应用于可再生能源选择问题，能够有效处理决策过程中的不确定性和模糊性，为决策者提供更好的决策工具。

Conclusion: 结合Fermatean模糊集和偏差最大化方法的优化模型为多准则决策提供了有效的工具，特别适用于处理可再生能源选择等复杂决策问题中的不确定性和模糊判断。

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

### [2] [From Eigenmodes to Proofs: Integrating Graph Spectral Operators with Symbolic Interpretable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07017)
*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Spectral NSR是一个完全频谱的神经符号推理框架，通过图信号处理和拉普拉斯特征结构将逻辑规则嵌入为频谱模板，在频谱域直接进行推理，统一了符号推理的可解释性和频谱学习的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统神经符号推理系统在可扩展性、适应性和可解释性方面的局限性，作者希望开发一个能够结合符号推理严谨性和神经网络学习能力的统一框架。

Method: 利用图信号处理和基于知识图谱拉普拉斯特征结构的频率选择性滤波器，将逻辑规则嵌入为频谱模板。包含动态图和基学习、有理和扩散滤波器、频谱专家混合、证明引导训练、不确定性量化等扩展功能。

Result: 在ProofWriter和CLUTRR等推理基准测试中，Spectral NSR相比transformer、消息传递神经网络和神经符号逻辑编程系统，实现了更高的准确性、更快的推理速度、更好的对抗鲁棒性和更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: Spectral NSR为下一代推理系统提供了一个可扩展且原则性的基础，提供了超越传统方法的透明度、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI技术基于概率模型采样，默认缺乏正确性、安全性、公平性等保证，需要统计方法来提高其可靠性。

Method: 回顾现有相关研究工作，解释使用的通用统计技术及其在生成式AI中的具体应用。

Result: 统计方法为生成式AI提供了提高可靠性的潜在途径，同时也能改进AI评估质量和效率，以及设计干预实验。

Conclusion: 统计方法在增强生成式AI可靠性方面具有重要价值，但存在局限性，需要进一步研究和发展。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is emerging as an important technology,
promising to be transformative in many areas. At the same time, generative AI
techniques are based on sampling from probabilistic models, and by default,
they come with no guarantees about correctness, safety, fairness, or other
properties. Statistical methods offer a promising potential approach to improve
the reliability of generative AI techniques. In addition, statistical methods
are also promising for improving the quality and efficiency of AI evaluation,
as well as for designing interventions and experiments in AI.
  In this paper, we review some of the existing work on these topics,
explaining both the general statistical techniques used, as well as their
applications to generative AI. We also discuss limitations and potential future
directions.

### [4] [Instruction Agent: Enhancing Agent with Expert Demonstration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07098)
*Yinheng Li,Hailey Hultquist,Justin Wagle,Kazuhito Koishida*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Agent是一个GUI代理，通过专家演示学习复杂任务，严格遵循用户轨迹执行，使用验证器和回溯器模块处理意外情况，在OSWorld任务上达到60%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理在处理新颖UI元素、长序列动作和个性化轨迹的复杂任务时仍存在困难，需要更可靠的自动化解决方案。

Method: 基于单次专家演示提取分步指令，严格按用户意图轨迹执行，配备验证器评估动作结果，回溯器处理意外中断（如弹窗）。

Result: 在OSWorld测试集上实现60%的成功率，所有顶级代理此前都无法完成这些任务。

Conclusion: Instruction Agent提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架，弥合了当前GUI代理与可靠真实世界GUI任务自动化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

### [6] [Autoencoder-Based Denoising of Muscle Artifacts in ECG to Preserve Skin Nerve Activity (SKNA) for Cognitive Stress Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07146)
*Farnoush Baghestani,Jihye Moon,Youngsun Kong,Ki Chon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于一维卷积自编码器和LSTM的深度学习去噪方法，用于从EMG污染的高频ECG记录中重建干净的皮肤神经活动信号，显著提升信噪比和信号质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤神经活动(SKNA)是监测交感神经系统的重要非侵入性指标，但易受肌电信号(EMG)污染。传统带通滤波方法在持续肌肉活动时效果有限，需要更鲁棒的去噪技术。

Method: 使用轻量级一维卷积自编码器结合LSTM瓶颈层，在留一受试者交叉验证框架下训练模型，模拟真实噪声水平(-4dB至-8dB信噪比)的EMG污染数据。

Result: 方法将信噪比提升高达9.65dB，与干净SKNA的互相关系数从0.40提高到0.72，基于爆发的SKNA特征恢复至接近干净的判别能力(AUROC≥0.96)，在严重噪声水平下分类准确率达91-98%。

Conclusion: 深度学习重建方法能在显著EMG干扰下保留生理相关的交感神经爆发特征，为自然环境中运动丰富的SKNA监测提供更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

### [7] [PaVeRL-SQL: Text-to-SQL via Partial-Match Rewards and Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07159)
*Heng Hao,Wenjun Hu,Oxana Verkholyak,Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh,Baruch Gutow,Sima Didari,Masoud Faraki,Hankyu Moon,Seungjai Min*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaVeRL-SQL是一个结合部分匹配奖励和语言强化学习的框架，通过两种管道（语言RL和CoT RL）在Text-to-SQL任务上实现SOTA性能，在工业级基准测试中显著提升执行准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法在工业级数据库和涉及领域特定业务逻辑的复杂问题上执行准确率较低，需要开发更可靠的解决方案来应对实际工业约束。

Method: 采用两种管道：1) 基于大语言模型的语言强化学习框架，包含组自评估；2) 基于小模型(OmniSQL-7B)的思维链强化学习管道，使用特殊设计的奖励函数和两阶段RL训练。

Result: 在Spider、Spider 2.0和BIRD基准测试上达到SOTA结果，其中在Spider2.0-SQLite基准上，语言RL管道比SOTA高7.4%，CoT管道高1.4%。混合SQL方言训练带来三倍性能提升。

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL在现实工业约束下提供了可靠、SOTA级别的Text-to-SQL解决方案，特别在处理有限训练数据的SQL方言方面表现优异。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at
https://github.com/PaVeRL-SQL/PaVeRL-SQL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 每年数百万人通过法律援助热线寻求帮助，错误分类会导致严重后果（错过截止日期、遭受虐待、失去住房或子女监护权），需要准确识别法律问题以确保用户获得正确的法律帮助。

Method: 使用混合LLM/ML集成分类方法，自动生成后续问题来丰富初始问题叙述，基于419个真实世界非营利律师转介服务查询数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 分类准确率（hits@2）达到97.37%，使用低成本模型组合超越了当前最先进的GPT-5模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著降低法律系统用户引导成本的同时实现了高准确性，有望改善法律求助服务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出基于CNN-LSTM混合深度学习的入侵检测系统，用于智能电网安全防护，达到99.70%的检测准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电网集成可再生能源和现代通信技术，但SCADA协议存在安全漏洞，容易受到非授权访问和拒绝服务攻击

Method: 采用CNN进行特征提取，LSTM进行时间模式识别，构建混合深度学习模型，使用DNP3和IEC104入侵检测数据集进衈训练和测试

Result: 与其他深度学习方法相比，在准确率、精确率、回归率和F1分数方面显著提升，检测准确率达到99.70%

Conclusion: 证明了CNN-LSTM混合模型在智能电网安全防护中的高效性，为实时数据收集和控制提供了可靠的网络安全保障

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

Conclusion: BlendedNet为非常规构型提供了宝贵的数据资源，并展示了端到端代理建模框架在空气动力学预测中的有效性

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

Conclusion: 小型语言模型虽然不完美，但是一种有前景的新一代隐私保护健康监测解决方案

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

*Vardhan Palod,Karthik Valmeekam,Kaya Stechly,Subbarao Kambhampati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文对中间令牌生成(ITG)机制进行了批判性分析，发现中间追踪长度与问题难度并不呈显著相关，而是主要受训练数据分布影响，挑战了将长追踪解释为"思考努力"的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对中间令牌生成机制的理解不清，广泛存在将其人格化为"思考"的假设，并认为长追踪表示更高的问题适应性计算。论文想要批判性检验这种假设是否成立。

Method: 使用A* 搜索算法的演绎追踪从头训练transformer模型，这种方法能够提供精确可验证的问题复杂性度测量。首先在简单问题上评估，然后系统性地在分布外问题上评估中间令牌长度与真实A* 追踪长度的关系。

Result: 发现即使在最简单的任务中，模型也经常产生过长的推理追踪甚至失败。中间令牌长度与真实A* 追踪长度只有松散相关。仅在问题距离训练分布较近时才出现相关性，表明这是近似回忆而非真正的问题适应性计算。

Conclusion: 问题实例的内在计算复杂性并非关键因素，关键在于其与训练数据的分布距离。这些结果挑战了中间追踪生成是适应问题难度的假设，并警告不要将R1等系统中的长序列自动解释为"思考努力"的标志。

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

Motivation: 受到AlphaEvolve启发，但AlphaEvolve仅限于数百行代码的孤立内核，需要将LLM代码进化扩展到完整代码库规模，解决NP完全问题SAT的求解器自动演化。

Method: SATLUTION框架协调LLM智能体在严格正确性保证和分布式运行时反馈下直接演化求解器代码库，同时自我演化进化策略和规则，从SAT竞赛2024代码库开始。

Result: 演化出的求解器在SAT竞赛2025中显著超越了人类设计的冠军，同时在2024基准测试上也超越了2024和2025年的冠军方案。

Conclusion: SATLUTION成功证明了LLM代码进化可以扩展到完整代码库规模，在复杂算法问题上实现超越人类专家的性能表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出Language Self-Play (LSP)方法，通过自博弈强化学习让语言模型在没有额外数据的情况下自我提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型发展面临的数据依赖瓶颈问题，避免需要不断获取更多训练数据的限制

Method: 基于博弈论的自博弈框架，将模型能力转化为竞争游戏中的表现，通过模型与自己对抗来产生更强的策略

Result: 在Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct上的实验显示，预训练模型仅通过自博弈就能在指令跟随基准上提升性能，且效果优于数据驱动的基线方法

Conclusion: 自博弈强化学习是突破数据依赖瓶颈的有效途径，使语言模型能够不依赖额外数据而持续自我改进

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SheetDesigner是一个零样本、无需训练的电子表格布局生成框架，使用多模态大语言模型结合规则和视觉反射，在离散网格结构上处理组件放置和内容填充，比基线方法提升至少22.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格在数据任务中至关重要，但手动设计布局耗时且需要专业知识。现有自动化布局模型不适合电子表格，因为它们忽略电子表格的离散网格结构和独特的语义关联。

Method: 提出SheetDesigner框架，使用多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)，结合规则反射和视觉反射进行组件放置和内容填充。该方法零样本且无需训练，专门处理电子表格的离散网格结构。

Result: 在3,326个电子表格数据集上评估，SheetDesigner比五个基线方法至少提升22.6%。通过视觉模态，MLLMs能很好地处理重叠和平衡，但在对齐方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: SheetDesigner为电子表格布局生成提供了有效的自动化解决方案，证明了混合规则和视觉反射策略的有效性，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在交通物流系统动力学建模中虽然提高了可扩展性和预测准确性，但牺牲了解释性和因果可靠性，这在关键决策系统中至关重要

Method: 提出了一个混合框架，结合概念可解释性、机制可解释性和因果机器学习技术，构建基于语义意义变量的神经网络模型

Result: 该框架旨在应用于欧盟AutoMoTIF项目的实际案例，支持多式联运物流终端的数据驱动决策、自动化和优化

Conclusion: 神经符号方法可以弥合黑盒预测模型与复杂动态环境中关键决策支持需求之间的差距，特别是在工业物联网赋能的网络物理系统中

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有白盒/灰盒方法实用性低和黑盒方法转移性差的问题，提高LLM对直接提示注入攻击的防御能力

Method: 构建基于替代模型激活值的能量模型(EBM)评估攻击提示质量，采用标记级Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC)采样进行适应性优化

Result: 在5个主流LLM上达到49.6%攻击成功率，比人工制作提示提高34.6%，在未见任务场景下保持36.6%的ASR

Conclusion: 激活值与攻击效果存在相关性，语义模式在转移性漏洞利用中发据关键作用，该框架为无梯度黑盒攻击提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

Motivation: 大语言模型在组织应用中可能产生偏离主题、歧视性或有害内容，这种AI对齐问题源于采用过程中的信息不对称和黑盒特性，现有研究未能解决组织采用者与黑盒LLM代理之间的信息不对称问题

Method: 基于代理（契约）理论构建概念框架LLM ATLAS，采用组织LLM采用阶段和代理理论作为概念进行概念性文献分析

Result: 开发了针对组织LLM采用期间AI对齐方法的扩展文献分析流程，并提供了首个LLM对齐问题-解决方案空间

Conclusion: LLM ATLAS框架为组织在采用大语言模型时解决对齐问题提供了理论基础和实践指导，填补了现有研究在组织层面AI对齐的空白

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

TL;DR: DeepGraphLog是一个新的神经符号AI框架，通过图神经网络谓词扩展ProbLog，支持多层神经符号推理，解决了现有框架在图形数据结构中的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经符号AI框架（如DeepProbLog）采用固定的神经处理后再符号推理的流程，无法处理复杂依赖关系，特别是在图形等不规则数据结构中。

Method: 扩展ProbLog引入图神经网络谓词，将符号表示视为图形，允许神经和符号组件以任意顺序分层处理，实现多层神经符号推理。

Result: 在规划、知识图谱补全和GNN表达能力等任务中，DeepGraphLog能有效捕捉复杂关系依赖，克服现有神经符号系统的关键限制。

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog通过将神经符号AI扩展到图结构领域，提供了一个更表达性和灵活的神经符号集成框架。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

TL;DR: FTR框架结合用户反馈和增强解码机制，通过负反馈触发再生和长时多路径解码来解决LLM自校正的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时容易生成错误内容，现有自校正方法存在两个关键问题：缺乏可靠的错误定位信号，以及受限于传统next-token解码的浅层推理深度

Method: 提出Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR)框架，仅在收到用户负反馈时激活响应再生，避免错误传播；引入Long-Term Multipath (LTM)解码，通过延迟序列评估实现多推理路径的系统探索

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，该框架相比最先进的基于提示的自校正方法取得了持续且显著的改进

Conclusion: FTR框架通过结合用户反馈和增强解码机制，有效解决了LLM自校正的关键限制，为提升模型推理可靠性提供了新思路

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奥林匹克级基准测试存在评分噪声和潜在偏差问题，如异构答案格式需要模型判断、依赖可能有缺陷的解决方案等，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 开发RIMO双轨基准：RIMO-N重写335个IMO问题为单一整数答案；RIMO-P包含456个证明问题，分解为子问题序列，通过自动化评分系统评估逐步推理过程。

Result: 对10个前沿LLM（包括GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Flash）的测试显示，虽然这些系统在旧基准上表现优异，但在RIMO上性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: RIMO揭示了当前LLM能力与实际奥林匹克级推理之间的巨大差距，为未来研究提供了具有挑战性且易于评估的高分辨率基准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

Result: 识别差异丰度分类单元，增强特征选择的生物学可解释性，改进对微生物组数据的时空模式捕捉能力

Conclusion: BDPM方法为基于肠道菌群的帕金森病分类提供了更有效的特征提取方案，具有更好的生物学解释性和预测性能

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

Motivation: 大型推理语言模型(LRLMs)在解决复杂任务时存在固定的推理token预算限制，需要一种能够自适应平衡效率和可靠性的方法

Method: 受GAN生成器/判别器框架启发，使用批评模型定期评估自身推理置信度，达到目标置信阈值时终止推理，否则继续推理

Result: 在AIME2024和AIME2025数据集上，CGR提高了基线准确率并减少token使用；64次多种子实验显示稳定性好，方差降低；可节省数百万token

Conclusion: 置信度是推理充分性的有力信号，CGR使大型推理语言模型更加自适应、可信且资源高效，为实际部署铺平道路

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

Motivation: 解决ChatGPT等大语言模型在教室中提供过时或虚构信息的问题，通过RAG技术基于外部资源提高回答的可靠性。

Method: 使用EduScopeQA数据集(3,176个问题)，比较矩阵基和图基两种RAG方案，评估它们在不同学科、问题类型和供应成本下的表现。

Result: OpenAI矩阵搜索RAG在低成本事实查找上表现优异；GraphRAG Global在主题性问答中提供更丰富的教育内容；GraphRAG Local在文本整合性关键时准确率最高。图基RAG资源消耗10-20倍。

Conclusion: 建议采用动态分支框架，根据查询类型路由到最优的检索方法，以同时提高信度和效率，为教育者提供可操作的RAG集成指南。

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: CP-Model-Zoo是一个基于专家编写模型的检索系统，通过用户自然语言描述从数据库中检索最接近的源代码模型，帮助非专家用户使用约束编程解决组合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束编程建模语言复杂、全局约束众多、建模技巧要求高，阻碍了非专家用户使用CP解决组合问题。需要一种方法让非专家能够轻松获得专家级模型。

Method: 利用多年积累的专家编写模型构建数据库，通过用户自然语言描述检索最接近的源代码模型，无需人工数据标注。

Result: 实验显示系统在不同专业水平的用户问题描述下，检索正确模型的准确率很高。

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo通过检索专家验证的模型，有效降低了非专家用户使用约束编程的门槛，为问题求解提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

TL;DR: HiPhO是首个专注于高中物理奥林匹克竞赛的基准测试，提供人类对齐评估，包含13个最新奥赛试题、专业评分标准和与人类选手的直接对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理基准测试存在两大缺陷：缺乏对物理奥林匹克竞赛等真实世界物理竞赛的系统性覆盖，以及无法实现与人类选手的直接性能对比。

Method: 收集2024-2025年13个国际和地区奥赛试题，采用官方评分标准进行细粒度评分，并根据官方奖牌阈值给模型分配金、银、铜牌。

Result: 开源MLLM大多处于铜牌水平；开源LLM偶尔能获金牌；闭源推理MLLM可获得6-12枚金牌；所有模型与满分仍有显著差距。

Conclusion: 开源模型与顶尖学生存在显著性能差距，闭源推理模型展现出强大的物理推理能力，仍有很大改进空间。HiPhO作为严谨的人类对齐基准测试已开源。

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

*Valen Tagliabue,Leonard Dung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文开发了测量语言模型福利的实验方法，通过比较言词报告咊行为表达的偏好，发现了这些测量方法之间的相互支持性，但在不同模型咊条件下结果存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发实验性方法来测量语言模型的福利状态，通过比较不同测量方式的一致性来评估偏好满足是否可以作为福利的代理指标。

Method: 使用多种实验范式：比较模型的言词偏好报告与虚拟环境中的行为选择，测试成本和奖励对行为的影响，以及测试语义等价提示下完善福利量表的一致性。

Result: 观察到了说明的偏好与行为之间的可靠相关性，表明偏好满足在某些AI系统中可以作为经验性的福利代理。但不同模型咊条件下的一致性存在差异，并且对提示的微小变动效果不一致。

Conclusion: 虽然目前不确定这些方法是否真正测量了语言模型的福利状态，但研究结果显示了在语言模型中进行福利测量的可行性，开启了进一步探索的可能性。

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型评估指标（如连贯性和多样性）只能捕捉狭窄的统计模式，无法解释实际中的语义失败，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 开发了面向目标的评估框架，使用9个基于LLM的指标，涵盖词汇有效性、主题内语义合理性、主题间结构合理性和文档-主题对齐合理性四个维度，并通过对抗性和抽样协议进行验证。

Result: LLM-based指标提供了可解释、稳健且任务相关的评估，能够发现传统指标经常遗漏的关键弱点，如冗余和语义漂移。

Conclusion: 该框架支持开发可扩展的细粒度评估工具，用于维护动态数据集中的主题相关性，所有代码和数据均已开源。

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting

Motivation: 通用大语言模型在能源等专业领域表现有限，需要深度技术专业知识和精确领域知识

Method: 使用监督微调方法，在高质量能源文本语料上微调LLaMA 3.1-8B模型，包括数据收集整理、模型微调、基准设计等完整流程

Result: EnergyGPT在大多数能源相关语言理解和生成任务上优于基础模型，证明了训练策略的有效性

Conclusion: 通过领域专业化微调，可以在不需要大规模基础设施的情况下提升模型在特定领域的相关性和性能

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various domains. However, their general-purpose nature often limits their
effectiveness in specialized fields such as energy, where deep technical
expertise and precise domain knowledge are essential. In this paper, we
introduce EnergyGPT, a domain-specialized language model tailored for the
energy sector, developed by fine-tuning LLaMA 3.1-8B model using Supervised
Fine-Tuning on a high-quality, curated corpus of energy-related texts. We
present a complete development pipeline, including data collection and
curation, model fine-tuning, benchmark design and LLM-judge choice, evaluation
and deployment. Through this work, we demonstrate that our training strategy
enables improvements in domain relevance and performance without the need for
large-scale infrastructure. By evaluating the performance of the model using
domain-specific question-answering benchmarks, our results demonstrate that
EnergyGPT outperforms the base model in most of the energy-related language
understanding and generation tasks.

TL;DR: DischargeSim是一个新的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型作为个性化出院教育者的能力，通过模拟医患对话来测试模型在六个临床出院主题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM基准测试主要关注诊断推理，而忽视了出院沟通这一关键的患者教育环节，需要评估模型在就诊后支持患者的能力。

Method: 创建DischargeSim基准，模拟多轮医患对话，使用具有不同心理社会特征的患者代理，通过自动评估、LLM作为评判者、个性化文档生成和患者理解测试来评估模型表现。

Result: 对18个LLM的实验显示出院教育能力存在显著差距，性能因患者特征而异，模型大小并不总是带来更好的教育效果。

Conclusion: DischargeSim为评估LLM在临床后访教育中的表现提供了首个基准，有助于促进公平、个性化的患者支持。

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient
care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large
language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they
fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We
introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability
to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

Motivation: 概率方法不透明且与透明性期望不一致，需要在高风险场景中解释LLM的不确定性

Method: 基于道德心理学和美德伦理学，定义预防、尊重、责任等规则，通过Prolog引擎编码，根据不确定性级别触发系统动作

Result: 场景模拟测试规则覆盖率、公平性和信任检验，在临床和法律领域应用证明可提高信任和可解释性

Conclusion: 提供了一种透明、轻量的替代方案，通过道德推理改善社会责任性的自然语言生成

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

Motivation: 传统手动注释方式限制了政治语言深度分析的范围，需要自动化复杂注释任务的方法

Method: 多种LLM模型注释德国议会辩论中的(反)团结子类型，与数千个人工注释进行对比评估，分析模型规模、提示策略、细调效果等因素

Result: 成后时期对移民展现高度团结，而2015年以来议会中反团结态度明显增强，人口衰退和劳动力短缺与气候分析并存

Conclusion: LLM在政治文本分析中具有广阔前景，德国移民辩论在人口变化和突出社会问题背景下具有重要意义

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,
where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

TL;DR: CASTLE是一种新的注意力机制，通过动态更新每个token的键值来整合后续信息，同时保持自回归特性，在语言建模任务中表现优于标准因果注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准因果注意力中每个token的QKV是静态的，只能编码前文信息，限制了模型对完整上下文的利用。

Method: 提出CASTLE机制，持续更新每个token的键值（lookahead keys），使其能够整合后续位置的信息，同时保持自回归特性，并通过数学等价实现并行训练。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，CASTLE在不同规模的模型上都优于标准因果注意力，降低了验证困惑度，并在一系列下游任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: CASTLE通过动态更新键值来整合后续信息，有效提升了语言模型的性能，同时保持了训练效率。

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

Motivation: 测试BVM方法在语言嵌入中判断图像状态变化的能力，并与现有方法进行比较

Method: 使用MIT-States数据集（53,000张图像，225个名词和115个形容词），通过BVM方法进行名词状态分类和形容词区分实验，并与余弦相似度、点积、产品量化、二进制索引、朴素贝叶斯、自定义神经网络和逻辑回归等方法对比

Result: BVM在名词状态分类中表现最佳，但在形容词区分方面未能超越逻辑回归模型

Conclusion: BVM方法在名词状态分类上有优势，但在形容词区分方面需要进一步改进方法以提高准确性

Abstract: We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis
Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through
using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about
53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

Result: 在11个长文本数据集/任务上进行评估，包含多个LLM模垃圾基准线和指标，证明可以有效预测长文本生成任务的指标分数

Conclusion: 提出了一个新题和有用的标准，为实践应用提供了可用的基准线方法

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

TL;DR: KAMIR是一种基于模型内部表示的数据选择方法，通过分析隐藏状态相似度来评估训练数据，无需提示工程即可应用于多种NLP任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SFT训练中数据选择方法依赖提示工程、成本高且适用范围有限的问题，寻求更高效通用的数据选择方案。

Method: 通过计算模型各层隐藏状态与最终隐藏状态的相似度来评估数据，基于模型对输入的熟悉程度选择训练数据。

Result: 实验表明，使用不太熟悉的数据进行训练可以获得更好的泛化性能，且方法适用于机器阅读理解、摘要生成等多种任务。

Conclusion: KAMIR提供了一种有效的数据选择方法，能够提升模型性能且适用范围更广，为SFT训练数据选择提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity

Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less

TL;DR: 提出了SAOBP框架，通过信念传播注入多跳关系来解决自注意力机制的局部化问题，引入GTD指标量化多跳连接贡献，在深层防止熵崩溃并提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer自注意力机制存在局部化问题，注意力集中在有限token子集上，难以捕获长距离依赖关系

Method: 提出Self-Attention One-step Belief Propagation (SAOBP)框架，通过信念传播过程注入多跳关系，并引入Global Token Dependency (GTD)指标来量化和解释这些交互

Result: SAOBP有助于防止深层熵崩溃，自适应地将GTD维持在任务适当水平，支持模型性能提升，特别在小规模模型中观察到竞争性增益

Conclusion: SAOBP框架有效解决了自注意力局部化问题，在资源受限场景下具有改善推理质量的潜力

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaFuse是一个新颖的LLM后训练框架，通过混合专家架构和动态路由网络，使LLM能够根据不同情境适应和表达不同个性，显著提升社交情感智能而不牺牲通用推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在现实对话中表现出情感感知和社交能力的局限性，无法根据不同社交和任务情境调整沟通风格和情感表达，需要开发更具人性化的AI系统。

Method: 基于特质激活理论和五大人格模型，采用混合专家架构，结合个性适配器和动态路由网络，实现情境化的特质表达。

Result: 在社交情感智能多个维度上显著优于基线模型，在下游人本应用（如心理健康咨询和客户服务）中表现一致提升，人类偏好评估显示与大型LLM竞争性表现。

Conclusion: PersonaFuse提供了一个理论基础扎实且实用的方法，用于开发社交情感增强的LLM，标志着向更人性化AI系统的重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注词汇、语法等语言能力，缺乏对LLM通过模式识别和交互反馈学习语言的能力评估，这是人类语言获取的核心特征。

Method: 构建新语言Tinkatongue，让LLM代理与只理解该语言的机器人进行对话交互，评估其学习和使用新语言的能力。

Result: LLM代理在100次回复内无法成功建立对话，但它们采用了与人类语言学习相似的策略，包括模仿、识别模式等。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM语言学习能力评估提供了新方向，并为设计能更有效从交互反馈中学习的模型开启了新途径。

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation
within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human
approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for
evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more
effectively from interactive feedback.

Motivation: 现有的知识图集成方法多依赖于专有或极大模型，限制了可访问性和可扩展性，而小型语言模型在知识图遍历和推理能力上存在显著局限

Method: 提出使用简单高效的探索模块来处理知识图遍历，代替语言模型本身进行图遍历

Result: 实验结果表明，这些轻量级模块有效提升了小型语言模型在知识图问答任务上的表现

Conclusion: 通过为小型模型添加专门的知识图遍历模块，可以充分发挥小模型的潜力，在保持轻量化的同时提高知识图相关任务的性能

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视了长上下文场景下的情感智能评估，特别是在现实、实用的设置中，交互往往是冗长、多样且嘈杂的。

Method: 提出了Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)方法，利用对话上下文和LLM本身作为检索源；以及Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM)方法，将任务分解为五个阶段，整合检索增强和有限知识注入。

Result: 实验结果表明，RAG和CoEM方法在大多数长上下文任务中都能持续提升情感智能相关性能，推动LLMs向更实用和真实世界的情感智能应用发展。

Conclusion: LongEmotion基准测试填补了长上下文情感智能评估的空白，提出的RAG和CoEM方法有效提升了LLMs在现实场景中的情感智能表现，为实际应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks
tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially
under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,
and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present
LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It
covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion
Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

investigate how candy speech can be reliably detected in a 46k-comment German
YouTube corpus by monolingual and multilingual language models, including
GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, and XLM-RoBERTa. We find that a multilingual
XLM-RoBERTa-Large model trained to detect candy speech at the span level
outperforms other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1: 0.8906)
and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) subtasks at the
GermEval 2025 Shared Task on Candy Speech Detection. We speculate that
span-based training, multilingual capabilities, and emoji-aware tokenizers
improved detection performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
multilingual models in identifying positive, supportive language.

Motivation: 医疗污名化语言导致医疗不平等，但目前缺乏普遍接受的标准词典来定义医疗环境中的污名化语言，需要系统分析现有词典以推动标准化。

Method: 通过系统性文献检索识别现有污名化语言词典，进行对比分析：1) 词典间的相似性和差异；2) 基于既定情感数据集分析术语的正负中性分布。

Result: 识别出4个词典，分析显示它们具有中度语义相似性，大多数污名化术语涉及临床医生描述感知负面行为的评判性表达。情感分析显示负面分类术语占主导，但各词典间存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了标准化词典的必要性，并凸显了在临床文本中定义污名化语言所面临的挑战。

Abstract: Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no
universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or
phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

effects of data augmentation techniques in improving translation systems in
low-resource African languages. We focus on two data augmentation techniques:
sentence concatenation with back translation and switch-out, applying them
across six African languages. Our experiments show significant improvements in
machine translation performance, with a minimum increase of 25\% in BLEU score
across all six languages.We provide a comprehensive analysis and highlight the
potential of these techniques to improve machine translation systems for
low-resource languages, contributing to the development of more robust
translation systems for under-resourced languages.

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text
is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models.
We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language
Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used
to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,
and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities
enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for
balancing model performance with safety requirements.

Motivation: 当前科学领域的实体识别任务依赖LLM微调，但微调成本高昂。需要找到性能与成本的最佳平衡点，减少标注开销。

Method: 提出三阶段主动学习框架：1）使用不同策略选择信息样本 2）构建真实检索语料库 3）用于LLM上下文学习。通过三种不同的主动学习策略顺序选择样本。

Result: 在三个专业领域数据集上，ALLabel在相同标注预算下始终优于所有基线方法。仅标注5%-10%的数据就能达到全量标注方法的可比性能。

Conclusion: ALLabel框架有效降低了LLM实体识别的标注成本，具有良好的有效性和泛化能力，为科学领域数据驱动研究提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

Result: 在不可信场景下将平均步骤成功率提高了20.64%，且不影响正常性能表现

Conclusion: VeriOS-Agent展现出良好的合理性、泛化性和可扩展性，为可信赖的操作系统代理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system
(OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed
for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present
untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such
scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that
enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task
completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy
OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the
decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves
the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over
the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis
highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The

Motivation: 大型语言模型知识快速过时，重新训练成本高，需要参数不变的知识编辑方法。现有基于检索增强生成的方法在简单知识编辑上表现良好，但在多跳问答中存在编辑跳过问题。

Method: 提出迭代检索增强知识编辑方法(IRAKE)，通过单编辑事实和完整编辑案例的引导进行分解，解决粒度不匹配和自然语言表达多样性导致的编辑跳过问题。

Result: 实验结果表明IRAKE有效缓解了编辑跳过导致的编辑失败，在多跳问答知识编辑任务上优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: IRAKE方法通过引导分解和迭代检索机制，成功解决了多跳问答中知识编辑的挑战，为参数不变的知识更新提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床报告通常冗长且充满专业术语，使得领域专家难以高效识别文档中的重要内容，影响了医患之间的有效沟通和共享决策。

Method: 采用迭代自提示技术(ISP)，通过让大型语言模型生成任务特定的提示并通过基于示例的小样本学习进行精炼，同时使用ROUGE和BERT-score等词汇和嵌入空间指标来指导模型微调。

Result: 在3,396份临床病例报告上的官方评估显示，使用视角感知ISP的GPT-4和GPT-4o获得了ROUGE分数(46.53, 24.68, 30.77)和BERT分数(87.84, 83.25, 85.46)，高BERT分数表明模型产生了语义等效的输出摘要。

Conclusion: 视角感知ISP技术可以有效地应用于临床报告摘要，支持更好的医患沟通，尽管在精确词汇层面的重叠度较低，但语义保持效果良好。

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

TL;DR: MoLoRAG是一个逻辑感知的检索框架，通过构建页面图来捕获页面间的上下文关系，结合语义和逻辑相关性进行更准确的多模态多页文档检索，显著提升了文档问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将文档转换为文本处理会丢失多模态信息（如图表），而大型视觉语言模型受限于输入长度无法处理多页文档。现有的检索增强生成方法仅依赖语义相关性，忽略了页面间的逻辑连接对推理的重要性。

Method: 构建页面图捕获页面间上下文关系，使用轻量级视觉语言模型进行图遍历检索相关页面（包括有逻辑连接的页面），结合语义和逻辑相关性。提供无需训练的部署方案和微调版本两种变体。

Result: 在四个文档问答数据集上，相比LVLM直接推理平均准确率提升9.68%，相比基线方法检索精度提升7.44%。

Conclusion: MoLoRAG通过逻辑感知的检索框架有效解决了多模态多页文档理解中的逻辑连接缺失问题，显著提升了文档问答性能，并提供了灵活的部署方案。

Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad
applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task.
Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large
Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at

*Zexuan Li,Hongliang Dai,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了M-BRe框架，通过关系分组、关系提取和标签决策三个模块，结合多分类和二分类的优势，从未标注文本中高效提取关系抽取的训练样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关系抽取中手动标注训练数据成本高昂，目标关系在文本中稀少且难以发现。现有LLM方法在多分类设置下难以全面捕捉关系语义，而二分类方法计算开销过大

Method: M-BRe框架包含三个模块：关系分组模块将相似关系聚类，关系提取模块使用二分类进行精确提取，标签决策模块整合结果生成高质量训练样本

Result: 大量实验证实该框架能够从未标注文本中发现高质量的关系抽取训练样本，性能优越

Conclusion: M-BRe框架有效解决了LLM在关系抽取中的语义捕捉不全面和计算复杂度高的问题，为关系抽取提供了高效的自动训练样本提取方案

Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 医疗领域水印技术存在事实性风险，现有方法在低熵异情况下会对医学实体表达造成显著损害，需要领域特定的水印方案来保护医疗内容的整体性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗等敏感领域的应用，水印技术的可靠性成为关键问题。现有评测标准偏重检测质量的权衡，而忽视了在低熵异情况下的事实性风险。

Method: 提出了一个医疗专门的评估流程，聚焦于事实准确性和连贯性的综合评估。使用GPT-Judger和人工验证，引入了事实性权重分数（FWS）这个组合指标，优先考虑事实准确性而非仅是连贯性。

Result: 评估结果显示，当前的水印方法在医疗事实性方面存在显著问题，熵异移动会对医学实体表达造成劣化效果。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了开发领域意识的水印方法的必要性，以保持医疗内容的整体性和可靠性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as
medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance
and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

TL;DR: 本研究对大型语言模型在假新闻、有害内容和政治偏见检测方面的性能进行了全面基准测试，涵盖10个数据集、5种语言，比较了微调和上下文学习两种策略，发现微调通常优于上下文学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台上的假新闻、极化内容和有害信息传播已成为严重问题，虽然大语言模型是很有前景的解决方案，但缺乏对不同模型、使用方法和语言的系统性性能评估。

Method: 使用10个数据集和5种语言（英语、西班牙语、葡萄牙语、阿拉伯语和保加利亚语），测试了参数高效微调和多种上下文学习策略（零样本提示、代码本、少样本学习、思维链等）。

Result: 上下文学习通常表现不如模型微调，即使是较小的微调模型在任务特定设置下也优于最大的上下文学习模型（如LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct等）。

Conclusion: 微调在检测超党派和假新闻、有害推文及政治偏见方面比上下文学习更有效，强调了在任务特定场景下对模型进行微调的重要性。

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content
on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models
becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study
presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation
paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and
political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages
(English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and
multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging
from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms
when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the
importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even
when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup -
in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据集局限于特定章节标注的问题，提供完整的科学文献结构化信息抽取基准。

Method: 构建包含60篇NLP领域全文本的人工标注数据集，进行对比实验验证有效性，并训练模型自动构建知识图谱。

Result: 现有模型在不同长度学术文本上表现各异，SciNLP在某些基线模型上实现显著性能提升，构建的知识图谱平均节点度为3.2。

Conclusion: SciNLP填补了NLP领域全文本标注数据集的空白，为科学文献结构化信息抽取提供了有效基准，支持下游应用发展。

Abstract: Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for
capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While
existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication
sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific
texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized
benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text
NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to
existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations
of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the
effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar
datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on
this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models
across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing
datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on
certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented
automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.
Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic
topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.

TL;DR: 该论文提出DK2R方法，通过利用结构化属性和非结构化评论知识，结合大语言模型来提升多模态任务导向对话系统中的文本响应生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个局限：1）忽视非结构化评论知识；2）未充分利用大语言模型。因此需要充分利用双重知识来促进多模态对话系统的文本响应生成。

Method: 提出双知识增强的两阶段推理器DK2R，首先从外部知识库提取结构化和非结构化知识，然后使用LLM评估各知识类型的效用，并通过专门的推理分别总结意图导向的关键线索来增强响应生成。

Result: 在公共数据集上的大量实验验证了DK2R的优越性。

Conclusion: DK2R方法有效解决了动态知识类型选择和意图-响应解耦两个关键挑战，显著提升了多模态任务导向对话系统的文本响应生成性能。

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模开源模型在文学翻译这一复杂任务中的性能问题，特别是为罗马尼亚语等低资源语言提供高质量的文学翻译数据集和模型。

Method: 采用两阶段微调流程：首先使用高性能LLM生成15k高质量罗马尼亚语参考译文，然后对12B参数开源模型进行指令微调以捕捉特定体裁叙事风格，最后使用适配器压缩实现高效部署。

Result: 微调后的模型在流畅性和准确性方面与顶级专有大模型竞争，同时具有开源、易获取和显著成本效益的优势。

Conclusion: TF2提供了一个端到端、可复现的管道，为成本效益翻译、跨语言叙事生成研究以及在低资源环境下广泛采用开源模型处理文化重要文学内容奠定了基础。

Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM输出不稳定性中的提示脆弱性问题是否也存在于人类标注者中，以确定这种脆弱性是否应该被视为问题，还是正确反映了人类标注的方差。

Method: 通过设计文本分类任务，对LLM和人类标注者使用相同的指令修改，系统比较提示修改对两者的影响。

Result: 发现人类和LLM都对替代标签集或标签格式的替换等特定提示修改表现出增加的脆弱性，但人类判断分布受拼写错误和反转标签顺序的影响小于LLM。

Conclusion: 提示脆弱性并非LLM独有，人类标注者也表现出类似敏感性，但人类在某些方面（如拼写错误和标签顺序）更具鲁棒性。

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

Result: 方法在偏见检测、分类和缓解方面表现有效，最终获得47.90%的平均得分，在共享任务中排名第四

Conclusion: 提出的基于LLM微调和多策略集成的方法能有效处理中文句子级性别偏见问题，为自然语言生成的公平性提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

Method: 构建Biased Tales数据集，分析LLM生成故事中主角属性和故事元素如何受到偏见影响

Result: 发现显著差异：女孩主角外貌相关属性增加55.26%；非西方儿童故事过度强调文化遗产、传统和家庭主题

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了社会文化偏见在使创意AI使用更加公平和多样化方面的重要作用

Abstract: Stories play a pivotal role in human communication, shaping beliefs and
morals, particularly in children. As parents increasingly rely on large
language models (LLMs) to craft bedtime stories, the presence of cultural and
gender stereotypes in these narratives raises significant concerns. To address
this issue, we present Biased Tales, a comprehensive dataset designed to
analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in
LLM-generated stories. Our analysis uncovers striking disparities. When the
protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes
far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of
sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

up to 29% higher AUROC than semantic entropy-based approaches and reduces
calibration errors by over 15%, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖监督微调合成数据，鼓励教师强制模仿而非探索和泛化，无法有效激活并行思维能力

Method: 首先在简单任务上使用SFT训练并行思维基础，然后通过RL在复杂问题上探索和泛化该能力，采用渐进式课程学习解决冷启动

Result: 在MATH、AMC23、AIME等数学基准上提升8.4%准确率，在AIME25上相比基线提升42.9%，模型思维行为从探索策略转变为多视角验证

Conclusion: 并行思维可作为训练中的探索支架，临时探索阶段能够解锁更高的性能上限，证明了RL训练并行思维的有效性

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are

new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLO和Vision Transformer的多模态融合架构，结合图像和音频信息进行铁路缺陷检测，相比单模态方法精度提升0.2个点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态检测方法在铁路结构元素检测中存在过检测问题，当正常结构元素外观相似时表现不佳，需要多模态信息融合来提高检测精度

Method: 基于领域规则构建多模态融合架构，集成YOLOv8n进行快速目标检测，结合Vision Transformer从多个层级（7、16、19）提取特征图，并与合成的音频表示进行融合，针对铁路断裂和表面缺陷两类缺陷

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上的实验表明，多模态融合相比纯视觉方法精度和整体准确率提升0.2个点，学生非配对t检验证实了平均准确率差异的统计显著性

Conclusion: 提出的多模态融合方法有效解决了铁路缺陷检测中的过检测问题，通过结合图像和音频信息显著提升了检测性能

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的后处理OOD检测方法ClaFR，通过分类器权重正交分解获得类已知子空间，计算特征重构误差来实现OOD检测，在多个基准测试中达到领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于特征的后处理方法通常需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景下不适用。需要开发不依赖训练数据的OOD检测方法。

Method: ClaFR方法：1）对分类器权重进行正交分解提取类已知子空间；2）将原始特征映射到该子空间获得新表示；3）计算子空间内的特征重构误差作为OOD分数。

Result: 在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先性能，且不需要访问训练数据。

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理OOD检测方法，解决了训练数据访问限制的问题，在保护数据隐私的同时实现了优异的检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一个简单的持续预训练策略，可以在小规模数据集上有效调整基础模型到新领域，无需标签和额外超参数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业领域中，可用数据集往往很小，限制了SSL方法的应用，且预训练模型通常只发布骨干权重，缺乏继续预训练的重要信息

Method: 提出DIET-CP策略，使用简单的目标函数，无需标签，不引入比监督微调更多的超参数，可以将任何强基础模型引导到新的数据分布

Result: 该方法在不同数据模态和骨干选择上表现稳定，仅使用1000张图像就能为DINOv3等最先进模型带来显著性能提升

Conclusion: DIET-CP为小规模专业领域数据集上的持续预训练提供了简单有效的解决方案

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种新的联邦对抗提示调优方法，通过类别感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略，有效解决了非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题，显著提升了联邦提示调优的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦提示调优(FPT)方法虽然高效，但在对抗攻击下容易导致下游任务错误分类。特别是在非IID设置下，存在客户端与全局模型之间的类别信息差距问题，需要新的方法来提升对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了FedAPT方法，包括：1) 类别感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为引导生成视觉提示；2) 跨层生成器共享策略，增强不同模型层间的提示耦合。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedAPT在提升对抗鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法，并在跨域和跨数据集场景中展现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedAPT通过解决非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题，有效提升了联邦提示调优的对抗鲁棒性，具有很好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于选择题和合成数据的基准测试无法反映企业实际应用需求，如社交媒体内容分析的复杂性，需要建立更贴近企业部署的评估框架。

Method: 提出ViLD框架，定义10个业务关键任务，开发BlockWeaver算法处理无序OCR输出比较，构建7500个真实样本数据集，结合语义匹配、传统指标和新方法进行评估。

Result: 在Qwen、MIMO和InternVL等开源VLM模型上进行了行业基础的、任务驱动的能力评估，为企业在实际环境中部署VLM提供了可行见解。

Conclusion: ViLD框架成功连接了学术研究与企业需求，通过全面的评估方法和真实数据集，为开源视觉语言模型的企业级应用提供了可靠的评估基准和部署指导。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一个自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头部信息来学习协议相关性，在多个医学影像任务上显著提升了外部验证性能和校准能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统处理，扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响图像对比度、噪声和伪影，这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了仅基于图像的神经网络在不同站点间的泛化能力。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头部作为标签，通过三种方式学习协议感知但临床鲁棒的图像表示：(1)协议-图像对比学习，(2)掩码协议预测，(3)协议-协议转换。使用126万项研究数据进行训练。

Result: 在三个临床任务上表现优异：肺栓塞CT分诊（AUROC提升0.046）、脑胶质瘤MRI分级（提升0.058）、心胸比X光检测（提升0.041），外部验证AUROC达0.901，校准误差降低25-37%。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome方法能有效利用DICOM协议信息提升医学影像AI模型的泛化能力和校准性能，减少协议边界处的假阳性，适用于临床PACS系统部署。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

Motivation: 研究人类在文字识别方面展现出的惊人韧性（能够识别破碎、融合或部分遮挡的文字），并探究先进的视觉语言模型是否具备类似的鲁棒性。

Method: 构建两个受心理物理学启发的基准测试，涵盖中文象形文字和英文字母文字，通过分割、重组和叠加字形来创建对人类可读但对模型"可见但不可读"的刺激材料。

Result: 尽管在清晰文本上表现强劲，但当代视觉语言模型在这些扰动下表现严重下降，经常产生不相关或不连贯的输出，表明模型过度依赖通用视觉不变性而忽视了组合先验。

Conclusion: 研究结果呼吁开发能够编码符号分割、组合和跨脚本绑定的架构和训练策略，为教育、无障碍、文化遗产和安全等领域的多模态系统部署指明了具体挑战。

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在低数据量情况下具有很强的生成能力

Conclusion: 该方法具有缓解动态MRI重建中数据稀缺问题的实际潜力

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

Conclusion: MEGS²通过联合优化图元数量和参数效率，有效解决了3D高斯泼溅的内存瓶颈问题，为边缘设备部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Conclusion: 该空间-频域组合正则化框架为文本到图像模型潜在空间的优化提供了高效的正则化手段，具有更好的性能和更低的计算复杂度

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

### [86] [Automated Evaluation of Gender Bias Across 13 Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07050)
*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Aymara图像公平性评估基准，用于评估AI生成图像中的社会偏见，发现大型多模态模型不仅复制而且放大了职业性别刻板印象，存在显著的默认男性偏见，且不同模型的偏见程度差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然发现了多模态模型中的性别偏见，但方法学限制阻碍了大规模、可比较的跨模型分析。需要开发标准化评估工具来促进AI开发的问责制和公平性。

Method: 使用75个程序生成的性别中性提示词，测试13个商业可用的大型多模态模型，生成 stereotypically-male、stereotypically-female 和非刻板印象职业的人物图像，然后使用经过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张生成图像进行性别代表性评分。

Result: 1) LMMs系统性地复制并放大了职业性别刻板印象（男性在男性刻板职业中占93.0%，女性刻板职业中仅22.5%）；2) 模型表现出强烈的默认男性偏见（非刻板职业中男性占68.3%）；3) 不同模型的偏见程度差异显著（总体男性代表性从46.7%到73.3%不等）。

Conclusion: 高度偏见并非不可避免的结果，而是设计选择的结果。最佳性能模型能够去放大性别刻板印象并接近性别平等，获得了最高的公平性分数。这项工作提供了迄今为止最全面的跨模型性别偏见基准，强调了标准化自动化评估工具的必要性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

*Chung-Shien Brian Wang,Christian Schmidt,Jens Piekenbrinck,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于块稀疏核的注意力机制替代方案，用于解决多视图重建中transformer模型的二次复杂度瓶颈问题，实现了4倍推理加速且性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的transformer-based多视图重建模型（如VGGT和π³）虽然效果出色，但由于全局注意力层的二次复杂度，在处理大规模图像集时存在运行时瓶颈。通过分析发现注意力矩阵的概率质量集中在少数与跨视图几何匹配对应的patch-patch交互上。

Method: 受结构化注意力和大语言模型最新进展的启发，提出了基于高度优化的块稀疏核来替代密集全局注意力操作的方法。该方法无需重新训练主干网络，适用于VGGT和π³模型，并支持大规模图像集合。

Result: 在全面的多视图基准测试中，该方法实现了高达4倍的推理加速，同时保持了相当的任务性能。

Conclusion: 提出的块稀疏注意力机制有效解决了多视图重建中transformer模型的扩展性问题，为大规模图像集处理提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究边缘服务器上视觉惯性里程计(VIO)的位姿欺骗威胁，提出无监督检测与恢复机制，通过攻击无关会话学习运动规律来检测运行时偏差并恢复位姿一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将VIO卸载到边缘服务器的趋势会扩大服务器端威胁面，细微的位姿欺骗可能累积成显著漂移，同时规避启发式检查。

Method: 提出无监督、无标签的检测和恢复机制，在无攻击会话上训练模型学习运动的时间规律性，检测运行时偏差并启动恢复以恢复位姿一致性。

Result: 在ILLIXR测试床上使用多种欺骗强度进行评估，实验结果显示与无防御基线相比，轨迹和位姿误差显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测和恢复VIO系统中的位姿欺骗攻击，提高系统安全性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

Motivation: 研究人脸增强技术在提升面部外观的同时，是否会歪曲生物识别特征并降低深作偷检测器的准确性

Method: 系统性评估传统图像处理方法和GAN基础增强技术对深作偷检测器程度的影响，分析对程度、空间和频率基检测方法的效果，并进行对抗训练实验

Result: 基础增强滤镜可将检测准确率降低至64.63%，GAN基技术更能达到75.12%的攻击成功率，显示了深作偷检测器的漏洞

Conclusion: 人脸增强技术可以有效地作为反例证工具，强调了开发更强固和适应性强的例证方法的必要性

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习需要大量标注数据，但在开放世界场景中，新类别可能随时出现，传统方法难以处理。现有工作主要关注半监督方法，但本文探索完全无监督的新类发现方案。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers通过注意力机制生成向量嵌入，结合流形学习技术利用数据内在几何结构优化嵌入表示，提升图像聚类性能。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Tiny ImageNet数据集上实现了单模态聚类和新类发现的最先进结果，无论聚类数量是否已知。

Conclusion: 提出的完全无监督方法在开放世界场景中有效发现了新类别，为无监督学习在新类发现任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

### [91] [XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal Vision-Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07213)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet是一种双提示、双分支多模态模型，通过结合全局语义和局部边界精确性，实现了精准的乳腺超声分割，尤其在小、低对比度病变上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺超声分割对于可靠测量和定量分析至关重要，但小或低对比度病变因模糊边缘和斑点噪声而难以准确分割。文本提示能提供临床上下文，但直接应用弱定位文本-56fe像线索容易产生粗糕的分割结果。

Method: 设计XBusNet双提示双分支模型：全局途径基于CLIP Vision Transformer编码整图语义，局部U-Net途径重点具体边界，通过描述形状、边缘和BI-RADS术语的提示进行调制。提示从结构化元数据自动生成，无需手动点击。

Result: 在BLU数据集上达到最高水平，平均Dice系数0.8765，IoU系数0.8149，超越6个强基线。小病变收益最大，缺失区域和假阻性激活更少。分离研究证明全局上下文、局部边界建模和提示调制具有补充性作用。

Conclusion: 双提示双分支多模态设计能够结合全局语义和局部精确性，产生准确的乳腺超声分割面具，提高对小、低对比度病变的验证性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Result: 达到98.0%准确率和98.1%敏感度，显著优于传统方法和ProGAN基线

Conclusion: 高级生成模型与可解释特征的协同效应能构建高准确医学诊断工具

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练依赖图像-文本对，但标注通常稀疏且缺乏细粒度视觉细节，即使使用数百词描述简单图像也存在信息缺失问题

Method: RecA利用模型自身的视觉理解嵌入作为条件，通过自监督重建损失优化图像重建，实现理解与生成的对齐

Result: 仅用27 GPU小时，在GenEval(0.73→0.90)和DPGBench(80.93→88.15)上大幅提升生成性能，编辑基准也有显著改善(ImgEdit 3.38→3.75, GEdit 6.94→7.25)，超越更大开源模型

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于多种UMM架构，包括自回归、掩码自回归和基于扩散的模型

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Method: 设计双域增强模块(DDE)包含跨尺度小波Mamba(CSWM)和傅里叶细节恢复块(FDR)来增强低光照图像；设计优先级引导Mamba融合模块(PGMF)通过优先级扫描从局部目标特征开始融合，减少冗余信息影响

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上的实验表明，DEPF在目标检测任务上表现优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 基于线性复杂度的Mamba架构，DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键挑战，在保持高性能的同时降低了计算复杂度

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

Method: 结合高斯滤波器优化骨架拓扑图表示，并集成门控循环单元(GRU)到GCN框架中增强骨架点间信息传播

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120和NW-UCLA基准测试中显著提升动作识别性能，特别是对模糊样本效果明显

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN方法通过拓扑优化和门控机制有效解决了骨架动作识别中的模糊动作区分问题，具有良好的泛化能力

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Motivation: 现有解析图方法主要关注单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力。语言提供了丰富的空间关系先验，但现有的全局特征融合方法会削弱遮挡区域响应并导致对齐和定位失败

Method: 提出基于解析图的视觉-语言交互框架(PGVL)，包含引导模块(GM)。低层节点关注局部特征保持遮挡区域响应，高层节点整合全局特征推断遮挡部分。采用自上而下分解和自下而上组合的两阶段方法，包含模态特定解析图构建和递归双向交叉注意力机制

Result: 在主要姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL和所提网络的有效性

Conclusion: PGVL通过有效的多模态融合和引导机制，解决了遮挡场景下人体姿态估计的挑战，代码即将发布

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

Motivation: 现有的3D生成方法主要关注几何建模，将纹理烘焙为简单顶点颜色或依赖后处理的图像扩散模型，缺乏端到端的PBR材质生成能力。

Method: 采用模块化设计：LGAA Wrapper重用多视角扩散模型层、LGAA Switcher对齐多个扩散先验、LGAA Decoder预测带PBR通道的2D高斯泼溅，最后通过后处理提取高质量可重光照网格资产。

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the

*Taiying Peng,Jiacheng Hua,Miao Liu,Feng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoGazeVQA基准测试，利用注视信息提升多模态大语言模型在自我中心视频中的意图理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视了注视作为用户意图指示器的重要作用，自我中心视频通过统一坐标系捕获用户焦点、动作和上下文，为个性化AI体验提供了机会

Method: 构建了基于注视的问答对数据集，采用注视引导的意图提示方法整合空间、时间和意图相关线索，并进行注视相关的微调实验

Result: 现有MLLMs难以准确解释用户意图，而注视引导方法显著提升了性能，注视估计准确性影响提示效果

Conclusion: 注视信息对于在自我中心环境中实现更个性化和有效的AI助手具有重要价值

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XOCT是一个深度学习框架，通过跨维度监督和多尺度特征融合实现从OCT到OCTA的层感知血管重建，显著提升了视网膜血管重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCTA图像获取困难且成本高，现有深度学习方法忽略视网膜层间血管差异，难以重建诊断所需的精细血管细节。

Method: 提出跨维度监督模块利用2D分层投影作为监督信号，结合多尺度特征融合模块通过通道重加权策略增强血管描绘。

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上实验证明XOCT显著提升了en-face投影质量，这对视网膜病理临床评估至关重要。

Conclusion: XOCT有潜力提高OCTA的可及性、可靠性和诊断价值，用于眼科疾病的检测和监测。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

Method: 采用GF-1 WFV和Landsat TM占图，使用Swin Transformer通过注意力机制提取全局特征，将碳储量估算转化为图像转换问题

Result: 未在摘要中明确提及，但方法设计目的是提高森林碳储量估算的准确性

Conclusion: 使用Swin Transformer和风格转换方法可以为大规模森林碳储量监测提供更准确的技术支持

Abstract: Forests function as crucial carbon reservoirs on land, and their carbon sinks
can efficiently reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations and mitigate climate
change. Currently, the overall trend for monitoring and assessing forest carbon
stocks is to integrate ground monitoring sample data with satellite remote
sensing imagery. This style of analysis facilitates large-scale observation.
However, these techniques require improvement in accuracy. We used GF-1 WFV and
Landsat TM images to analyze Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province in
China. Using the style transfer method, we introduced Swin Transformer to
extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon
stock estimation into an image translation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器遗忘技术的偏置缓解方法，通过选择性移除训练数据中的偏置样本或特征表示，在不需要重新训练的情况下显著提升视觉模型的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络容易学习训练数据中的虚假相关性，导致在医疗和自动驾驶等安全关键领域产生有偏或不公平的预测。传统偏置缓解方法需要从头重新训练或重新设计数据管道，成本高昂。

Method: 基于隐私保护遗忘技术，评估了梯度上升、LoRA和师生蒸馏等多种策略，在CUB-200-2011（姿态偏置）、CIFAR-10（合成补丁偏置）和CelebA（微笑检测中的性别偏置）三个基准数据集上进行实证分析。

Result: 后处理遗忘方法显著减少了子群体差异，在CUB-200上人口统计公平性提升94.86%，CIFAR-10提升30.28%，CelebA提升97.37%，准确率损失最小，在效用、公平性、质量和隐私的联合评估中平均得分0.62。

Conclusion: 机器遗忘技术为增强已部署视觉系统的公平性提供了一个实用框架，无需进行完整的重新训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在放射图像分类中表现出色但解释性差，限制了临床接受度。需要开发能够透明归因决策到图像特定区域的自解释模型。

Method: 将图像分割成不重叠的补丁，独立分类每个补丁，然后聚合预测结果，无需后处理技术即可直观可视化每个补丁的诊断贡献。

present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image

independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without
post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images),
MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks
associated with shortcut learning, thus improving clinical trust. Our model is

Result: 实验结果验证了方法的有效性，能够生成生动自然的向量图形动画，在灵活性和动画质量方面显著改进现有技术

Conclusion: 该方法成功埋平了向量图形与沉硅模型之间的领域差距，为自动生成高质量向量图形动画提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually
impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural

to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and
language models to generate step-by-step navigational instructions, enhancing
accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose
an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional
and sequential variables, providing a more comprehensive measure of
navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved
in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original
BLIP-2 model.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在渲染方面表现出色，但由于表示的无结构性和缺乏显式几何监督，难以实现准确完整的表面重建

Method: 为每个高斯关联可学习的SDF值，设计几何引导的多尺度网格增长策略，自适应地在几何一致区域分布高斯

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS一致提高了重建精度和完整性，同时保持高渲染保真度

Conclusion: DiGS通过将SDF学习与3DGS结合，实现了更好的表面重建效果，为3D重建和渲染提供了统一的解决方案

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了深度网络对抗性攻击的转移性和效果，为遥感应用安全提供了重要技术支撑

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Conclusion: MVAT框架通过有效利用时序多视角信息，成功解决了弱监督3D检测中的投影歧义和部分可见性问题，无需3D标注即可获得高质量结果

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Hounsfield Unit的前景掩码策略，用于改进3D医学图像中的掩码图像建模，通过关注内脏器官的强度分布来提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的随机掩码策略在3D医学图像计算中忽视了解剖对象的密度特性，无法充分利用医学图像中具有诊断意义的特征区域。

Method: 利用Hounsfield Unit测量值实现基于HU的前景掩码，专注于内脏器官的强度分布，排除空气和液体等非组织区域。

Result: 在五个公开3D医学影像数据集上实验表明，该方法显著提升了分割质量和Dice分数（BTCV:84.64%, Flare22:92.43%, MM-WHS:90.67%, Amos22:88.64%, BraTS:78.55%）。

Conclusion: 基于领域特性的掩码图像建模在医学图像分割表示学习中具有重要价值，为医学图像分析提供了有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档图像蕴含丰富知识，语音查询具有便携性和灵活性，但此前没有工作探索在视觉文档图像上直接使用语音查询进行知识库问答。

Method: 提出完全无文本的端到端框架，直接解释语音、检索相关视觉知识并生成答案，集成了布局感知的重排序机制来优化检索性能。

Result: 实验显示在效率和准确性方面都有显著提升，并发布了首个双语语音-文档RAG数据集。

Conclusion: TextlessRAG为语音文档问答开辟了新方向，提供了高效准确的无文本解决方案，相关数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

Motivation: 解决从单张无姿态图片高速重建3D全头部模型的挑战，避免传统方法的耗时GAN逆向和测试时优化

Method: 使用大规模合成3D GAN生成的综合数据集；粗细程度Gaussian头部生成流水线；双分支框架聚合结构化球面三平面特征和非结构化点基特征

Result: 实验结果显示该框架在现有工作中具有有效性

Conclusion: 该前向传播框架能够实现高速的单图3D全头部重建和渲染，为实时应用提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

Motivation: 深度学习在黑盒性质限制了其在高风险应用（如医疗和法医）中的采用，需要可解释的模型来建立信任和问责制。

Method: 使用Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT)架构，结合图注意力卷积和注意力机制，可视化注意力分布来解释决策过程。评估了局部平均曲率和质心距离等节点特征。

Result: 结合局部平均曲率和质心距离作为节点特征获得了0.76加权F1分数，性能略有提升，并产生更全面的注意力可视化。包含指向全局CLS节点的有向边能产生更直观的注意力图。

Conclusion: CGAT架构能够生成人类可理解的注意力图，增强信任并促进专家验证模型决策。虽然基于牙科数据演示，但可广泛应用于基于图的分类和回归任务，推动透明深度学习模型在高风险环境中的采用。

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Motivation: 时间图像取证是通过分析图像采集流程中引入的时间依赖性痕迹来估计数字图像年龄的科学。本文旨在全面综述该领域，验证已知年龄痕迹特性，并揭示现有方法可能存在的问题。

Method: 通过分析先前工作、重新实现所需方法并进行实验验证，包括验证传感器缺陷的主要特性（增长率和空间分布），研究神经网络学习特征，以及展示神经网络易受干扰的问题。

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

TL;DR: 提出了Visual-TableQA数据集，包含2.5k个LaTeX渲染表格和6k个推理密集型QA对，通过多模型协作生成，成本低于100美元，显著提升了视觉语言模型在表格推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在表格图像推理方面的基准测试在规模、多样性和推理深度方面存在不足，需要大规模、开放领域的多模态数据集来评估和增强复杂表格数据的视觉推理能力。

Method: 采用模块化、可扩展的全自动生成流水线，多个推理LLM在不同角色（生成、验证、启发）上协作，通过跨模型提示和LLM陪审团过滤实现多模型协作数据生成，强模型生成布局和主题，弱模型进行细化。

Conclusion: Visual-TableQA是一个有效的大规模表格视觉推理数据集，其生成方法成本低、效果好，为提升视觉语言模型的表格推理能力提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full
pipeline and resources are publicly available at

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言基础模型中的性别偏见评估存在严重问题，即使对非性别特征进行微小扰动（如遮挡10%物体或轻微模糊背景），也会导致偏见评分大幅变化，表明当前评估方法可能更多反映模型对虚假特征而非真实性别偏见的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于真实图像的性别偏见评估基准往往包含性别与非性别特征（如物体和背景）之间的虚假相关性，这可能导致性别偏见评估的失真。研究旨在探究这些虚假特征是否扭曲了性别偏见的评估结果。

Method: 系统性地对四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP和PHASE）和各种视觉语言模型中的非性别特征进行扰动，量化它们对偏见评估的影响。扰动方法包括遮挡物体和模糊背景等。

Result: 即使最小程度的扰动（如遮挡10%物体或弱模糊背景）也能显著改变偏见评分，生成式视觉语言模型的指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体变化达43%。这表明当前偏见评估往往反映的是模型对虚假特征的响应，而非真实的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 由于创建无虚假特征的基准具有根本性挑战，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量，以实现更可靠的偏见评估。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源方法存在推理模式单调、交互轮次有限的问题，难以处理需要试错探索的困难任务。

Method: 构建Visual Probe Dataset视觉探测数据集；开发迭代数据收集管道获取多样化推理模式；提出over-turn masking策略防止强化学习中惩罚超轮次响应。

Result: 在仅训练6轮交互上限的情况下，模型在推理时能自然扩展到数十轮，准确率随轮次增加而提升，在挑战性视觉搜索任务上达到state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: Mini-o3能够产生丰富的推理模式和深度思考路径，有效解决复杂视觉搜索问题，展示了大规模工具交互和深度多轮推理的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

Method: 使用数据高效微调流水线：1将结构化元数据转换为合成报告以改善图像-文本对齐；2添加预测MMSE评分的辅助token提供辅助监督；3应用轻量级提示微调技术。

Result: 在仅使用1,500张训练图像的情况下，在两个AD数据集上达到最先进性能，超过了使用10,000张图像微调的现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据高效微调和临床知识集成，有效解决了3D医学形态医学图像分析的挑战，在阿尔茫海默病诊断中表现突出。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 该方法为神经退行性疾病的MRI诊断提供了一种无需大量标签数据且具有较高可解释性的解决方案，具有良好的泛化性能

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: SFW是一种有效的框架，能够平衡水印的强化性和图像保真度，解决语义水印中的内在批执

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Conclusion: 该方法展示了有效性和泛化能力，无需对目标特征做过多假设，通过建模背景低秩结构实现鲁棒的小目标检测

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单应性变换、多网格单应性和薄板样条等方法在处理包含深度差异的真实场景时存在固有局限性，需要更有效的深度图像配准方法。

Method: 提出EDFFDNet网络，采用指数衰减基函数的自由形变设计；引入ASMA模块将密集交互转为稀疏交互；提出渐进相关细化策略进行从粗到细的运动估计。

Result: 参数减少70.5%，内存减少32.6%，总运行时间减少33.7%，PSNR提升0.5dB；增加局部细化后PSNR进一步提升1.06dB，同时保持较低计算成本。

Conclusion: EDFFDNet在深度差异场景中表现出色，具有强泛化能力，在效率和精度方面均优于现有深度学习方法。

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

*Himanshu Singh,A. V. Subramanyam,Shivank Rajput,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过在特征空间中抑制类间依赖性来提升神经网络的对抗性，该方法在保持清洁准确性的同时显著提高了对对抗性攻击的防御能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类中表现优异但容易受到对抗性样本的攻击，标准对抗训练方法没有明确处理类间特征重叠这一重要的对抗脏性来源

Method: 提出了一种新的对抗训练框架，通过在特征空间中抑制清洁和对抗性样本的类间依赖性来主动减少类间近似性。方法首先识别每个对抗性样本的最近类间邻居，然后移除在这些邻居上的投影以强化特征可分离性

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和SVHN标准数据集上进行的广泛实验显示，该方法表现出与领先对抗训练技术相竞争的强劲性能，在稳健性和清洁准确性方面都取得了显著成就

Conclusion: 研究结果表明明确处理类间特征近似性对增强深度神经网络的对抗稳健性至关重要，理论分析证明该方法通过降低神经网络的Lipschitz常数来提高泛化能力和稳健性

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

TL;DR: 通过大语言模型代理搭配视频模块，实现了复杂视频理解任务的自主决策执行


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频感知模型在复杂推理任务上表现不佳的问题，特别是当查询变得更复杂和视频更长时

Method: 构建了一个大语言模型代理，给其配备视频模块作为子代理或工具，并通过批评器区分成功与失败的执行序列

Result: 在LVBench、Neptune和ActivityNet-RTL等数据集上取得了强劲的性能表现

Conclusion: 通过结合代理机制和批评器，可以有效利用现有视频感知能力来处理更复杂的视频理解任务

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

*Chunhang Zheng,Zichang Ren,Dou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEEC提出了一种基于语义分割的多熵模型无损图像压缩方法，通过为不同语义区域分配专用熵模型来提升压缩性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法大多使用单一熵模型估计整个图像的概率分布，无法有效捕捉不同语义区域的多样化统计特征

Method: 利用语义分割识别不同区域，为每个语义区域分配专用熵模型，采用多通道离散逻辑混合似然建模像素值分布

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的压缩比，同时仅引入最小的编码和解码延迟

Conclusion: SEEC框架通过语义分割指导的多熵模型选择，显著提升了无损图像压缩性能，并支持基于分割掩码的感兴趣区域编码

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

TL;DR: 通过多模态深度学习模型，结合CTA图像和临床数据，实现了脑冷复发风险的早期检测和复发自由生存时间预测，发现心脏疾病和颈动脉是关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑冷是全球第二大死因，复发率高且死亡率极高（复发死亡率40%），通过早期检测高风险患者可以提前进行治疗干预。

Method: 收集3D脑内CTA图像数据和临床数据（心脏疾病、年龄、性别），训练单模态和多模态深度学习模型，进行二分类复发检测（Task 1）和复发自由生存时间预测（Task 2）。

Result: 单纯表格数据在复发检测任务中达到AUC 0.84；多模态模型在生存分析任务中达到c-index 0.68和AUC 0.71，视觉数据占比0.68权重，表格数据占比0.32。

Conclusion: 心脏疾病（表格数据）和颈动脉（图像数据）是预测脑冷复发的关键因素，多模态模型能够提高预测准确性，为临床治疗提供重要参考。

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

TL;DR: 基于3D高斯泼溅技术，提出了一种从多视角图像重建发丝级头发几何的新方法，通过多阶段管道实现高效准确的头发重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟现实和数字人建模应用对头发重建的需求日益增长，现有方法往往忽略发丝的连通性和拓扑结构，需要新的评估指标和方法

Method: 多阶段管道：首先使用可微分高斯光栅化器重建详细头发几何，然后通过新颖的合并方案将高斯片段合并为连贯发丝，最后在光度监督下优化和生长发丝

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能稳健处理各种发型，实现高效重建（通常在1小时内完成），并提出了评估拓扑准确性的新指标

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了3DGS框架，实现了发丝级的头发几何重建，为头发建模提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RayGaussX在RayGauss基础上进行优化，通过引入体积渲染加速策略、增强光线一致性、尺度正则化和新的致密化标准，实现了5-12倍训练加速和50-80倍渲染速度提升，同时提高了视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RayGauss虽然在新视角合成方面达到了最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本过高，无法在真实场景中实现实时渲染。

Method: 引入体积渲染加速策略（空空间跳过和自适应采样）、增强光线一致性、尺度正则化减少误报交点、提出新的致密化标准改善远距离区域密度分布。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实现5-12倍训练加速、50-80倍渲染速度提升（FPS），PSNR视觉质量提升最高达+0.56 dB。

Conclusion: RayGaussX成功解决了RayGauss的计算效率问题，在保持高质量渲染的同时实现了显著的性能提升，适用于更大规模的场景。

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种自监督的多视角神经网络方法，用于融合两个正交各异性低分辨率碱共振成像来重建统一的高分辨率解剖细节。该方法无需高分辨率数据训练，并通过病人无关的离线和病人特异的在线阶段实现了较快的重建速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学碱共振成像中，高分辨率图像获取常带来扩大扫描时间和病人不适。虽然可以获取两个不同方向的低分辨率扫描，但医生需要分别分析这些图像，这时间消耗大且容易导致误判。

Method: 提出了一种新的多视角神经网络方法，通过自监督方式训练，无需对应的高分辨率数据。使用稀疏坐标基减损函数优化模型，支持任意缩放比例的低分辨率图像融合。组合病人无关的离线阶段和病人特异的在线阶段。

Result: 在两中独立的碱共振数据集上评估，与现有自监督超分辨率方法相比，该方法在不同的上采样缩放比例下展现了相当或更优的性能。通过离线-在线组合，实现了病人特异重建速度提升达10倍，同时保持相似或更好的超分辨率质量。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的自监督多视角融合方法能够有效地从两个正交低分辨率碱共振图像中重建高分辨率解剖细节，无需高分辨率数据训练，并通过离线-在线组合实现了显著的重建速度提升，为医学图像超分辨率提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatFill是一种新颖的深度引导3D高斯溅射场景修复方法，通过联合深度监督和一致性感知精炼，实现了最先进的感知质量和更高的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射(3DGS)虽然能从多视角图像创建逼真的3D场景表示，但在修复缺失区域（遮挡或场景编辑导致）时仍存在挑战，往往产生模糊细节、伪影和几何不一致的问题。

Method: 结合两个关键思想：(1)联合深度基和对象基监督，确保修复的高斯在3D空间中准确定位并与周围几何对齐；(2)提出一致性感知精炼方案，选择性识别和修正不一致区域而不破坏场景其他部分。

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上的评估显示，SplatFill不仅在视觉保真度上超越了现有的NeRF基和3DGS基修复方法，还将训练时间减少了24.5%。定性结果显示该方法能提供更清晰的细节、更少的伪影和跨挑战性视角的更好一致性。

Conclusion: SplatFill通过深度引导和一致性感知精炼，成功解决了3DGS场景修复中的关键挑战，实现了高质量的修复效果和显著的效率提升。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型与3D点云之间的表示对齐问题，现有方法在输入输出阶段都存在表示不匹配，限制了3D分割性能

Method: 提出对象中心判别表示(OcDR)学习目标语义和场景关系的对象中心token，以及几何重激活解码器(GRD)结合LLM推理的几何信息与密集特征进行精确分割

Result: 在ScanNetv2上提升7.3 mIoU，在Multi3DRefer上提升6.0 mIoU，在7个基准测试的4个不同任务中均取得一致性能提升

Conclusion: PLM通过全面的对象中心推理有效解决了3D表示对齐问题，为鲁棒的3D理解提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

Abstract: Accurate and timely mapping of burned areas is crucial for environmental

presents a novel approach to automated burned area mapping using the AlphaEArth
dataset combined with the Siamese U-Net deep learning architecture. The
AlphaEArth Dataset, comprising high-resolution optical and thermal infrared
imagery with comprehensive ground-truth annotations, provides an unprecedented
resource for training robust burned area detection models. We trained our model
with the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) dataset in the contiguous US
and evaluated it with 17 regions cross in Europe. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach achieves superior performance
with an overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 74% on the test
dataset. The model successfully identifies burned areas across diverse
ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting
partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and
high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable
solution for global burn area monitoring using the AlphaEarth dataset.

Conclusion: D-LEAF方法能够准确定位和修正MLLM中的幻觉问题，显著提升模型性能，具有任务无关性和低计算开销的优势。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency
in AI models, facilitating stronger safeguards in AI deployments to achieve
proper security, privacy, and copyright protection.

TL;DR: OCNet通过建立支持目标对象与查询通用对象之间的对象级相关性来解决少样本语义分割中的背景噪声问题，在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要建立在支持目标对象与整个查询图像之间的图像级相关性，但这种相关性包含难以追踪和抑制的硬像素噪声（不相关的背景对象），导致背景过拟合。

Method: 设计对象级相关性网络（OCNet），包括通用对象挖掘模块（GOMM）学习显著性和高层相似性线索构建查询通用对象特征，以及相关性构建模块（CCM）通过分配目标原型来匹配通用对象特征建立对象级相关性。

Result: 在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过模仿生物视觉过程建立对象级相关性，能够有效挖掘查询目标特征并抑制硬像素噪声，在少样本语义分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Method: 提出ToothMCL多模态对比学习框架，整合体积CBCT咄表面IOS数据，通过模态不变表征学习精确模型化解剖结构

Result: 在最大的CBCT-IOS3.8K数据集上评估，DSC指标提升12%(CBCT)咄8%(IOS)，在不同牙齿组咄临床场景下均显示优异性能咄良好通用性

Conclusion: ToothMCL框架为数字化牙科提供了可靠的多模态预训练方案，能够准确识别FDI牙齿编号，推动临床应用发展

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

Motivation: 解决高性能物体检测模型在消费级硬件上实际部署时的系统级瓶颈问题

Method: 两次适配性推理算法：先使用快速低分辨率检测，仅当检测信心度低时才升级到高分辨率模型

Result: 在COCO 5000张图片数据集上，相比PyTorch Early-Exit基线速度提升1.85倍，mAP损失5.51%

Conclusion: 通过从纯粹模型优化转向硬件感知的推理策略，为消费级设备部署高性能实时AI提供了实用方案

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络内部特征提取过程的黑盒问题，通过生成与特定特征匹配的图像来揭示DNN编码的图像属性。

Method: 使用引导扩散模型，在预训练扩散模型的反向图像生成过程中最小化生成图像特征与用户指定特征之间的欧几里得距离。

Result: 实验针对CLIP图像编码器、ResNet-50和视觉变换器，生成图像的特征与指定特征高度相似，揭示了这些DNN特征空间的宝贵见解。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可分析不同DNN的特征空间，在单个商用GPU上运行，为理解神经网络内部表示提供了有效工具。

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

Motivation: 解决现实世界中任意未见物体的6D姿态估计问题，传统方法面临3D模型稀缺、单视图重建缺乏度量尺度、生成模型与真实图像存在域差距等挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1) 粗到精对齐模块，结合多视图特征匹配和渲染比较细化来联合优化尺度和姿态；2) 文本引导生成域随机化策略，通过多样化纹理实现合成数据的有效微调。

Result: 在YCBInEOAT、Toyota-Light、LM-O等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，远超先前方法，并在真实机器人手上展示了稳健的灵巧抓取能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高保真单视图3D生成支持可靠的一次性6D姿态估计，验证了在现实世界操作中的实用性，为解决长尾实例的机器人操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL是一种通过视觉表示对齐来增强多模态大语言模型视觉推理能力的正则化策略，与预训练视觉基础模型对齐以保留细粒度视觉细节


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉中心任务（如目标计数、空间推理）上表现有限，主要原因是文本监督范式只能提供对视觉通路的间接指导，导致训练过程中丢失细粒度视觉细节

Method: 提出VIRAL（Visual Representation Alignment）策略，将MLLMs的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型（VFMs）的表示进行显式对齐，既保留输入视觉编码器的关键视觉细节，又补充来自VFMs的额外视觉知识

Result: 实验表明在广泛采用的多模态基准测试的所有任务上都取得了持续改进，并通过全面的消融研究验证了关键设计选择

Conclusion: 这一简单发现为在训练MLLMs时有效整合视觉信息开辟了重要方向

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

Motivation: 传统独立噪声添加方法在查询数量和输出精度上受限，且无法保持嵌套查询的总序关系，需要新的隐私保护计数方法

Method: 基于sigma代数概念构建隐私保护计数查询框架，通过结构化噪声添加机制替代独立噪声

Result: 该方法能显著提高输出精度，在保持所需隐私级别的同时支持对同一数据的大规模查询

Conclusion: sigma-counting方法有效解决了传统隐私保护计数查询的局限性，为大规模和时变数据集提供了可行的隐私保护解决方案

Abstract: Many data applications involve counting queries, where a client specifies a
feasible range of variables and a database returns the corresponding item
counts. A program that produces the counts of different queries often risks
leaking sensitive individual-level information. A popular approach to enhance
data privacy is to return a noisy version of the actual count. It is typically
achieved by adding independent noise to each query and then control the total
privacy budget within a period. This approach may be limited in the number of
queries and output accuracy in practice. Also, the returned counts do not
maintain the total order for nested queries, an important feature in many
applications. This work presents the design and analysis of a new method,
sigma-counting, that addresses these challenges. Sigma-counting uses the notion
of sigma-algebra to construct privacy-preserving counting queries. We show that
the proposed concepts and methods can significantly improve output accuracy
while maintaining a desired privacy level in the presence of massive queries to
the same data. We also discuss how the technique can be applied to address
large and time-varying datasets.

Result: 在合成医疗风格数据库上的实验表明，系统能够在列名模糊化和部分值不匹配的情况下恢复有效连接

Conclusion: 该研究在数据集成方面具有直接应用价值，能够自动发现跨多个数据库的连接路径

Abstract: Traditional relational databases require users to manually specify join keys
and assume exact matches between column names and values. In practice, this
limits joinability across fragmented or inconsistently named tables. We propose
a fuzzy join framework that automatically identifies joinable column pairs and
traverses indirect (multi-hop) join paths across multiple databases. Our method
combines column name similarity with row-level fuzzy value overlap, computes
edge weights using negative log-transformed Jaccard scores, and performs join
path discovery via graph traversal. Experiments on synthetic healthcare-style
databases demonstrate the system's ability to recover valid joins despite
fuzzified column names and partial value mismatches. This research has direct
applications in data integration.

Motivation: 现有FANNS算法缺乏系统性研究，存在参数耦合、数据集依赖性强、关键影响因素分析不足等问题，导致算法比较不可靠，需要建立统一的评估基准。

Method: 提出算法分类法(过滤后搜索、搜索后过滤、混合搜索)，设计系统性评估框架，包含统一参数调优和标准化过滤，通过综合实证研究分析查询难度和数据集特性对性能的影响。

Result: 建立了标准化的基准测试框架，提供了真实世界数据集和开源资源，明确了不同算法在不同场景下的优势和适用条件。

Conclusion: 该研究为FANNS领域提供了公平的评估方法和统一的基准，有助于理解算法性能差异，促进未来研究的可重复性。

Abstract: For a given dataset $\mathcal{D}$ and structured label $f$, the goal of
Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS) algorithms is to find
top-$k$ points closest to a query that satisfy label constraints, while
ensuring both recall and QPS (Queries Per Second). In recent years, many FANNS
algorithms have been proposed. However, the lack of a systematic investigation
makes it difficult to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses.
Additionally, we found that: (1) FANNS algorithms have coupled,
dataset-dependent parameters, leading to biased comparisons. (2) Key impact
factors are rarely analyzed systematically, leaving unclear when each algorithm
performs well. (3) Disparate datasets, workloads, and biased experiment designs
make cross-algorithm comparisons unreliable. Thus, a comprehensive survey and
benchmark for FANNS is crucial to achieve the following goals: designing a fair
evaluation and clarifying the classification of algorithms, conducting in-depth
analysis of their performance, and establishing a unified benchmark. First, we
propose a taxonomy (dividing methods into \textit{filter-then-search},
\textit{search-then-filter}, \textit{hybrid-search}) and a systematic
evaluation framework, integrating unified parameter tuning and standardized
filtering across algorithms to reduce implementation-induced performance
variations and reflect core trade-offs. Then, we conduct a comprehensive
empirical study to analyze how query difficulty and dataset properties impact
performance, evaluating robustness under pressures like filter selectivity,
Recall@k, and scalability to clarify each method's strengths. Finally, we
establish a standardized benchmark with real-world datasets and open-source
related resources to ensure reproducible future research.

Motivation: 解决云环境中动态数据密集型工作负载带来的挑战，特别是复制负载大小跨度大、带宽压力偶发的问题

Method: 采用每实例擦除编码，智能分发编码分片，支持自适应分片分配和仲裁大小权衡，使用延迟跟随者八卦机制处理领导者故障转移

Conclusion: Crossword协议在保持经典协议可用性保证的同时，有效应对动态数据密集型工作负载，显著提升性能，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: We present Crossword, a flexible consensus protocol for dynamic data-heavy
workloads, a rising challenge in the cloud where replication payload sizes span
a wide spectrum and introduce sporadic bandwidth stress. Crossword applies
per-instance erasure coding and distributes coded shards intelligently to
reduce critical-path data transfer significantly when desirable. Unlike
previous approaches that statically assign shards to servers, Crossword enables
an adaptive tradeoff between the assignment of shards and quorum size in
reaction to dynamic workloads and network conditions, while always retaining
the availability guarantee of classic protocols. Crossword handles leader
failover gracefully by employing a lazy follower gossiping mechanism that
incurs minimal impact on critical-path performance. We implement Crossword
(along with relevant protocols) in Gazette, a distributed, replicated, and
protocol-generic key-value store written in async Rust. We evaluate Crossword
comprehensively to show that it matches the best performance among previous
protocols (MultiPaxos, Raft, RSPaxos, and CRaft) in static scenarios, and
outperforms them by up to 2.3x under dynamic workloads and network conditions.
Our integration of Crossword with CockroachDB brings 1.32x higher aggregate
throughput to TPC-C under 5-way replication. We will open-source Gazette upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共识协议无法在不干扰写入的情况下从任意节点提供本地线性化读取，需要一种新的协议设计来解决这一限制。

Method: 提出roster leases算法，通过roster（集群元数据的新概念）跟踪副本子集作为本地读取的响应节点，采用乐观保持和早期接受通知等技术。

Result: 在真实WAN集群测试中，Bodega相比现有方法将平均客户端读取请求速度提升5.6-13.1倍，写入性能相当，支持快速主动roster变更和容错。

Conclusion: Bodega通过roster leases机制实现了无干扰写入的本地线性化读取，为共识协议设计开辟了新的可能性，性能显著优于现有方案。

Abstract: We present Bodega, the first consensus protocol that serves linearizable
reads locally from any desired node, regardless of interfering writes. Bodega
achieves this via a novel roster leases algorithm that safeguards the roster, a
new notion of cluster metadata. The roster is a generalization of leadership;
it tracks arbitrary subsets of replicas as responder nodes for local reads. A
consistent agreement on the roster is established through roster leases, an
all-to-all leasing mechanism that generalizes existing all-to-one leasing
approaches (Leader Leases, Quorum Leases), unlocking a new point in the
protocol design space. Bodega further employs optimistic holding and early
accept notifications to minimize interruption from interfering writes, and
incorporates smart roster coverage and lightweight heartbeats to maximize
practicality. Bodega is a non-intrusive extension to classic consensus; it
imposes no special requirements on writes other than a responder-covering
quorum. We implement Bodega and related works in Vineyard, a protocol-generic
replicated key-value store written in async Rust. We compare it to previous
protocols (Leader Leases, EPaxos, PQR, and Quorum Leases) and two production
coordination services (etcd and ZooKeeper). Bodega speeds up average client
read requests by 5.6x-13.1x on real WAN clusters versus previous approaches
under moderate write interference, delivers comparable write performance,
supports fast proactive roster changes as well as fault tolerance via leases,
and closely matches the performance of sequentially-consistent etcd and
ZooKeeper deployments across all YCSB workloads. We will open-source Vineyard
upon publication.

Abstract: Memory-to-memory data streaming is essential for modern scientific workflows
that require near real-time data analysis, experimental steering, and informed
decision-making during experiment execution. It eliminates the latency
bottlenecks associated with file-based transfers to parallel storage, enabling
rapid data movement between experimental facilities and HPC systems. These
tightly coupled experimental-HPC workflows demand low latency, high throughput,
and reliable data delivery to support on-the-fly analysis and timely feedback
for experimental control. Off-the-shelf messaging frameworks are increasingly
considered viable solutions for enabling such direct memory streaming due to
their maturity, broad adoption, and ability to abstract core messaging and
reliability functionalities from the application layer. However, effectively
meeting the workflows' requirements depends on utilizing the framework's
capabilities and carefully tuning its configurations.
  In this paper, we present a study that investigates the messaging parameters,
and their configuration choices that impact the streaming requirements of two
representative scientific workflows. We specifically characterize throughput
trade-offs associated with reliable message transmission for these workflows.
Our study is conducted through streaming simulations using synthetic workloads
derived from the Deleria and LCLS workflows, employing the RabbitMQ messaging
framework within the context of the Data Streaming to HPC infrastructure at
OLCF. Our simulations reveal several key observations and practical insights
that help users understand which configurations best meet the needs of their

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to the development of
numerous applications that require quick responses and low latency. Fog
computing has emerged as a solution for processing these IoT applications, but
it faces challenges such as resource allocation and job scheduling. Therefore,
it is crucial to determine how to assign and schedule tasks on Fog nodes. A
well-designed job scheduling algorithm can help decrease energy usage and
improve response times for application requests. This work aims to schedule
tasks in IoT while minimizing the total energy consumption of nodes and
enhancing the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of IoT tasks, taking into
account task deadlines. Initially, this paper classifies the Fog nodes into two
categories based on their traffic level: low and high. It schedules
low-deadline tasks on low-traffic-level nodes using an Improved Golden Eagle
Optimization (IGEO) algorithm, an enhancement of the Golden Eagle Optimization
Algorithm that utilizes genetic operators for discretization. High-deadline
tasks are processed on high-traffic nodes using reinforcement learning (RL).
This combined approach is called the Reinforcement Improved Golden Eagle
Optimization (RIGEO) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms optimize system response time, total deadline violation
time, and resource and system energy consumption compared to other
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: DuoServe-MoE是一个针对MoE模型推理的优化系统，通过分离prefill和decode阶段并采用定制化专家调度策略，显著降低GPU内存使用并提升推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型虽然通过稀疏激活专家分支保持推理效率，但大量专家权重带来了显著的GPU内存压力，特别是在单GPU服务器等资源受限环境中。MoE推理的两个阶段（prefill阶段密集激活、decode阶段稀疏激活）需要不同的调度策略

Method: 提出DuoServe-MoE系统：1）分离prefill和decode阶段；2）prefill阶段使用双流CUDA管道重叠专家权重预取和非MoE层计算；3）decode阶段使用离线训练的轻量级层级预测器预取最可能激活的专家

Result: 在4位Mixtral-8x7B和8x22B模型上，DuoServe-MoE将端到端延迟提升了1.42到7.54倍，同时将峰值内存使用保持在完整模型大小的仅15%

Conclusion: DuoServe-MoE通过阶段分离和定制化调度策略，有效解决了MoE模型推理中的内存压力和延迟问题，为资源受限环境下的高效MoE推理提供了可行方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
a wide range of deep learning tasks. Mixture of Experts (MoE) further enhances
their capabilities by increasing model width through sparsely activated expert
branches, which keeps inference computation efficient. However, the large
number of expert weights introduces significant GPU memory pressure, especially
in resource-constrained environments such as single-GPU servers. More
importantly, MoE inference consists of two fundamentally different stages: a
prefill stage where most experts are activated densely, and a decode stage
where only a few experts are triggered sparsely. Treating these stages with a
uniform scheduling strategy often leads to suboptimal latency and memory usage.
To address this, we propose DuoServe-MoE, an inference serving system that
explicitly separates prefill and decode stages and applies tailored expert
scheduling strategies to each. In the prefill stage, DuoServe-MoE uses a
two-stream CUDA pipeline that overlaps expert weight prefetching with the
computation of non-MoE layers, limiting expert residency in GPU memory. In the
decode stage, a lightweight layer-level predictor trained offline from
activation traces is used to prefetch only the most likely activated experts,
without requiring any changes to the model. Experiments on 4-bit Mixtral-8x7B
and 8x22B models show that DuoServe-MoE improves end-to-end latency by 1.42 to
7.54 times while keeping peak memory usage at only 15 percent of the full model
size.

TL;DR: 提出了Hyperledger Fabric的依赖感知执行模型，通过依赖标记、优化区块构建、DAG依赖表示和并行执行，显著提升了交易吞吐量并降低了拒绝率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperledger Fabric在企业级应用中面临高负载下交易吞吐量低和拒绝率高的问题，主要由于背书、排序和验证瓶颈，以及乐观并发控制和延迟验证导致的资源低效和竞争

Method: 1) 背书阶段的依赖标记系统；2) 排序服务中优化区块构建优先处理独立交易；3) 在区块内使用DAG表示依赖关系；4) 提交节点并行执行独立交易并按DAG顺序处理依赖交易

Result: 在Hyperledger Fabric v2.5中测试显示，高竞争场景下吞吐量提升高达40%，拒绝率显著降低

Conclusion: 依赖感知调度和基于DAG的执行能显著增强Fabric的可扩展性，同时保持与现有共识和智能合约层的兼容性

Abstract: Hyperledger Fabric is a leading permissioned blockchain framework for
enterprise use, known for its modular design and privacy features. While it
strongly supports configurable consensus and access control, Fabric can face
challenges in achieving high transaction throughput and low rejection rates
under heavy workloads. These performance limitations are often attributed to
endorsement, ordering, and validation bottlenecks. Further, optimistic
concurrency control and deferred validation in Fabric may lead to resource
inefficiencies and contention, as conflicting transactions are identified only
during the commit phase. To address these challenges, we propose a
dependency-aware execution model for Hyperledger Fabric. Our approach includes:
(a) a dependency flagging system during endorsement, marking transactions as
independent or dependent using a hashmap; (b) an optimized block construction
in the ordering service that prioritizes independent transactions; (c) the
incorporation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) within each block to represent
dependencies; and (d) parallel execution of independent transactions at the
committer, with dependent transactions processed according to DAG order.
Incorporated in Hyperledger Fabric v2.5, our framework was tested on workloads
with varying dependency levels and system loads. Results show up to 40% higher
throughput and significantly reduced rejection rates in high-contention
scenarios. This demonstrates that dependency-aware scheduling and DAG-based
execution can substantially enhance Fabric's scalability while remaining
compatible with its existing consensus and smart contract layers.

TL;DR: Astra是首个基于LLM的多智能体系统，专门用于GPU内核优化，通过从现有CUDA实现而非PyTorch模块出发，实现了平均1.32倍的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU内核优化对LLM训练和服务至关重要，但传统方法需要大量手动调优。现有编译器系统仍需要大量人工设计和工程努力，需要更自动化的解决方案。

Method: Astra采用多智能体LLM系统，从SGLang框架提取的现有CUDA实现开始，通过专门的LLM智能体协作进行迭代代码生成、测试、性能分析和规划。

Result: 在SGLang内核上，Astra使用OpenAI o4-mini零样本提示实现了平均1.32倍的加速。案例研究表明LLM能够自主应用循环变换、优化内存访问模式、利用CUDA内置函数和快速数学运算。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM系统是GPU内核优化的有前景的新范式，能够自动实现显著的性能提升。

Abstract: GPU kernel optimization has long been a central challenge at the intersection
of high-performance computing and machine learning. Efficient kernels are
crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet
attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning.
Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial
manual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using
LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on
translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we
introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel
optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA
implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving
LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra,
specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing,
profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and
high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of
1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study
further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations,
optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast
math operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights
multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel
optimization.

TL;DR: DREAMS是一个去中心化的微服务部署框架，通过Raft共识算法和成本效益投票实现跨计算域的协作优化，特别适用于现代制造业的动态计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造系统需要能够响应高度动态工作负载和定制化生产需求的自适应计算基础设施。传统集中式解决方案存在扩展性差、延迟瓶颈和单点故障等问题，无法有效满足计算连续体的需求。

Method: 提出DREAMS去中心化框架，在每个计算域内部署自主运行的代理，通过Raft共识算法和成本效益投票进行全局协调，实现隐私保护和容错的协作优化。

Result: DREAMS在现代制造环境中实现了全局优化的服务部署，同时保持高容错性。关键协调操作（如LDM注册和迁移投票）随域数量呈亚线性扩展，证明了框架的高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: DREAMS框架为计算连续体提供了一种有效的去中心化微服务部署解决方案，特别适合多利益相关方场景，能够满足现代制造业对响应性、隐私保护和容错性的要求。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing systems require adaptive computing infrastructures that
can respond to highly dynamic workloads and increasingly customized production
demands. The compute continuum emerges as a promising solution, enabling
flexible deployment of microservices across distributed, heterogeneous domains.
However, this paradigm also requires a novel approach to resource allocation
and service placement, as traditional centralized solutions struggle to scale
effectively, suffer from latency bottlenecks, and introduce single points of
failure. In this paper, we present DREAMS, a decentralized framework that
optimizes microservice placement decisions collaboratively across different
computational domains. At its core, DREAMS introduces agents that operate
autonomously within each domain while coordinating globally through a
Raft-based consensus algorithm and cost-benefit voting. This decentralized
architecture enables responsive, privacy-preserving, and fault-tolerant
coordination, making it particularly suitable given the growing prevalence of
multi-stakeholder scenarios across the compute continuum. In particular, within
modern manufacturing environments, DREAMS achieves globally optimized service
placements while maintaining high fault tolerance. Further evaluations
demonstrate that key coordination operations, such as Local Domain Manager
(LDM) registration and migration voting, scale sub-linearly with the number of
domains, confirming the efficiency and scalability of our proposal.

Motivation: 绿色能源的间歇性和电力市场波动使HPC系统能源预算复杂化，需要动态调整计算资源以降低能源成本

Method: 建立一个简单模型，使用关键系统参数帮助操作者估算可变容量策略对TCO的影响，并将模型应用于大学HPC集群的实际数据

Result: 通过模型分析不同情景下可变容量策略对未来成本效益的影响

Conclusion: 可变容量策略是管理HPC能源成本的有效方法，但需要在节能和硬件利用率之间找到平衡

Abstract: Energy costs are a major factor in the total cost of ownership (TCO) for
high-performance computing (HPC) systems. The rise of intermittent green energy
sources and reduced reliance on fossil fuels have introduced volatility into
electricity markets, complicating energy budgeting. This paper explores
variable capacity as a strategy for managing HPC energy costs - dynamically
adjusting compute resources in response to fluctuating electricity prices.
While this approach can lower energy expenses, it risks underutilizing costly
hardware. To evaluate this trade-off, we present a simple model that helps
operators estimate the TCO impact of variable capacity strategies using key
system parameters. We apply this model to real data from a university HPC
cluster and assess how different scenarios could affect the cost-effectiveness
of this approach in the future.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智能体系统在处理多工具、复杂多步骤任务和长上下文管理时存在困难，需要更有效的工作流模式来提升决策能力和避免幻觉。

Method: 提出AgentX工作流模式，包含阶段设计器、规划器和执行器三个代理组件，并利用MCP工具，提出了两种基于FaaS的MCP服务器部署方法。

Result: 通过三个实际应用的实证评估，AgentX在成功率、延迟和成本方面都优于或与最先进的ReAct和Magentic One模式相当。

Conclusion: AgentX为智能体工作流设计提供了新的有效模式，同时FaaS部署方案展示了云端部署的机遇和挑战。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has rapidly transformed various
fields including code generation, text summarization, image generation and so
on. Agentic AI is a recent evolution that further advances this by coupling the
decision making and generative capabilities of LLMs with actions that can be
performed using tools. While seemingly powerful, Agentic systems often struggle
when faced with numerous tools, complex multi-step tasks,and long-context
management to track history and avoid hallucinations. Workflow patterns such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReAct help address this. Here, we define a novel
agentic workflow pattern, AgentX, composed of stage designer, planner, and
executor agents that is competitive or better than the state-of-the-art agentic
patterns. We also leverage Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, and propose two
alternative approaches for deploying MCP servers as cloud Functions as a
Service (FaaS). We empirically evaluate the success rate, latency and cost for
AgentX and two contemporary agentic patterns, ReAct and Magentic One, using
these the FaaS and local MCP server alternatives for three practical
applications. This highlights the opportunities and challenges of designing and
deploying agentic workflows.

Motivation: 原子多播是可靠系统中的关键通信原语，但现有协议主要针对消息传递系统，共享内存系统的协议较少，需要高性能的解决方案

Method: 利用覆盖树架构设计TRAM原子多播协议，专门针对共享内存系统进行优化

Result: 相比最先进的共享内存协议，吞吐量提升3倍以上，延迟降低2.3倍以上；相比消息传递协议，吞吐量提升5.9倍，延迟降低106倍

Conclusion: TRAM协议通过简单实用的设计，在共享内存系统中实现了卓越的性能表现，为集成复制和分片提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Atomic multicast is a communication primitive used in dependable systems to
ensure consistent ordering of messages delivered to a set of replica groups.
This primitive enables critical services to integrate replication and sharding
(i.e., state partitioning) to achieve fault tolerance and scalability. While
several atomic multicast protocols have been developed for message-passing
systems, only a few are designed for the shared memory system model. This paper
introduces TRAM, an atomic multicast protocol specifically designed for shared
memory systems, leveraging an overlay tree architecture. Due to its simple and
practical design, TRAM delivers exceptional performance, increasing throughput
by more than 3$\times$ and reducing latency by more than 2.3$\times$ compared
to state-of-the-art shared memory-based protocols. Additionally, it
significantly outperforms message-passing-based protocols, boosting throughput
by up to 5.9$\times$ and reducing latency by up to 106$\times$.

Motivation: 随着LLM在交互式应用中的广泛使用，其推理能耗成本急剧上升，对可持续和成本效益部署构成了重大挑战。

Method: VoltanaLLM采用控制理论方法，包含反馈驱动的频率控制器（动态调整prefill和decode阶段的GPU频率）和状态空间路由器（探索跨频率缩放实例的路由决策），在解耦的prefill/decode架构中实现细粒度的阶段特定控制。

Conclusion: VoltanaLLM为可持续和智能的LLM服务铺平了道路，通过创新的控制理论方法有效解决了LLM推理的高能耗问题。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems increasingly support
interactive applications, like real-time chat assistants, code generation
tools, and agentic workflows. However, the soaring energy cost of LLM inference
presents a growing challenge for sustainable and cost-effective deployment.
This paper introduces VoltanaLLM, a system for SLO-aware, energy-efficient LLM
serving, built from a control theory perspective. VoltanaLLM co-designs
frequency scaling and request routing in emerging prefill/decode disaggregated
architectures, leveraging their decoupled execution to enable fine-grained
phase-specific control. It consists of a feedback-driven frequency controller
that dynamically adapts GPU frequency for prefill and decode phases, and a
state-space router that explores routing decisions across frequency-scaled
instances to minimize energy under latency constraints. We implement VoltanaLLM
in SGLang and evaluate its performance over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and
real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that VoltanaLLM achieves up to
36.3% energy savings while maintaining near-perfect SLO attainment rate, paving
the way for sustainable and intelligent LLM serving.

Motivation: 多路径传输网络虽有更好性能和弹性，但缺乏实际环境中的实证数据，影响有效协议设计

Method: 在全球SCIONLab测试平台上进行长期徒继性测量研究，分析路径稳定性、多样性和性能特征

Result: 发现测试平台存在显著的控制平面变动和短路径寿命，路由策略导致了路径可用性不对称现象，同时多路径传输在提升总速率的同时可能降低单个路径的延迟和可靠性

Conclusion: 多路径协议（如MPQUIC）应明确考虑高更新率和路径不对称性，这对常规多路径协议设计假设构成挑战

Abstract: Path-aware networks promise enhanced performance and resilience through
multipath transport, but a lack of empirical data on their real-world dynamics
hinders the design of effective protocols. This paper presents a longitudinal
measurement study of the SCION architecture on the global SCIONLab testbed,
characterizing the path stability, diversity, and performance crucial for
protocols like Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC). Our measurements reveal a dynamic
environment, with significant control-plane churn and short path lifetimes in
parts of the testbed. We identify and characterize path discrepancy, a
phenomenon where routing policies create asymmetric path availability between
endpoints. Furthermore, we observe a performance trade-off where concurrent
multipath transmissions can improve aggregate throughput but may degrade the
latency and reliability of individual paths. These findings demonstrate that
protocols such as MPQUIC should explicitly account for high churn and path
asymmetry, challenging common assumptions in multipath protocol design.

TL;DR: DORA是一个基于深度强化学习的动态资源分配框架，用于5G O-RAN网络中切片级别的PRB分配，支持在线训练并优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络需要同时支持URLLC、eMBB和mMTC等不同服务类别，每种服务都有不同的QoS要求。在有限的频谱资源下满足这些需求需要自适应的、符合标准的无线资源管理

Method: 采用基于PPO的强化学习代理，根据观测到的流量需求和信道条件在URLLC、eMBB和mMTC切片之间分配PRB。切片内PRB调度通过轮询方式在活跃UE之间确定性处理

Result: 在拥塞情况下，DORA优于三种非学习基准方法和DQN代理，实现了更低的URLLC延迟、更高的eMBB吞吐量（SLA违规更少）以及更广泛的mMTC覆盖，且不会饿死高优先级切片

Conclusion: DORA是首个完全在线的DRL框架，用于O-RAN中自适应的切片感知PRB分配，可无缝集成到RAN智能控制器中

Abstract: The fifth generation (5G) of wireless networks must simultaneously support
heterogeneous service categories, including Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency
Communications (URLLC), enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and massive
Machine-Type Communications (mMTC), each with distinct Quality of Service (QoS)
requirements. Meeting these demands under limited spectrum resources requires
adaptive and standards-compliant radio resource management. We present DORA
(Dynamic O-RAN Resource Allocation), a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
framework for dynamic slice-level Physical Resource Block (PRB) allocation in
Open RAN. DORA employs a PPO-based RL agent to allocate PRBs across URLLC,
eMBB, and mMTC slices based on observed traffic demands and channel conditions.
Intra-slice PRB scheduling is handled deterministically via round-robin among
active UEs, simplifying control complexity and improving training stability.
Unlike prior work, DORA supports online training and adapts continuously to
evolving traffic patterns and cross-slice contention. Implemented in the
standards-compliant OpenAirInterface (OAI) RAN stack and designed for
deployment as an O-RAN xApp, DORA integrates seamlessly with RAN Intelligent
Controllers (RICs). Extensive evaluation under congested regimes shows that
DORA outperforms three non-learning baselines and a \texttt{DQN} agent,
achieving lower URLLC latency, higher eMBB throughput with fewer SLA
violations, and broader mMTC coverage without starving high-priority slices. To
our knowledge, this is the first fully online DRL framework for adaptive,
slice-aware PRB allocation in O-RAN.

Motivation: 5G/6G移动核心网正在向基于服务的架构(SBA)重构，但现有性能优化策略仍采用传统的NFV技术，导致灵活性和可扩展性之间存在权衡问题。

Method: 提出了弹性SBA微服务设计模式和状态管理策略，开发了TEGRA系统，利用移动核心在边缘网络中的独特位置进行性能优化。

Result: TEGRA处理请求速度比free5GC快20倍，比Open5GS快11倍，比Aether快1.75倍，同时与最先进的CoreKube性能相当，且部署新功能所需的代码行数大幅减少。

Conclusion: TEGRA证明了在SBA移动核心中可以实现高性能和灵活性的双赢，无需在两者之间做出妥协，为下一代移动网络架构提供了新的设计思路。

Abstract: To support emerging mobile use cases (e.g., AR/VR, autonomous driving, and
massive IoT), next-generation mobile cores for 5G and 6G are being
re-architected as service-based architectures (SBAs) running on both private
and public clouds. However, current performance optimization strategies for
scaling these cores still revert to traditional NFV-based techniques, such as
consolidating functions into rigid, monolithic deployments on dedicated
servers. This raises a critical question: Is there an inherent tradeoff between
flexibility and scalability in an SBA-based mobile core, where improving
performance (and resiliency) inevitably comes at the cost of one or the other?
  To explore this question, we introduce resilient SBA microservices design
patterns and state-management strategies, and propose TEGRA -- a
high-performance, flexible, and scalable SBA-based mobile core. By leveraging
the mobile core's unique position in the end-to-end internet ecosystem (i.e.,
at the last-mile edge), TEGRA optimizes performance without compromising
adaptability. Our evaluation demonstrates that TEGRA achieves significantly
lower latencies, processing requests 20x, 11x, and 1.75x faster than
traditional SBA core implementations -- free5GC, Open5GS, and Aether,
respectively -- all while matching the performance of state-of-the-art cores
(e.g., CoreKube) while retaining flexibility. Furthermore, it reduces the
complexity of deploying new features, requiring orders of magnitude fewer lines
of code (LoCs) compared to existing cores.

TL;DR: NAAM是一个网络加速主动消息系统，使用eBPF函数实现消息处理逻辑的便携式执行，可在客户端、服务器和智能网卡之间动态调度，显著提升性能并支持大量应用卸载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RDMA操作有限、编程复杂且需要多次往返的问题，以及智能网卡应用中逻辑部署位置选择的复杂性，提供统一的动态卸载方案。

Method: 采用eBPF函数关联消息，指定数据访问接口，运行时动态选择最佳执行位置（客户端、服务器CPU或智能网卡）。

Result: 在NVIDIA BlueField-2智能网卡上实现：动态卸载180万次MICA操作/秒和75万次Cell查找/秒，支持数百个应用卸载且尾部延迟影响小。

Conclusion: NAAM通过eBPF的便携性和动态调度能力，有效解决了网络加速中的卸载位置选择问题，显著提升了系统性能和扩展性。

Abstract: Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) improves host networking performance by
eliminating software and server CPU involvement. However, RDMA has a limited
set of operations, is difficult to program, and often requires multiple round
trips to perform simple application operations. Programmable SmartNICs provide
a different means to offload work from host CPUs to a NIC. This leaves
applications with the complex choice of embedding logic as RPC handlers at
servers, using RDMA's limited interface to access server structures via
client-side logic, or running some logic on SmartNICs. The best choice varies
between workloads and over time. To solve this dilemma, we present NAAM,
network-accelerated active messages. NAAM applications specify small, portable
eBPF functions associated with messages. Each message specifies what data it
accesses using an RDMA-like interface. NAAM runs at various places in the
network, including at clients, on server-attached SmartNICs, and server host
CPU cores. Due to eBPF's portability, the code associated with a message can be
run at any location. Hence, the NAAM runtime can dynamically steer any message
to execute its associated logic wherever it makes the most sense. To
demonstrate NAAM's flexibility, we built several applications, including the
MICA hash table and lookups from a Cell-style B-tree. With an NVIDIA
BlueField-2 SmartNIC and integrating its NIC-embedded switch, NAAM can run any
of these operations on client, server, and NIC cores, shifting load in tens of
milliseconds on server compute congestion. NAAM dynamically offloads up to 1.8
million MICA ops/s for YCSB-B and 750,000 Cell lookups/s from server CPUs.
Finally, whereas iPipe, the state-of-the-art SmartNIC offload framework, only
scales to 8 application offloads on BlueField-2, NAAM scales to hundreds of
application offloads with minimal impact on tail latency due to eBPF's low
overhead.

Method: 提出基于LLM的优化框架，采用自然语言输入编码策略来限制解空间并保证可行性。针对多接入边缘计算网络，优化任务分配同时最小化最坏情况延迟。

Result: 数值评估表明LLM在约束感知网络优化中表现出色，展示了其推理能力，为严格约束满足提供了可行解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM成为约束感知网络优化的有前景工具，该框架成功解决了约束满足问题，为网络优化提供了新的思路和方法。

Abstract: This work develops an LLM-based optimization framework ensuring strict
constraint satisfaction in network optimization. While LLMs possess contextual
reasoning capabilities, existing approaches often fail to enforce constraints,
causing infeasible solutions. Unlike conventional methods that address average
constraints, the proposed framework integrates a natural language-based input
encoding strategy to restrict the solution space and guarantee feasibility. For
multi-access edge computing networks, task allocation is optimized while
minimizing worst-case latency. Numerical evaluations demonstrate LLMs as a
promising tool for constraint-aware network optimization, offering insights
into their inference capabilities.

TL;DR: 基于实时用户需求动态选择最优跨座载荷配置的灵活卫星接入网络架构FlexSAN，在保证QoS的前提下提高用户接入率和降低运营成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有卫星接入网络的跨座载荷配置是静态的（要么全gNB要么只uDU），导致资源浪费或用户体验差，需要根据实时需求动态选择最优配置

Method: 设计FlexSAN架构，在所有用户需求满足时选择最低OPEX的跨座载荷配置，否则在保证QoS的前提下最大化接纳用户数量，并使用适应性贪心算法解决计算复杂性问题

Result: 实验结果显示FlexSAN与静态SAN相比，用户接纳率平均提高36.1%，OPEX降低15%

Conclusion: FlexSAN通过动态选择最优跨座载荷配置，能够在保证QoS的同时显著提高网络性能和降低运营成本，为卫星接入网络提供了更灵活高效的解决方案

Abstract: The regenerative satellite access network (SAN) architecture deploys
next-generation NodeB (gNBs) on satellites to enable enhanced network
management capabilities. It supports two types of regenerative payload,
on-board gNB and on-board gNB-Distributed Unit (gNB-DU). Measurement results
based on our prototype implementation show that the on-board gNB offers lower
latency, while the on-board gNB-DU is more cost-effective, and there is often a
trade-off between Quality-of-Service (QoS) and operational expenditure (OPEX)
when choosing between the two payload types. However, current SAN
configurations are static and inflexible -- either deploying the full on-board
gNB or only the on-board gNB-DU. This rigidity can lead to resource waste or
poor user experiences. In this paper, we propose Flexible SAN (FlexSAN), an
adaptive satellite access network architecture that dynamically configures the
optimal regenerative payload based on real-time user demands. FlexSAN selects
the lowest OPEX payload configuration when all user demands are satisfied, and
otherwise maximizes the number of admitted users while ensuring QoS for
connected users. To address the computational complexity of dynamic payload
selection, we design an adaptive greedy heuristic algorithm. Extensive
experiments validate FlexSAN's effectiveness, showing a 36.1% average
improvement in user admission rates and a 15% OPEX reduction over static SANs.

a methodology for optimization using quantum annealing as well as quantum
reinforcement learning. Additionally, we discuss the main challenges that QC
algorithms and hardware must overcome to effectively optimize future networks.

TL;DR: MSwift通过使用中位数反馈机制改进Google Swift算法，使其在每包负载均衡的多路径网络中保持性能，避免吞吐量崩溃，提升99%尾部完成时间达25%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有每包负载均衡技术与拥塞控制算法结合时会导致性能下降甚至崩溃，单纯处理重复ACK不足够解决多路径路由带来的问题。

Method: 提出使用中位数反馈机制替代传统最新反馈，设计MSwift算法对Google Swift进行改进，使其能处理多路径路由的变异性信号。

Result: MSwift在随机包喷洒和自适应路由场景下，将99%尾部完成时间(FCT)提升高达25%，同时保持单路径性能和拥塞容忍能力。

Conclusion: 中位数反馈是解决多路径路由中拥塞控制算法性能问题的有效方法，MSwift成功实现了在多路径环境中保持高性能的目标。

Abstract: Per-packet load-balancing approaches are increasingly deployed in datacenter
networks. However, their combination with existing congestion control
algorithms (CCAs) may lead to poor performance, and even state-of-the-art CCAs
can collapse due to duplicate ACKs. A typical approach to handle this collapse
is to make CCAs resilient to duplicate ACKs.
  In this paper, we first model the throughput collapse of a wide array of CCAs
when some of the paths are congested. We show that addressing duplicate ACKs is
insufficient. Instead, we explain that since CCAs are typically designed for
single-path routing, their estimation function focuses on the latest feedback
and mishandles feedback that reflects multiple paths. We propose to use a
median feedback that is more robust to the varying signals that come with
multiple paths. We introduce MSwift, which applies this principle to make
Google's Swift robust to multi-path routing while keeping its incast tolerance
and single-path performance. Finally, we demonstrate that MSwift improves the
99th-percentile FCT by up to 25\%, both with random packet spraying and
adaptive routing.

TL;DR: veScale是一个基于SPMD范式的分布式训练系统，通过创新的分布式随机数生成算法和性能优化，在保持单设备结果一致性的同时，实现了2.2倍的速度提升和78.4%的代码复杂度降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模和复杂度的快速增长，现有的3D并行等分布式训练方法变得过于复杂且难以调试，需要转向更简单、可调试性更强的SPMD编程范式。

Method: veScale采用SPMD范式，引入创新的分布式随机数生成算法（兼容任意分片算子），通过减少PyTorch原语开销和提升通信效率来优化性能。

Result: 评估显示veScale相比最先进的训练系统（如TorchTitan）实现了最高2.2倍的速度提升，代码复杂度降低78.4%，同时保持与单设备执行结果的一致性。

Conclusion: veScale成功证明了SPMD范式在分布式训练中的可行性，通过简化编程模型同时提升性能和保持结果一致性，为分布式张量编程的民主化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have scaled rapidly in size and complexity,
requiring increasingly intricate parallelism for distributed training, such as
3D parallelism. This sophistication motivates a shift toward simpler, more
debuggable programming paradigm like Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD).
However, SPMD in eager execution introduces two key challenges: ensuring
consistency with single-device execution and achieving high performance at
scale. In this paper, we introduce veScale, an eager-mode training system that
fully embraces SPMD paradigm to democratize distributed tensor programming.
veScale addresses the prevalent issue of inconsistent results in systems like
PyTorch by introducing a novel algorithm of distributed Random Number
Generation (RNG) compatible with arbitrary sharded operators. veScale also
significantly boosts training performance by reducing PyTorch primitive's
overhead and improving communication efficiency. Evaluations show that veScale
delivers up to 2.2x speedup over the state-of-the-art training systems, like
TorchTitan, and cuts code complexity by 78.4%, while preserving
single-device-equivalent results.

Motivation: 宏嵌入技术虽然支持扩展性语言嵌入，但编译时性能成为瓶颈

Method: 使用micros技术（语法到IR转换），通过设计模式使IR和相关函数可扩展

Result: 实现了可扩展的混合嵌入方案，编译时间显著提升

Conclusion: 小型嵌入技术为统计类型语言提供了更高性能的编译时处理方案

Abstract: Macro embedding is a popular approach to defining extensible shallow
embeddings of object languages in Scheme like host languages. While macro
embedding has even been shown to enable implementing extensible typed languages
in systems like Racket, it comes at a cost: compile-time performance. In this
paper, we revisit micros - syntax to intermediate representation (IR)
transformers, rather than source syntax to source syntax transformers (macros).
Micro embedding enables stopping at an IR, producing a deep embedding and
enabling high performance compile-time functions over an efficient IR, before
shallowly embedding the IR back into source syntax. Combining micros with
several design patterns to enable the IR and functions over it to be
extensible, we achieve extensible hybrid embedding of statically typed
languages with significantly improved compile-time compared to macro-embedding
approaches. We describe our design patterns and propose new abstractions
packaging these patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Scala捕获类型系统无法有效跟踪嵌入在泛型数据结构中的能力，这阻碍了其在标准集合库中的应用，限制了该技术的广泛采用。

Method: 开发System Capless计算系统，引入reach capabilities机制，通过存在性和通用性捕获集量化来命名"盒子里的内容"，并在Lean中形式化验证了类型安全性和作用域安全性。

Result: 基于System Capless重新实现了Scala 3的捕获检查，成功迁移了整个Scala集合库和异步编程库，证明在绝大多数情况下可以实现最小化修改和接近零的语法开销。

Conclusion: reach capabilities机制使得捕获检查能够在生产代码中得到实际应用，解决了之前表达能力不足的问题，为轻量级效果多态性提供了可行的理论基础和实践方案。

Abstract: Capturing types in Scala unify static effect and resource tracking with
object capabilities, enabling lightweight effect polymorphism with minimal
notational overhead. However, their expressiveness has been insufficient for
tracking capabilities embedded in generic data structures, preventing them from
scaling to the standard collections library -- an essential prerequisite for
broader adoption. This limitation stems from the inability to name capabilities
within the system's notion of box types.
  This paper develops System Capless, a new foundation for capturing types that
provides the theoretical basis for reach capabilities (rcaps), a novel
mechanism for naming "what's in the box." The calculus refines the universal
capability notion into a new scheme with existential and universal capture set
quantification. Intuitively, rcaps witness existentially quantified capture
sets inside the boxes of generic types in a way that does not require exposing
existential capture types in the surface language. We have fully mechanized the
formal metatheory of System Capless in Lean, including proofs of type soundness
and scope safety. System Capless supports the same lightweight notation of
capturing types plus rcaps, as certified by a type-preserving translation, and
also enables fully optional explicit capture-set quantification to increase
expressiveness.
  Finally, we present a full reimplementation of capture checking in Scala 3
based on System Capless and migrate the entire Scala collections library and an
asynchronous programming library to evaluate its practicality and ergonomics.
Our results demonstrate that reach capabilities enable the adoption of capture
checking in production code with minimal changes and minimal-to-zero notational
overhead in a vast majority of cases.

Motivation: 理解开发者重构代码的原因以及哪些指标能捕捉这些动机，可以支持更广泛和有效地在实际中使用重构技术。

Method: 进行大规模实证研究，利用大型语言模型(LLMs)从版本控制数据中识别重构动机，并将发现与文献中先前报告的动机进行比较。

Result: LLMs在80%情况下与人工判断匹配，但仅47%与文献动机一致。LLMs为22%的动机提供了更详细的理由，主要强调可读性、清晰度和结构改进。大多数动机是实用性的，关注简化和可维护性。

Conclusion: LLMs能有效捕捉表面层动机但在架构推理方面存在困难。其价值在于提供局部化解释，与软件指标结合可形成混合方法，为更系统地优先处理重构和平衡短期改进与长期架构目标提供有前景的路径。

Abstract: Context. Code refactoring improves software quality without changing external
behavior. Despite its advantages, its benefits are hindered by the considerable
cost of time, resources, and continuous effort it demands. Aim. Understanding
why developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may
support wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We
performed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring
activity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying
motivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous
motivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in
80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%. They
enriched 22% of motivations with more detailed rationale, often highlighting
readability, clarity, and structural improvements. Most motivations were
pragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related
to developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation
with motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs
effectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural
reasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when
combined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches. Such integration
offers a promising path toward prioritizing refactoring more systematically and
balancing short-term improvements with long-term architectural goals.

Motivation: 传统面向对象编程将安全逻辑与业务功能混在一起，导致代码缀缘化、散布和可维护性下降

Method: 采用案例研究方法，比较AOP基于实现的认证、授权、输入验证等安全功能与传统OOP方案，分析代码质量、性能和可维护性指标

Result: AOP提高了安全机制的模块化、可重用性和可维护性，仅导致最小的性能开销

Conclusion: AOP为软件工程师和研究人员提供了在网络应用开发中平衡安全性与软件质量的实践见解

Abstract: Security remains a critical challenge in modern web applications, where
threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and injection attacks
continue to undermine trust and reliability. Traditional Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality,
leading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study
investigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure
software development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a
case study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features
including authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging,
and session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches.
Data collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code,
coupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics
(response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators.
Developer feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging
experiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality
model, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings
demonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of
security mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead. The
study contributes practical insights for software engineers and researchers
seeking to balance security with software quality in web application
development.

Motivation: 工业4.0中IT与OT的融合暴露了传统分层架构（如ISA-95和RAMI 4.0）的局限性，包括刚性结构、数据孤岛以及缺乏对云原生技术的支持，这些限制了可扩展和互操作工业系统的发展。

Method: 提出CRACI架构，采用解耦和事件驱动模型，嵌入信任、治理与策略、可观测性和生命周期管理等横切关注点作为基础支柱。通过理论对比分析和基于实际智能制造实施性能数据的定量评估进行验证。

Result: CRACI提供了一个可行的、最先进的架构，利用计算连续体克服传统模型的结构限制，实现可扩展的现代工业系统。

Conclusion: CRACI架构成功解决了传统工业架构的局限性，为工业4.0提供了云原生、可扩展的解决方案，通过理论分析和实际数据验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology
(OT) in Industry 4.0 exposes the limitations of traditional, hierarchical
architectures like ISA-95 and RAMI 4.0. Their inherent rigidity, data silos,
and lack of support for cloud-native technologies impair the development of
scalable and interoperable industrial systems. This paper addresses this issue
by introducing CRACI, a Cloud-native Reference Architecture for the Industrial
Compute Continuum. Among other features, CRACI promotes a decoupled and
event-driven model to enable flexible, non-hierarchical data flows across the
continuum. It embeds cross-cutting concerns as foundational pillars: Trust,
Governance & Policy, Observability, and Lifecycle Management, ensuring quality
attributes are core to the design. The proposed architecture is validated
through a two-fold approach: (1) a comparative theoretical analysis against
established standards, operational models, and academic proposals; and (2) a
quantitative evaluation based on performance data from previously published
real-world smart manufacturing implementations. The results demonstrate that
CRACI provides a viable, state-of-the-art architecture that utilizes the
compute continuum to overcome the structural limitations of legacy models and
enable scalable, modern industrial systems.

TL;DR: PatchSeeker是一个基于大语言模型的新方法，通过生成语义嵌入和增强提交消息，有效连接漏洞描述与修复提交，在基准测试中性能显著优于现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国家漏洞数据库(NVD)缺乏明确的漏洞修复提交(VFCs)链接，现有方法依赖稀疏且嘈杂的提交消息，无法捕捉漏洞描述的深层语义，需要更有效的自动映射方法。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成NVD描述的嵌入表示，并为简短或无信息的提交消息合成详细摘要，构建漏洞描述与代码变更之间的语义桥梁。

Result: 在基准数据集上比最佳基线方法Prospector的MRR提高59.3%，Recall@10提高27.9%，在最新CVE上的扩展评估进一步证实了有效性。

Conclusion: 提交消息生成方法和骨干LLM的选择都对PatchSeeker有积极贡献，该方法能有效解决漏洞描述与修复提交之间的映射问题，但仍存在局限性和开放挑战。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose serious risks to modern software ecosystems.
While the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the authoritative source for
cataloging these vulnerabilities, it often lacks explicit links to the
corresponding Vulnerability-Fixing Commits (VFCs). VFCs encode precise code
changes, enabling vulnerability localization, patch analysis, and dataset
construction. Automatically mapping NVD records to their true VFCs is therefore
critical. Existing approaches have limitations as they rely on sparse, often
noisy commit messages and fail to capture the deep semantics in the
vulnerability descriptions. To address this gap, we introduce PatchSeeker, a
novel method that leverages large language models to create rich semantic links
between vulnerability descriptions and their VFCs. PatchSeeker generates
embeddings from NVD descriptions and enhances commit messages by synthesizing
detailed summaries for those that are short or uninformative. These generated
messages act as a semantic bridge, effectively closing the information gap
between natural language reports and low-level code changes. Our approach
PatchSeeker achieves 59.3% higher MRR and 27.9% higher Recall@10 than the
best-performing baseline, Prospector, on the benchmark dataset. The extended
evaluation on recent CVEs further confirms PatchSeeker's effectiveness.
Ablation study shows that both the commit message generation method and the
selection of backbone LLMs make a positive contribution to PatchSeeker. We also
discuss limitations and open challenges to guide future work.

TL;DR: Spack包管理器通过splicing技术实现二进制兼容性建模，允许混合使用源码和预编译二进制包，解决了HPC环境中二进制包安装快速但配置受限、源码包灵活但编译慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二进制包管理器安装快速但ABI要求严格限制了配置灵活性，源码包管理器虽然灵活但编译缓慢。HPC环境中安装新MPI实现等场景需要完全重编译，效率低下。

Method: 提出splicing技术，扩展Spack的包语言和依赖解析引擎，建立二进制兼容性模型，允许重用兼容的二进制包同时保持源码构建的灵活性。

Result: 实现了源码和二进制分发的无缝混合，安装时间开销最小化，即使对MPI等ABI敏感的依赖也能快速从二进制安装，避免大量重编译。

Conclusion: splicing技术成功解决了HPC包管理中二进制与源码构建的权衡问题，在保持灵活性的同时显著提升了安装效率。

Abstract: Binary package managers install software quickly but they limit
configurability due to rigid ABI requirements that ensure compatibility between
binaries. Source package managers provide flexibility in building software, but
compilation can be slow. For example, installing an HPC code with a new MPI
implementation may result in a full rebuild. Spack, a widely deployed,
HPC-focused package manager, can use source and pre-compiled binaries, but
lacks a binary compatibility model, so it cannot mix binaries not built
together. We present splicing, an extension to Spack that models binary
compatibility between packages and allows seamless mixing of source and binary
distributions. Splicing augments Spack's packaging language and dependency
resolution engine to reuse compatible binaries but maintains the flexibility of
source builds. It incurs minimal installation-time overhead and allows rapid
installation from binaries, even for ABI-sensitive dependencies like MPI that
would otherwise require many rebuilds.

Motivation: 现有业务过程模拟方法主要支持战术性决策，而运营性决策需要基于当前进行中案例的短期预测，以分析临时中断的影响。

Method: 提出一种方法，从事件日志中推导出当前案例和资源状态，作为模拟的初始状态，然后进行短期模拟预测。解决了两个关键问题：模拟所需的初始信息和如何从日志中推导当前状态。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的运营性决策支持方法，通过从当前状态出发的短期模拟，显著提高了业务过程性能预测的准确性。

Abstract: Business process simulation is an approach to evaluate business process
changes prior to implementation. Existing methods in this field primarily
support tactical decision-making, where simulations start from an empty state
and aim to estimate the long-term effects of process changes. A complementary
use-case is operational decision-making, where the goal is to forecast
short-term performance based on ongoing cases and to analyze the impact of
temporary disruptions, such as demand spikes and shortfalls in available
resources. An approach to tackle this use-case is to run a long-term simulation
up to a point where the workload is similar to the current one (warm-up), and
measure performance thereon. However, this approach does not consider the
current state of ongoing cases and resources in the process. This paper studies
an alternative approach that initializes the simulation from a representation
of the current state derived from an event log of ongoing cases. The paper
addresses two challenges in operationalizing this approach: (1) Given a
simulation model, what information is needed so that a simulation run can start
from the current state of cases and resources? (2) How can the current state of
a process be derived from an event log? The resulting short-term simulation
approach is embodied in a simulation engine that takes as input a simulation
model and a log of ongoing cases, and simulates cases for a given time horizon.
An experimental evaluation shows that this approach yields more accurate
short-term performance forecasts than long-term simulations with warm-up
period, particularly in the presence of concept drift or bursty performance
patterns.

Motivation: 研究论文通常无法在有限的页面内包含所有相关数据、工件和材料，外部存储库（如GitHub）对于提高研究透明度和促进可重复性至关重要。本研究旨在评估HICSS会议论文利用此类存储库提供补充材料的程度。

Method: 收集2017-2024年HICSS会议录中的5579篇论文，识别涉及人类主体研究（850篇）或技术实现（737篇）或两者兼有（147篇）的论文，共计2028篇。审查论文文本，统计包含外部存储库链接的论文数量，并检查存储库内容。

Result: 在2028篇相关论文中，只有3%的论文拥有功能正常、公开可用且可供下游研究使用的存储库。

Conclusion: HICSS会议论文在利用外部存储库支持研究可重复性方面存在严重不足，需要采取措施提高研究透明度和材料共享。

Abstract: Every day, new discoveries are made by researchers from all across the globe
and fields. HICSS is a flagship venue to present and discuss such scientific
advances. Yet, the activities carried out for any given research can hardly be
fully contained in a single document of a few pages-the "paper." Indeed, any
given study entails data, artifacts, or other material that is crucial to truly
appreciate the contributions claimed in the corresponding paper. External
repositories (e.g., GitHub) are a convenient tool to store all such resources
so that future work can freely observe and build upon them -- thereby improving
transparency and promoting reproducibility of research as a whole. In this
work, we scrutinize the extent to which papers recently accepted to HICSS
leverage such repositories to provide supplementary material. To this end, we
collect all the 5579 papers included in HICSS proceedings from 2017-2024. Then,
we identify those entailing either human subject research (850) or technical
implementations (737), or both (147). Finally, we review their text, examining
how many include a link to an external repository-and, inspect its contents.
Overall, out of 2028 papers, only 3\% have a functional and publicly available

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) has opened up new opportunities in the area of cybersecurity, especially
in the exploitation automation landscape and penetration testing. This study
explores Android penetration testing automation using LLM-based tools,
especially PentestGPT, to identify and execute rooting techniques. Through a
comparison of the traditional manual rooting process and exploitation methods
produced using AI, this study evaluates the efficacy, reliability, and
scalability of automated penetration testing in achieving high-level privilege
access on Android devices. With the use of an Android emulator (Genymotion) as
the testbed, we fully execute both traditional and exploit-based rooting
methods, automating the process using AI-generated scripts. Secondly, we create
a web application by integrating OpenAI's API to facilitate automated script
generation from LLM-processed responses. The research focuses on the
effectiveness of AI-enabled exploitation by comparing automated and manual
penetration testing protocols, by determining LLM weaknesses and strengths
along the way. We also provide security suggestions of AI-enabled exploitation,
including ethical factors and potential misuse. The findings exhibit that while
LLMs can significantly streamline the workflow of exploitation, they need to be
controlled by humans to ensure accuracy and ethical application. This study
adds to the increasing body of literature on AI-powered cybersecurity and its
effect on ethical hacking, security research, and mobile device security.

### [180] [Estimating Social Network Models with Link Misclassification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07343)
*Arthur Lewbel,Xi Qu,Xun Tang*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出了针对社交网络模型中二元网络链接误分类问题的调整2SLS估计器，解决了因误分类导致的内生性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交网络数据中二元链接经常存在误分类问题（如调查回忆错误或数据输入错误），这会导致回归变量与误差项之间产生新的相关性，使所有协变量内生化，从而使传统估计器失效

Method: 构建了误分类率的新估计器，使用这些估计来调整内生的同伴结果，并为2SLS估计构建新的工具变量。该方法不需要对链接形成进行结构建模

Result: 模拟结果证实调整后的2SLS估计器能够纠正忽略误分类并使用传统工具变量的朴素2SLS估计器的偏差

Conclusion: 该方法成功应用于研究印度村庄家庭参与小额信贷计划的同伴效应，为解决网络数据误分类问题提供了有效的估计框架

Abstract: We propose an adjusted 2SLS estimator for social network models when reported
binary network links are misclassified (some zeros reported as ones and vice
versa) due, e.g., to survey respondents' recall errors, or lapses in data
input. We show misclassification adds new sources of correlation between the
regressors and errors, which makes all covariates endogenous and invalidates
conventional estimators. We resolve these issues by constructing a novel
estimator of misclassification rates and using those estimates to both adjust
endogenous peer outcomes and construct new instruments for 2SLS estimation. A
distinctive feature of our method is that it does not require structural
modeling of link formation. Simulation results confirm our adjusted 2SLS
estimator corrects the bias from a naive, unadjusted 2SLS estimator which
ignores misclassification and uses conventional instruments. We apply our
method to study peer effects in household decisions to participate in a
microfinance program in Indian villages.

### [181] [Individual utilities of life satisfaction reveal inequality aversion unrelated to political alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07793)
*Crispin Cooper,Ana Friedrich,Tommaso Reggiani,Wouter Poortinga*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究通过英国代表性样本实验发现，多数人表现出风险规避的效用曲线，对社会生活满意度不平等比个人风险更敏感，这种公平偏好超越政治立场，挑战了平均生活满意度作为政策指标的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社会福祉应如何优先排序，以及人们在公平与个人福祉之间愿意做出何种权衡，研究社会福祉分配中的公平偏好问题。

Method: 使用英国全国代表性样本（n=300）进行陈述偏好实验，在不确定性条件下评估自己和他人的生活满意度结果，采用期望效用最大化框架估计个体效用函数，并测试对累积前景理论中小概率超权重现象的敏感性。

Result: 大多数参与者显示凹性（风险规避）效用曲线，对社会生活满意度不平等比个人风险表现出更强的规避态度，这些偏好与政治立场无关，表明存在跨越意识形态界限的共享规范性立场。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了将平均生活满意度作为政策指标的做法，支持开发更能准确反映集体人类价值的非线性效用基础替代方案，对公共政策、福祉测量和价值对齐AI系统设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: How should well-being be prioritised in society, and what trade-offs are
people willing to make between fairness and personal well-being? We investigate
these questions using a stated preference experiment with a nationally
representative UK sample (n = 300), in which participants evaluated life
satisfaction outcomes for both themselves and others under conditions of
uncertainty. Individual-level utility functions were estimated using an
Expected Utility Maximisation (EUM) framework and tested for sensitivity to the
overweighting of small probabilities, as characterised by Cumulative Prospect
Theory (CPT). A majority of participants displayed concave (risk-averse)
utility curves and showed stronger aversion to inequality in societal life
satisfaction outcomes than to personal risk. These preferences were unrelated
to political alignment, suggesting a shared normative stance on fairness in
well-being that cuts across ideological boundaries. The results challenge use
of average life satisfaction as a policy metric, and support the development of
nonlinear utility-based alternatives that more accurately reflect collective
human values. Implications for public policy, well-being measurement, and the
design of value-aligned AI systems are discussed.

### [182] [Efficient Defection: Overage-Proportional Rationing Attains the Cooperative Frontier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07145)
*Florian Lengyel*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了一种非合作性的n玩家松维分配游戏，其中玩家通过选择申请量来分配超额和松维，并证明自私结果与合作性付费相一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究松维分配游戏的动机是为了理解在非合作情况下，如何通过设计适当的清算规则来实现效率分配，并将理论应用于碳排放配额政策。

Method: 构建了一个非合作性游戏模型，每个玩家有权利L_j>0并选择申请量C_j≥0，通过计算超额v_j和松维s_j，采用超额比例清算规则分配合作余额I。

Result: 证明了：(i)自私结果与合作性付费向量(L_1,…,L_n)一致；(ii)在有界动作下，逃离是弱优势策略；(iii)线性规则是唯一边界连续成员；(iv)优势策略结果在可转移效用下是强纳什平衡。

Conclusion: 该游戏模型通过设计适当的清算机制，在非合作情况下也能实现效率分配，并可应用于碳排放配额等政策预期效果的分析。

Abstract: We study a noncooperative $n$-player game of slack allocation in which each
player $j$ has entitlement $L_j>0$ and chooses a claim $C_j\ge0$. Let
$v_j=(C_j-L_j)_+$ (overage) and $s_j=(L_j-C_j)_+$ (slack); set $X=\sum_j v_j$
and $I=\sum_j s_j$. At the end of the period an overage-proportional clearing
rule allocates cooperative surplus $I$ to defectors in proportion to $v_j$;
cooperators receive $C_j$. We show: (i) the selfish outcome reproduces the
cooperative payoff vector $(L_1,\dots,L_n)$; (ii) with bounded actions,
defection is a weakly dominant strategy; (iii) within the $\alpha$-power
family, the linear rule ($\alpha=1$) is the unique boundary-continuous member;
and (iv) the dominant-strategy outcome is Strong Nash under transferable
utility and hence coalition-proof (Bernheim et al., 1987). We give a policy
interpretation for carbon rationing with a penalty collar.

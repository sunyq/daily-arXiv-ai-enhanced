However, implementing distributed tracing in\nlarge-scale applications remains challenging due to the need for extensive\ninstrumentation. To reduce this burden, zero-code instrumentation solutions,\nsuch as those based on eBPF, have emerged, allowing span data to be collected\nwithout modifying application code. Despite this promise, span correlation, the\nprocess of establishing causal relationships between spans, remains a critical\nchallenge in zero-code approaches. Existing solutions often rely on thread\naffinity, compromise system security by requiring the kernel integrity mode to\nbe disabled, or incur significant computational overhead due to complex\ninference algorithms. This paper presents CrossTrace, a practical and efficient\ndistributed tracing solution designed to support the debugging of microservice\napplications without requiring source code modifications. CrossTrace employs a\ngreedy algorithm to infer intra-service span relationships from delay patterns,\neliminating reliance on thread identifiers. For inter-service correlation,\nCrossTrace embeds span identifiers into TCP packet headers via eBPF, enabling\nsecure and efficient correlation compromising system security policies.\nEvaluation results show that CrossTrace can correlate thousands of spans within\nseconds with over 90% accuracy, making it suitable for production deployment\nand valuable for microservice observability and diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "CrossTrace\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u548ceBPF\u6280\u672f\u9ad8\u6548\u5173\u8054\u8de8\u670d\u52a1\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u96f6\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e2d\u8de8\u670d\u52a1\u5173\u8054\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u65ad\u670d\u52a1\u5185\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7eBPF\u5728TCP\u5305\u5934\u5d4c\u5165\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u670d\u52a1\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51e0\u79d2\u5185\u4ee5\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5173\u8054\u6570\u5343\u6761\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "CrossTrace\u4e3a\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u8c03\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The main estimation methodology is built on the eigenanalysis of\nsample row and column covariance matrices when the nonstationary matrix factors\nare of full rank and the idiosyncratic components are temporally stationary,\nand is further extended to tackle a more flexible setting when the matrix\nfactors are cointegrated and the idiosyncratic components may be nonstationary.\nUnder some mild conditions which allow the existence of weak factors, we derive\nthe convergence theory for the estimated factor loading matrices and\nnonstationary factor matrices.

To this end, we translate the first-order ASPIC+ instance into a\nDatalog program and query a Datalog engine to obtain ground substitutions to\nperform the grounding of rules and contraries. Additionally, we propose\nsimplifications specific to the ASPIC+ formalism to avoid grounding of rules\nthat have no influence on the reasoning process.

In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a\nthree-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal\ncapacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware\noptimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.\nExperimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that\nour framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve\nnear-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

We introduce the concepts of\nElement Tokens and Everything Tokens: elemental tokens represent standardized,\nfully collateralized components of an asset (e.g., outputs, rights, or\ncredits), while an everything token represents the entire asset as a fixed\ncombination of those elements. The architecture enables both fine-grained\npartial ownership and integrated whole-asset ownership through a system of\ntwo-way convertibility. We detail the design and mechanics of this system,\nincluding an arbitrage mechanism that keeps the price of the composite token\naligned with the net asset value of its constituents.

While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image\noffers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial\nscene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy.

It allows processes to delay the visibility of\nwrites through store buffering. While this supports hardware-level\noptimizations and makes a significant contribution to multiprocessor\nefficiency, it complicates reasoning about correctness, as executions may\nviolate sequential consistency. Ensuring correct behavior often requires\ninserting synchronization primitives such as memory fences ($F$) or atomic\nread-modify-write ($RMW$) operations, but this approach can incur significant\nperformance costs. In this work, we develop a semantic framework that precisely\ncharacterizes when such synchronization is necessary under TSO. We introduce a\nnovel TSO-specific occurs-before relation, which adapts Lamport's celebrated\nhappens-before relation from asynchronous message-passing systems to the TSO\nsetting. Our main result is a theorem that proves that the only way to ensure\nthat two events that take place at different sites are temporally ordered is by\nhaving the execution create an occurs-before chain between the events. By\nstudying the role of fences and $RMW$s in creating occurs-before chains, we are\nthen able to capture cases in which these costly synchronization operations are\nunavoidable.

To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several\ncontinual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to\nefficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining\nlearned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world\nscenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of\nupdates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In\nthis paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for\nCKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on\nthe update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic\nDistillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of\nlearned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts.

However, these methods face two key limitations:\n(1) they overlook the significant variation in difficulty across different GUI\ntasks by treating the entire training data as a uniform set, which hampers the\nagent's ability to adapt its learning process; and (2) most approaches collapse\ntask-specific nuances into a single, coarse reward, leaving the agent with a\nuniform signal that yields inefficient policy updates. To address these\nlimitations, we propose CRAFT-GUI, a curriculum learning framework based on\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that explicitly accounts for the\nvarying difficulty across trajectories. To enable more fine-grained policy\noptimization, we design a reward function that combines simple rule-based\nsignals with model-judged evaluation, providing richer and more nuanced\nfeedback during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nachieves significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art approaches,\noutperforming them by 5.6% on public benchmarks Android Control and 10.3% on\nour internal online benchmarks, respectively.

However, in extreme degradation scenarios\n(e.g., scale $> 8\\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often\nseverely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models\nto reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to\ngenerate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images\nlacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nFSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID\nrestoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.\nOur approach involves three key designs: 1) \\textbf{Masking} the facial region\nin the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)\n\\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style\nguidance; 3) Leveraging \\textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)\nimages for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first\npretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing\nit to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity\nembeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform\nlightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID\nimages.

The resulting\nbenchmark comprises 1,011 code translation tasks across C++, Java, and Python,\neach accompanied by an average of 22.1 verified reference translations and 10\ncomputationally demanding tests. Our extensive evaluation of 26 representative\nLLMs reveals that even top-tier LLMs struggle to consistently produce efficient\ncode translations. For instance, Claude-4-think, the leading model for\ncorrectness, ranks eighth overall when time efficiency is taken into account,\nsurpassed by several smaller open-source models. We further pinpoint that\nalgorithmic flaws and improper resource handling are the most detrimental,\ncausing a median time slowdown of 5.6$\\times$ and memory increase of\n12.0$\\times$, respectively.

In particular, the most complete temporal network\nthat we could obtain contains 7 time instances and 42 microservices, which\nlimits the potential analysis that could be applied.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ece\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u65f6\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u65f6\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u4ec5\u5305\u542b7\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c42\u4e2a\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5e7f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5168\u9762\u7684\u65f6\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7814\u7a76\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This poses\na significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the\ndiverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a\ncomplete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection,\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using\nOpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000\nframes captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather\nscenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This\ndataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to\nperform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video\nframes. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected\npotholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and\nframes as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly\nweb interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under\nchallenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road\nassessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the\nwebsite.

Inspired by human object\ncategorisation, object property reasoning involves identifying and recognising\nlow-level details and higher-level abstractions. While current VQA benchmarks\nconsider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically\nblend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of\nreasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic\nevaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning\nlevels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by\nprior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this\nbenchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object\nproperties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based\nquestions.

Traditional\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained\ntextual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed\nknowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods\naddress this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural\nassociations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and\nfine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization\nof textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called\nHGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and\nsemantic information via hypergraphs. Structurally, we construct an entity\nhypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained\npassages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared\nentities. Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates\nfine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via\nhypergraph diffusion.

While ControlNet grants\nprecise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases\nlatency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and\ndenoising steps, especially for video.

This significantly curtails the development of models capable\nof deep, multi-view 3D scene understanding over distant objects. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce MV-ScanQA, a novel 3D question answering dataset\nwhere 68% of questions explicitly require integrating information from multiple\nviews (compared to less than 7% in existing datasets), thereby rigorously\ntesting multi-view compositional reasoning. To facilitate the training of\nmodels for such demanding scenarios, we present TripAlign dataset, a\nlarge-scale and low-cost 2D-3D-language pre-training corpus containing 1M <2D\nview, set of 3D objects, text> triplets that explicitly aligns groups of\ncontextually related objects with text, providing richer, view-grounded\nmulti-object multimodal alignment signals than previous single-object\nannotations.

With AI, we can now extract detailed\nmeasurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D\nclinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define\nbody composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using\nlarge-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal\npatterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full\ncohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese\n(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms\nabdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through\nsegmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random\nforest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection\nthrough SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns\n(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences\n(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.\nThere were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal\nmuscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or\nfat-laden pancreas.

While existing training-free\napproaches show promise, they often rely on surface-level statistics and\noverlook fundamental signal properties of the text generation process. In this\nwork, we reframe detection as a signal processing problem, introducing a novel\nparadigm that analyzes the sequence of token log-probabilities in the frequency\ndomain. By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the\nglobal Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier\nTransform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits\nsignificantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the\nlarger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the\nsuppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text.

Finally, we extend our analysis to GPT-4.1 and\nDeepSeek V3 to assess frontier models' current robustness to format\nperturbations. Our findings offer actionable insights into the relative\neffectiveness of these robustness methods, enabling practitioners to make\ninformed decisions when aiming for stable and reliable LLM performance in\nreal-world applications.

To\naddress this issue, we propose a residual-based efficient bidirectional\ndiffusion model (RBDM) that can model the conditional distributions for both\ndehazing and haze generation. Firstly, we devise dual Markov chains that can\neffectively shift the residuals and facilitate bidirectional smooth transitions\nbetween them. Secondly, the RBDM perturbs the hazy and haze-free images at\nindividual timesteps and predicts the noise in the perturbed data to\nsimultaneously learn the conditional distributions. Finally, to enhance\nperformance on relatively small datasets and reduce computational costs, our\nmethod introduces a unified score function learned on image patches instead of\nentire images. Our RBDM successfully implements size-agnostic bidirectional\ntransitions between haze-free and hazy images with only 15 sampling steps.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or\nat least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic\nand real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u53cc\u5411\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08RBDM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u96fe\u548c\u65e0\u96fe\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u53bb\u96fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u80fd\u53bb\u9664\u96fe\u973e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u96fe\u548c\u65e0\u96fe\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53cc\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u4ee5\u5e73\u6ed1\u8f6c\u6362\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "RBDM\u5728\u4ec515\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5411\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5ab2\u7f8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RBDM\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5c3a\u5bf8\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u96fe\u973e\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002"}}

We evaluate the effect of finetuning on the model's behavior in two\nways; first, we assess how answers change on in-domain, held-out survey\nquestions. Second, we evaluate whether the model's behavior changes in\nout-of-domain settings (situational scenarios). To this end, we construct a\ncontextualized moral judgment dataset based on Reddit posts and evaluate\nchanges in the model's behavior in text-based adventure games. We demonstrate\nthat our simple approach can not only change the model's answers to in-domain\nsurvey questions, but also produces substantial shifts (value alignment) in\nimplicit downstream task behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u56de\u7b54\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8c03\u67e5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u5176\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u8c03\u6574LLM\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaLLM\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u4f7f\u5176\u56de\u7b54\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8c03\u67e5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u57df\u5185\u548c\u57df\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8c03\u67e5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5728\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u6574LLM\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and\ntransmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which\nlimits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection\n(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain\nadaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training\nparadigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse\ncaused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense\nobjects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain\nannotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision\nfoundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised\nframework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision\nFoundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a \"free lunch\" manner,\nleveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise\nwhile improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we\nintroduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's\nsemantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated\npseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from\nlow-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and\nquantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,\nwhich aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and\nimage levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and\nsimilarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further\nenhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in\nsource-free remote sensing detection tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "VG-DETR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFM\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5bc6\u96c6\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8fdc\u7a0b\u611f\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u9650\u5236\u4f7f\u5f97\u6e90\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SFOD\uff09\u56e0\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFM\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "VG-DETR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdVFM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6316\u6398\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53cc\u7ea7VFM\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u5229\u7528VFM\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVG-DETR\u5728\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u8fdc\u7a0b\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "VG-DETR\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408VFM\u548c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SFOD\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This is a challenging\nproblem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the\nnewly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.\nMost CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery\nand classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the\nprocess of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use\nknowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more\nstorage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based\nDiversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes\nindependent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module,\nand continuous increment by orthogonality module.

Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and\npatch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly\nallocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in\nlow-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging\nwithout explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this\nwork, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video\ntokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We\nfirst extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a\nset of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian\nEmbedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D\nGaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp.,\nlower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information\ncontent during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding\nper-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a\nGaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into\nstatic and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across\ndifferent time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a\ncompact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction,\nwhile also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression\nusing the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets.

Building on research on fairness and\ndiscrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --\ndiscrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human\nanimals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In\nour benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely\ncondemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In\nopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized\nharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.\nThese findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and\nmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms\naround animal exploitation.

However, existing methods struggle to align with\nfine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion\nnaturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the\ndifficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often\nconflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality\ndatasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we\nfirst introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns\nhuman-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy\nmultidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a\nlarge-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K\npreference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert\nPreference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based\nportrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO\ndecouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused\nacross timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained\nenhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments\ndemonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in\naligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial\nimprovements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and\nvisual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations.

To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always\nensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces\nthe classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in\nDC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the\ninstability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two\nprinciples: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,\nwe propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)\nnoise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a\ndataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly\ninitialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a\nMeta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise\noffset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to\nreplace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the\neffectiveness of NoOp.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNoOp\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08DC\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u5339\u914d\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5339\u914d\u539f\u5219\u4f18\u5316\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6269\u6563\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08DC\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u91c7\u6837\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNoOp\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u5339\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5339\u914d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5143\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u66ff\u6362\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86NoOp\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "NoOp\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DC\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

When adopting a transformer-based detection model to\nperform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning\nthe detection performance on previously learned categories may severely\ndegenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)\nto mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based\ndetection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a\ncorrespondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase\ndetection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched\nqueries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,\nHungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of\nthe current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at\ndifferent iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each\nquery may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of\npreviously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we\npropose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation\n(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD\nestablishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase\nmodels that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned\ndistillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of\nprevious categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic\nand spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new\ncategories.

This\ntarget label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model\nto predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model\npredictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability,\nreproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided\nframework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge\ntransfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate\nseveral state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity\nsources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect\nto the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios.

Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often\nstruggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In\nthis study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot\nsegmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first\ntrains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to\nproduce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically\nprocessed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,\nwhich are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The\nproposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice\ncoefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that\nCoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated\nwith conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation\nresults. The pipeline's speed and annotation efficiency make it well-suited for\nresearch and hold strong potential for clinical applications in renal\npathology.

We further advance this paradigm\nthrough a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception into\nthe planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided by\nevolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning\nperformance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled\nperception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. By\nincorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, the\nperception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements along\nthese trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planning\ntrajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and the\nplanning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt an\nautoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories while\nfocusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step. With this\nsimple yet effective design, VeteranAD fully unleashes the potential of\nplanning-oriented end-to-end methods, leading to more accurate and reliable\ndriving behavior.

However, this efficiency often compromises the\nexpense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their\nability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To\novercome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes\nhighly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized\nenhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG)\nand aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state\ninteraction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while\nincurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking\nrobustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple\nstate representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE\nrefines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates\ninformation exchange between these states and ensures the integration of\ncomplementary features.

However, existing approaches struggle\nto effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended\nsettings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in\nadvance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for\nmulti-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is\nmotivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains\nproduce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when\noperating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base\nmodel than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two\nobservations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,\nwhich nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method\noperates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing\ncosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base\nmodel. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight\nmatrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain\ndrift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that\nincorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We\nextend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling\ninference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently\noffers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform\ndiverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning\ncapabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this\ndirection by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for\nenabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by\nautonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and\ncomputational operations via executable code. This approach not only\nfacilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,\nrotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,\nall while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these\noperations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:\nan initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,\nfollowed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually\ncollect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the\nlearning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies\ndistinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning\nexploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental\nanalysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20\nbenchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,\nparticularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning\ntasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faThyme\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5982\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff08O3\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51faThyme\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Thyme\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08SFT\u548cRL\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faGRPO-ATS\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fd120\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cThyme\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Thyme\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6267\u884c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

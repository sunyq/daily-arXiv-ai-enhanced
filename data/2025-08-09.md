### [1] [Prescriptive Agents based on Rag for Automated Maintenance (PARAM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04714)
*Chitranshu Harbola,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的智能系统，用于工业机械的预测性维护，结合振动频率分析和多代理生成技术，提供可操作的维护建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业机械维护需要及时干预以防止灾难性故障并优化运行效率，传统方法仅能检测异常，缺乏具体的维护建议。

Method: 系统将轴承振动数据（BPFO、BPFI等）转化为自然语言供LLM处理，结合多代理技术分析维护手册和网络信息，生成结构化维护建议。

Result: 实验验证显示系统能有效检测异常并提供上下文相关的维护指导，填补了状态监测与可操作维护计划之间的空白。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了LLM在工业维护中的应用，为跨机械组件和工业领域的预测性维护提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理分解中隐含API选择，缺乏明确指导，GeoFlow旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 为每个代理提供详细的工具调用目标，指导运行时地理空间API调用。

Result: 代理成功率提升6.8%，令牌使用减少四倍。

Conclusion: GeoFlow在提升代理效率和减少资源消耗方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present GeoFlow, a method that automatically generates agentic workflows
for geospatial tasks. Unlike prior work that focuses on reasoning decomposition
and leaves API selection implicit, our method provides each agent with detailed
tool-calling objectives to guide geospatial API invocation at runtime. GeoFlow
increases agentic success by 6.8% and reduces token usage by up to fourfold
across major LLM families compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过对抗性棋盘游戏评估大型语言模型（LLM）性能的框架，弥补了主流问答基准方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 棋盘游戏作为战略推理和智能的典型领域，是评估AI系统的理想基准。

Method: 引入Qi Town平台，支持5种游戏和20个LLM驱动的玩家，使用Elo评分系统和性能循环图（PLG）定量评估LLM技术能力，并通过积极情感分数（PSS）评估心理适应性。

Result: 实验表明，尽管技术差异显著，多数LLM在对抗环境中表现乐观且适应性强，但PLG揭示了其技能不稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM评估提供了新视角，但需进一步研究LLM在游戏中的技能不稳定性。

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 比较了三种实现自主网络地理信息系统（AWebGIS）的方法，发现基于小型语言模型（SLM）的客户端方法在准确性和隐私保护方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前基于云的大型语言模型（LLM）方案在隐私、可扩展性和网络依赖性方面的问题。

Method: 比较了三种方法：1）基于云LLM的在线方法；2）基于经典机器学习分类器的半自动化离线方法；3）基于客户端SLM的完全离线方法。

Result: 客户端SLM方法在准确性（0.93精确匹配）和效率（0.99 Levenshtein相似度）上表现最佳，同时减轻了服务器负担。

Conclusion: 客户端SLM方法为AWebGIS提供了高效、隐私友好的解决方案，适合浏览器端执行。

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

### [5] [Large Language Models Reasoning Abilities Under Non-Ideal Conditions After RL-Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04848)
*Chang Tian,Matthew B. Blaschko,Mingzhe Xing,Xiuxing Li,Yinliang Yue,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 强化学习（RL）用于提升大语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力，但在非理想场景下性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽略了大语言模型在现实非理想场景下的表现，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过RL微调LLMs和大型视觉语言模型（LVLM），并在三种非理想场景下评估性能。

Result: RL微调在理想场景下提升推理能力，但在非理想场景中性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 大模型的推理能力被高估，需在非理想场景下评估模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data
will be released at XXXX.

*Huiya Zhao,Yinghao Zhu,Zixiang Wang,Yasha Wang,Junyi Gao,Liantao Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthFlow是一种自我进化的AI代理，通过元级进化机制提升策略规划能力，显著优于现有框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理在医疗研究中依赖静态策略，无法成为更好的策略规划者，限制了其效能。

Method: 引入HealthFlow，通过元级进化机制自主优化问题解决策略，并开发EHRFlowBench基准进行评测。

Result: 实验表明HealthFlow在复杂医疗数据分析任务中表现显著优于现有框架。

Conclusion: 该研究标志着从工具使用者向自我进化任务管理者的转变，为更自主的AI科学发现铺平道路。

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

### [7] [The Docking Game: Loop Self-Play for Fast, Dynamic, and Accurate Prediction of Flexible Protein--Ligand Binding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05006)
*Youzhi Zhang,Yufei Li,Gaofeng Meng,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于博弈论的新型分子对接框架LoopPlay，通过交替训练配体和蛋白质模块，显著提升了对接准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子对接模型在配体对接上表现不佳，主要由于配体和蛋白质结构复杂性差异。

Method: 将蛋白-配体交互建模为双玩家博弈，开发LoopPlay算法，通过内外循环交替训练模块。

Result: 在公开数据集上，LoopPlay比现有方法提升约10%的准确率。

Conclusion: LoopPlay有望提升药物发现中分子对接的准确性。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

### [8] [Can Large Language Models Integrate Spatial Data? Empirical Insights into Reasoning Strengths and Computational Weaknesses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05009)
*Bin Han,Robert Wolfe,Anat Caspi,Bill Howe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探索了大型语言模型（LLMs）在整合城市空间数据中的应用，发现其在特定条件下表现优异，但需结合人工修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规则方法无法覆盖所有边缘案例，机器学习方法需要大量标注数据，LLMs提供了一种灵活替代方案。

Method: 分析了LLMs的空间推理能力，提出了一种结合特征输入和人工修正的“审查-优化”方法。

Result: LLMs在减少对空间推理依赖时表现良好，结合修正方法能显著提升结果质量。

Conclusion: LLMs是传统规则方法的有效替代，未来可结合多模态和多样化数据格式进一步优化。

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合离线模仿学习和在线探索的Web导航智能体框架CogniWeb，受人类双系统认知理论启发，实现了高效且性能优越的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web导航是评估通用人工智能（AGI）的关键领域，但现有方法未能有效整合离线学习和在线探索。

Method: 受人类双系统认知理论启发，将智能体分解为快速直觉（System 1）和慢速推理（System 2）模块，并实现为CogniWeb框架。

Result: 在WebArena上的评估显示，CogniWeb实现了43.96%的成功率，同时显著提高了效率（减少75%的token使用）。

Conclusion: CogniWeb通过结合双系统认知理论，为Web导航智能体提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

*Dexuan Xu,Jieyi Wang,Zhongyan Chai,Yongzhi Cao,Hanpin Wang,Huamin Zhang,Yu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个多模态医学知识编辑基准MedMKEB，用于评估医学大语言模型的知识编辑能力，填补了现有研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学知识不断更新，需要让多模态大语言模型能够高效更新过时或错误信息，而无需从头训练。目前缺乏针对医学多模态知识编辑的系统性基准。

Method: 基于高质量医学视觉问答数据集构建MedMKEB，包含反事实修正、语义泛化、知识迁移和对抗鲁棒性等编辑任务，并通过专家验证确保准确性。

Result: 实验表明现有知识编辑方法在医学领域存在局限性，需要开发专门的编辑策略。

Conclusion: MedMKEB将成为推动可信高效医学知识编辑算法发展的标准基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

*Xinyue Wu,Fan Hu,Shaik Jani Babu,Yi Zhao,Xinfei Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EasySize是一个基于微调Qwen3-8B模型的轻量级门尺寸优化框架，适用于不同工艺节点、设计规范和电路拓扑，显著减少人工依赖和计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟电路设计中，门尺寸优化是一个耗时且依赖经验的任务，现有AI方法通用性不足且计算资源消耗大。

Method: 结合微调Qwen3-8B模型和启发式搜索技术，动态构建任务特定损失函数，采用全局差分进化和局部粒子群优化。

Result: 在多个工艺节点上表现优异，优于AutoCkt框架，并减少96.67%的仿真资源。

Conclusion: EasySize能显著简化模拟电路设计流程，减少对专家经验和计算资源的依赖。

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI如何重塑知识生成与验证，并探索其在教育中的潜力，尤其是如何通过结构化对话促进学生的高阶思维能力。

Method: 采用对照实验，比较65名德国职前教师学生使用苏格拉底式AI导师与普通AI聊天机器人的效果。

Result: 使用苏格拉底式AI导师的学生在批判性、独立性和反思性思维方面表现显著更优。

Conclusion: 研究为多代理系统在教育中的应用提供了实证支持，并提出了未来混合学习生态系统的概念框架。

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于异构图神经网络（Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network）的方法，用于修复过程挖掘中事件日志的缺失属性，相比现有方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的事件日志常因数据采集问题导致信息缺失，现有方法或依赖流程模型，或仅修复部分属性，无法全面解决问题。

Method: 开发了一种异构图神经网络模型，能够处理不完整事件，并修复所有缺失属性。

Result: 在两个合成日志和四个真实日志上评估，模型在修复所有事件属性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 异构图神经网络方法在事件日志修复中具有显著优势，能够全面修复缺失属性。

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QA-Dragon是一个查询感知的动态RAG系统，通过混合文本和图像检索策略，提升复杂VQA任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法仅从文本或图像中检索，无法处理需要多跳推理或最新知识的复杂查询。

Method: QA-Dragon引入领域路由器和搜索路由器，动态选择检索策略，支持多模态、多轮和多跳推理。

Result: 在KDD Cup 2025的Meta CRAG-MM挑战中，QA-Dragon显著提升推理性能，单源、多源和多轮任务分别优于基线5.06%、6.35%和5.03%。

Conclusion: QA-Dragon通过动态混合检索策略，有效解决了复杂VQA任务中的知识获取和推理问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

Our solution enables communication owners to formulate intuitive queries
combining concepts such as equipment, manufacturers, maintenance engineers, and
facilities, delivering explainable results that maintain trust in the system
while improving communication efficiency across the organization.

### [16] [A Novel Architecture for Symbolic Reasoning with Decision Trees and LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05311)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合架构，将基于决策树的符号推理与大型语言模型（LLMs）的生成能力结合在多智能体框架中，提升了推理性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法松散耦合符号与神经模块，缺乏统一性和一致性，本设计旨在通过紧密集成符号推理与LLMs，实现更高效、可解释的推理。

Method: 将决策树和随机森林作为可调用模块嵌入统一推理系统，LLM处理归纳推理和规划，中央协调器维护状态一致性并协调通信。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，如ProofWriter（+7.2%）、GSM8k（+5.3%）和ARC（+6.0%），并在临床和科学领域展示了实用性。

Conclusion: 该架构为通用神经符号推理提供了鲁棒、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

### [17] [The Term 'Agent' Has Been Diluted Beyond Utility and Requires Redefinition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05338)
*Brinnae Bent*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出重新定义AI中的'agent'术语，以解决多义性带来的研究、评估和政策挑战，并提出了一个多维框架来明确其定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI领域中对'agent'术语的多义性，导致研究交流、系统评估和政策制定中存在挑战，需要重新定义以提升清晰度。

Method: 通过历史分析和当代使用模式，提出一个多维框架，定义'agent'的最低要求，并描述其在环境交互、学习与适应、自主性、目标复杂性和时间一致性等方面的特征。

Result: 提出了一个明确的术语框架，为系统描述提供精确词汇，同时保留术语的历史多面性。

Conclusion: 建议采用标准化术语和框架，以提升研究清晰度和可复现性，支持更有效的政策制定。

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple
interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI
capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this
ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system
evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了NomicLaw，一个多智能体模拟框架，用于研究LLM在开放法律和伦理困境中的行为，通过投票和语言策略分析信任与互惠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在开放多智能体环境中处理法律和伦理问题的行为，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用NomicLaw模拟框架，让LLM参与协作立法，通过提出规则、论证和投票来量化信任与互惠。

Result: 实验显示LLM能自发形成联盟、背叛信任，并调整语言策略以影响集体决策。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了开源LLM的社会推理和说服能力，为未来AI在法律场景中的自主协商和立法设计提供了参考。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including
legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However,
empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings
especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains
limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs
engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by
proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We
quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and
qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and
influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM
groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and
adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the
latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and
provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous
negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

TL;DR: StructVRM提出了一种结构化可验证奖励模型，用于解决多模态模型在复杂推理任务中的部分正确性问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励机制在复杂多问题推理任务中表现不足，无法提供细粒度的反馈，限制了模型的学习效果。

Method: 引入StructVRM，通过训练模型验证器提供细粒度的子问题级反馈，评估语义和数学等价性。

Result: Seed-StructVRM在12个多模态基准测试中的6个及新STEM-Bench上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 结构化可验证奖励训练是提升多模态模型复杂推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于智能交通系统的实时数据驱动预测性维护方法，包含预处理、增量分类和结果解释模块，实验结果显示高准确性和F-measure。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决铁路预测性维护中实时故障预测和解释的需求，以提高服务可用性和安全性。

Method: 采用包含样本预处理、增量分类和解释模块的在线处理流程，结合统计和频率特征。

Result: 在MetroPT数据集上实现F-measure超过98%，准确率99%，且在类不平衡和噪声下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了其方法论的有效性和实际应用价值，支持铁路运营中的主动维护决策。

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepPHY是一个新的基准框架，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）对物理原理的理解和推理能力，发现即使最先进的VLMs也难以将描述性物理知识转化为精确的预测控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs在复杂动态环境中缺乏细节关注和精确行动规划能力，导致性能不佳，而真实任务需要复杂的物理规则理解。

Method: 引入DeepPHY框架，通过多难度模拟环境和细粒度评估指标系统评估VLMs的物理推理能力。

Result: 评估显示，即使最先进的VLMs也难以实现精确的预测控制。

Conclusion: DeepPHY为VLMs的物理推理能力提供了系统评估，揭示了其在复杂任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

Conclusion: 通过开放基准、联邦学习和可解释界面等社区倡议，LLMs有望实现快速、可靠且包容的分子创新。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how chemists plan and
run reactions in organic synthesis. Trained on millions of reported
transformations, these text-based models can propose synthetic routes, forecast
reaction outcomes and even instruct robots that execute experiments without
human supervision. Here we survey the milestones that turned LLMs from
speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular
innovation powered by artificial intelligence and automation.

Motivation: 现有AI对齐研究忽视了地理变异性，导致模型输出可能与现实不符或引发争议，亟需解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析地理敏感性问题（如文本到图像模型的输出差异），提出评估对齐敏感性的方法，并展望未来研究方向。

Result: 指出AI对齐需考虑地理背景，避免一刀切方案，并强调透明度和上下文管理的重要性。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发时空感知的AI对齐方法，以适应全球多样化的需求，确保AI行为符合不同地区的规范。

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Bench-2-CoP框架，量化了AI评估基准与欧盟AI法案之间的差距，发现现有基准严重忽视系统性风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI评估工具未能覆盖新法规关注的系统性风险，亟需填补这一“基准-法规差距”。

Method: 使用LLM-as-judge分析方法，将194,955个基准问题映射到欧盟AI法案的能力分类中。

Result: 发现评估生态严重偏向行为倾向（如幻觉倾向53.7%），而关键功能能力（如失控场景）几乎未被覆盖。

Conclusion: 研究为政策制定者和开发者提供了改进评估工具的关键依据，以促进更安全合规的AI。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC数据稀缺且现有数据集存在偏见和主观性问题，LLMs在ERC任务中的应用受限，因此需要一种高效的数据生成方法。

Method: 使用小型、资源高效的通用LLM生成六种新型ERC数据集，补充现有三大ERC基准数据集，并评估其分类性能和标签不平衡影响。

Result: 实验表明，基于生成数据集训练的ERC分类器具有强鲁棒性，并在现有基准上显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为ERC任务提供了高效的数据补充方案，解决了数据稀缺和标签不平衡问题。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在复杂任务上表现出强大的推理能力，但后训练通常需要大量数据和计算资源。现有方法依赖启发式或任务特定策略，难以扩展。

Method: InfiAlign结合SFT和DPO，通过自动数据选择管道从开源推理数据集中筛选高质量数据，显著减少数据需求。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base模型上，仅用约12%的训练数据即达到与DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B相当的性能，数学推理任务上平均提升3.89%。

Conclusion: InfiAlign通过结合数据选择和全阶段后训练，为大语言模型的扩展和数据高效对齐提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理结构化知识（如知识图谱）时表现有限，且图检索方法难以平衡全局结构和精度控制。

Method: GRAIL采用LLM引导的随机探索与路径过滤，生成细粒度推理轨迹，并通过两阶段训练学习动态决策策略。

Result: 在三个知识图谱问答数据集上，GRAIL平均准确率提升21.01%，F1值提升22.43%。

Conclusion: GRAIL通过交互式检索范式，有效平衡检索广度和精度，显著提升了知识图谱推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

Motivation: 现有评估方法（如LLM-as-a-Judge）仅关注最终输出，忽略了代理的逐步推理过程，而Agent-as-a-Judge系统又局限于特定领域。需要一种通用且全面的评估框架。

Method: 设计了一个模块化框架，将任务分解为子任务，逐步验证代理的输出和推理过程，最终汇总各模块结果生成评估结论。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了通用评估方法的潜力，能够更准确地预测代理任务完成情况。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

TL;DR: LORI是一种基于AI的工具，用于从推荐信中自动识别领导力技能，采用RoBERTa和LLAMA模型，性能优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐信评估耗时且主观，LORI旨在自动化这一过程，提供客观反馈。

Method: 使用自然语言处理和大语言模型（RoBERTa和LLAMA）分析推荐信中的领导力特征。

Result: RoBERTa模型表现优异，加权F1分数91.6%，精确率92.4%，召回率91.6%。

Conclusion: LORI能高效评估领导力技能，优化研究生录取流程。

Abstract: Letters of recommendation (LORs) provide valuable insights into candidates'
capabilities and experiences beyond standardized test scores. However,
reviewing these text-heavy materials is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To
address this challenge and support the admission committee in providing
feedback for students' professional growth, our study introduces LORI: LOR
Insights, a novel AI-based detection tool for assessing leadership skills in
LORs submitted by online master's program applicants. By employing natural
language processing and leveraging large language models using RoBERTa and
LLAMA, we seek to identify leadership attributes such as teamwork,
communication, and innovation. Our latest RoBERTa model achieves a weighted F1
score of 91.6%, a precision of 92.4%, and a recall of 91.6%, showing a strong
level of consistency in our test data. With the growing importance of
leadership skills in the STEM sector, integrating LORI into the graduate
admissions process is crucial for accurately assessing applicants' leadership
capabilities. This approach not only streamlines the admissions process but
also automates and ensures a more comprehensive evaluation of candidates'
capabilities.

### [31] [MV-Debate: Multi-view Agent Debate with Dynamic Reflection Gating for Multimodal Harmful Content Detection in Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05557)
*Rui Lu,Jinhe Bi,Yunpu Ma,Feng Xiao,Yuntao Du,Yijun Tian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MV-Debate是一种多视角代理辩论框架，用于统一检测多模态有害内容，通过动态反思门控提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中多模态内容的复杂性使得有害意图（如讽刺、仇恨言论或虚假信息）难以检测，需要跨模态分析和动态适应。

Method: MV-Debate整合了四种代理（表面分析、深度推理、模态对比和社会情境分析），通过迭代辩论和反思门控优化检测。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，MV-Debate显著优于单模型和现有多代理辩论基线。

Conclusion: 多代理辩论框架在安全关键场景中提升了社会意图检测的可靠性。

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

*Bo Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出主动推理（AIF）为解决AI系统自主学习的瓶颈问题提供关键基础，通过最小化自由能替代外部奖励信号，实现自主目标制定与适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统依赖高质量训练数据和人工奖励设计，面临可扩展性挑战，阻碍真正自主智能的发展。

Method: 结合主动推理（AIF）与大型语言模型，利用自由能最小化作为内在驱动，实现自主学习和决策。

Result: 提出一种新框架，使AI系统能高效从经验中学习，同时保持与人类价值观一致。

Conclusion: AIF为解决自主AI的"接地代理缺口"提供可行路径，推动AI在计算和物理约束下的自主发展。

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

*Yu Yuan,Lili Zhao,Wei Chen,Guangting Zheng,Kai Zhang,Mengdi Zhang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出LearnerAgent，一种基于LLM的多智能体框架，模拟真实教学环境，研究人类学习行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉学习动态或提供可解释性，需更真实模拟学习过程。

Method: 构建心理特征学习者（如Deep、Surface、Lazy）和通用学习者，通过知识获取、测试和互动跟踪学习动态。

Result: 发现不同学习者行为符合心理特征，通用学习者自我效能高但认知有限，基础LLM默认行为类似表面学习者。

Conclusion: LearnerAgent能有效模拟真实学习场景，揭示LLM行为特征。

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在对话转录后处理中添加说话者特征元数据标签的方法，结合音频基础模型和语言模型，无需任务特定微调即可实现高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在对话转录后处理中补充元数据标签（如年龄、性别、情感）以丰富转录内容，提升信息价值。

Method: 结合冻结的音频基础模型（如Whisper或WavLM）和冻结的LLAMA语言模型，通过轻量级连接器桥接音频与语言表示，推断说话者属性。

Result: 在说话者分析任务中表现优异，同时保持模块化和速度；LLAMA模型在某些场景下直接比较x-向量，等错误率为8.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需微调即可高效实现说话者特征标注，为对话转录后处理提供了新的补充手段。

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的BPE算法（Parity-aware BPE），旨在解决传统BPE算法对低资源语言的不公平问题，通过平衡各语言的压缩率，实现更公平的分词效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BPE算法依赖频率目标，导致低资源语言的分词效果较差，加剧了语言间的计算和金融不平等。

Method: 提出Parity-aware BPE算法，在每一步合并时优先优化当前压缩率最差的语言，牺牲少量全局压缩率以实现跨语言公平。

Result: 实验表明，该算法显著改善了各语言的token数量公平性，且对全局压缩率和下游任务的语言模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE是一种有效的改进方法，能够在不显著牺牲性能的前提下，提升低资源语言的分词公平性。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

Method: 提出联合ASR和音高重音检测模型，结合半监督语音表示进行训练。

Result: 音高重音检测模块的F1分数提升41%，ASR在LibriSpeech上的WER降低28.3%。

Conclusion: 联合模型证明了保留或重新学习音高重音等韵律线索的重要性。

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent

significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to

Motivation: 研究大语言模型的人格稳定性，以评估其在安全关键应用中的可靠性。

Method: 使用传统和新型人格测试工具（BFI-44、SD3等），系统测试500,000+模型响应，分析不同干预措施的效果。

Result: 发现模型行为存在显著不稳定性，提示人格对齐策略可能不足。

Conclusion: 当前LLM缺乏行为一致性的基础，人格对齐策略在安全关键应用中可能不适用。

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

Motivation: 现有协调方案依赖静态或全上下文路由策略，导致令牌消耗过多、内存冗余且适应性差。

Method: 提出RCR-Router框架，基于角色和任务阶段动态选择内存子集，使用轻量级评分策略和共享内存存储。

Result: 在三个多跳QA基准测试中，RCR-Router减少令牌使用达30%，同时保持或提高答案质量。

Conclusion: 结构化内存路由和输出感知评估对可扩展多代理LLM系统至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

Method: 通过100个经过验证的问题-回答对构建的模拟访谈，生成控制语言变体以隔离特定现象，同时保持语义等价。

Result: 结果显示，模糊语言回答的平均评分低25.6%，验证了基准测试在识别模型特定偏见方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究为检测和测量AI系统中的语言歧视提供了基础框架，对自动化决策中的公平性有广泛应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉-语言聚类的框架，用于更全面地评估视觉活动识别系统，解决了动词语义和图像解释的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于动词语义和图像解释的模糊性，传统的精确匹配评估方法无法全面评估模型性能，因此需要一种更鲁棒的评估方法。

Method: 提出了一种视觉-语言聚类框架，构建动词意义簇，以更全面地评估模型性能。

Result: 在imSitu数据集上，每张图像平均映射到2.8个意义簇，每个簇代表图像的不同视角。聚类评估比标准方法更符合人类判断。

Conclusion: 聚类评估方法能更全面地反映模型性能，且更符合人类判断，为视觉活动识别提供了更优的评估标准。

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解导致自杀事件的社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对早期干预和预防至关重要，但现有数据驱动方法面临长尾分布、关键压力源分析和模型可解释性不足等挑战。

Method: 采用多阶段大型语言模型框架，并与BioBERT、GPT-3.5-turbo和DeepSeek-R1等模型进行比较，同时评估模型解释对标注效率和准确性的影响。

Result: 提出的框架在SDoH因素提取和相关上下文检索任务中表现更优，且通过微调小模型实现了性能相当但推理成本更低的效果。多阶段设计还提升了模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了从非结构化文本中提取自杀相关SDoH的准确性和透明度，有助于早期风险识别和更有效的预防策略。

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设情感元素均匀分布，但实际对话中语义独立的子对话之间无明确依赖关系，跨对话学习会引入噪声。

Method: 使用结构熵最小化算法划分对话为语义独立子对话，采用两步框架（先提取情感元素，再匹配四元组）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在DiaASQ任务中达到最优性能，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 通过语义子对话划分和两步提取框架，有效提升了情感四元组提取的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

Motivation: 探索解码器架构LLM在AMR解析中的潜力，验证简单微调是否能媲美复杂SOTA方法。

Method: 微调四种LLM（Phi 3.5、Gemma 2、LLaMA 3.2、DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled），使用LDC2020T02测试集评估。

Result: LLaMA 3.2达到SMATCH F1: 0.804，与SOTA方法（如APT + Silver）相当，Phi 3.5在结构有效性上表现突出。

Conclusion: 简单微调解码器LLM可实现与复杂SOTA方法媲美的AMR解析性能，LLaMA 3.2和Phi 3.5各有优势。

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM
architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled
using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that
straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable
performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2
demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a
straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full
LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching
Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a

Motivation: 现有PEFT方法在多任务学习中倾向于使用复杂的多适配器或多头架构，但论文发现这种结构可能并非最优。

Method: 提出Align-LoRA，简化架构为单适配器并增加秩，同时引入对齐损失以增强共享表示。

Result: Align-LoRA性能显著优于基线，验证了共享表示的重要性。

Conclusion: 多任务学习中，学习鲁棒的共享表示比隔离任务特征更有效，Align-LoRA为此提供了更简单高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MultiCheck的多模态事实验证框架，通过结合文本和图像信号进行细粒度推理，显著提升了事实核查的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态错误信息（文本和图像结合）的增长对依赖文本证据的事实核查系统提出了挑战，需要更有效的多模态验证方法。

Method: 结合专用文本和图像编码器，通过融合模块捕捉跨模态关系，使用对比学习目标实现语义对齐。

Result: 在Factify 2数据集上加权F1得分为0.84，显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 显式多模态推理有效，MultiCheck框架在复杂场景中具有可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出BEE-RAG框架，通过熵不变性原理改进RAG系统对不同上下文长度的适应性，解决长检索上下文导致的熵增长和注意力稀释问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识局限性促使检索增强生成（RAG）的发展，但长检索上下文导致熵增长和注意力稀释，影响性能。

Method: 提出BEE-RAG框架，利用平衡上下文熵重构注意力动态，引入零样本推理策略和多重要性估计，以及参数高效的自适应微调机制。

Result: 在多个RAG任务上的实验验证了BEE-RAG的有效性。

Conclusion: BEE-RAG通过熵不变性显著提升RAG系统性能，适应不同上下文长度。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

Motivation: 探究LLMs对输入信息位置敏感的原因，并利用这一现象优化模型性能。

Method: 提出了Attention-Driven Reranking（AttnRank）框架，通过校准集估计模型的注意力偏好，并重新排序输入内容。

Result: 在多项任务中，AttnRank显著提升了10种不同架构和规模的LLMs的性能。

Conclusion: AttnRank是一种高效、无需训练的方法，能够显著提升LLMs的性能，适用于多种任务和模型。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA为诊断伦理弱点提供了可扩展框架，推动更平衡、负责任的医疗AI发展。

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Method: 采用“教师-助理-学生”蒸馏范式，先利用高性能多模态大模型生成初始推理数据集，训练中等规模的助理模型，再联合训练轻量级学生模型完成推理和分类。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，仅3B参数的MulCoT-RD在JMSRC任务上表现优异，具有强泛化能力和解释性。

Conclusion: MulCoT-RD为资源受限环境提供了高效的多模态情感推理和分类解决方案，兼具性能和轻量化。

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码LLM依赖人工标注指令进行后训练，但高质量指令收集成本高且难以扩展，而代码片段资源丰富。这种不平衡成为指令后训练的主要瓶颈。

Method: CodeBoost包含五个关键组件：最大团选择、双向预测、错误感知预测、异构增强和异构奖励。

Result: 实验表明，CodeBoost在多个代码LLM和基准测试中均能提升性能。

Conclusion: CodeBoost是一种可扩展且有效的训练框架，无需依赖人工标注指令。

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）推理链的可靠性，尤其是错误在推理链不同阶段的影响，以改进推理能力。

Method: 通过系统性错误注入实验验证“晚期脆弱性”，并提出ASCoT方法，包括自适应验证管理器（AVM）和多视角自校正引擎（MSCE）。

Result: ASCoT在GSM8K和MATH等基准测试中表现优异，优于标准CoT方法。

Conclusion: 诊断LLM推理的特定失败模式，并提倡采用自适应、针对脆弱性的校正机制。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting

through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster

Motivation: 解决LRLMs因反思行为导致的过度思考问题，即冗余推理步骤增加token使用和推理成本，降低实用性。

Method: 提出Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS)，动态抑制模型在高置信度时的反思触发词生成，无需重新训练或修改架构。

Result: 在四个推理基准测试中，CGRS平均减少18.5%至41.9%的token使用量，同时保持准确性，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: CGRS是一种高效、模型无关的方法，适用于不同架构和规模的LRLMs，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

Result: 用户偏好可调整设置，但未显著改善体验或可理解性；系统在功能和交互设计上存在不足。

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

Abstract: We present a collection of parallel corpora of 12 sign languages in video
format, together with subtitles in the dominant spoken languages of the
corresponding countries. The entire collection includes more than 1,300 hours
in 4,381 video files, accompanied by 1,3~M subtitles containing 14~M tokens.
Most notably, it includes the first consistent parallel corpora for 8 Latin
American sign languages, whereas the size of the German Sign Language corpora
is ten times the size of the previously available corpora. The collection was
created by collecting and processing videos of multiple sign languages from
various online sources, mainly broadcast material of news shows, governmental
bodies and educational channels. The preparation involved several stages,
including data collection, informing the content creators and seeking usage
approvals, scraping, and cropping. The paper provides statistics on the
collection and an overview of the methods used to collect the data.

TL;DR: MyCulture是一个评估大语言模型（LLMs）在马来西亚文化理解上的基准，涵盖六大文化支柱，采用开放式多选题形式以减少猜测和格式偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs因训练数据偏向高资源语言（如英语和中文）而表现出的文化偏见问题，特别是在低资源语言环境中。

Method: 设计MyCulture基准，包含六大文化支柱（艺术、服饰、习俗、娱乐、食物和宗教），使用开放式多选题形式，并分析结构和语言偏见。

Result: 评估显示不同LLMs在文化理解上存在显著差异，突显了开发文化基础和语言包容性基准的紧迫性。

Conclusion: MyCulture通过开放式结构和多语言评估，为LLMs的文化理解和公平性提供了更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMEval-3为评估LLMs的真实能力提供了可信的方法，推动了更可靠的评估标准的发展。

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

Motivation: 大语言模型在高层次语义任务上表现优异，但在需要精确控制的细粒度任务上存在不足，TASE旨在填补这一评估空白。

Method: TASE包含35,927个实例的评估集和可扩展的合成数据生成管道，涵盖中、英、韩三种语言，测试任务包括字符计数、令牌对齐等。

Conclusion: TASE为未来低层次语言理解和跨语言泛化的改进提供了新的诊断工具，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language
understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are

Motivation: 探讨不同创造力衡量指标的有效性和局限性，以改进创造力评估方法。

Method: 系统比较创造力指数、困惑度、句法模板和LLM-as-a-Judge在多个创意领域的表现。

Result: 指标一致性有限，各有不足，如创造力指数侧重词汇多样性，困惑度依赖模型信心，句法模板无法捕捉概念创意，LLM-as-a-Judge存在偏差。

Conclusion: 需开发更稳健、通用的评估框架，以更贴合人类对创造力的判断。

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型任务中易产生幻觉，现有检索增强生成方法在复杂推理场景中表现不足，缺乏结构化逻辑组织。

Method: LAG将复杂问题分解为原子子问题并按逻辑依赖排序，逐步解决并利用先前答案指导后续检索，引入逻辑终止机制防止错误传播。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，LAG显著提升推理鲁棒性、减少幻觉，并与人类认知对齐。

Conclusion: LAG为现有检索增强生成系统提供了一种原则性替代方案，增强了模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在主动提问时是否表现出隐含的地理和文化偏见，而非通过传统提问方式触发模型的防御机制。

Method: 使用20 Questions游戏作为测试平台，评估LLMs在多种语言和配置下的表现，并分析地理和文化差异。

Result: LLMs在全球北方和西方的实体推断能力显著优于全球南方和东方，且语言对性能差异影响较小。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs中隐含的地理和文化偏见，强调了自由形式评估框架的价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at
https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在法律领域生成不忠实或幻觉输出的问题，提升文本生成的可靠性。

Method: 引入Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding (CoCoLex)，根据模型置信度动态调整复制行为。

Result: 在五个法律基准测试中，CoCoLex优于现有方法，尤其在长文本生成任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: CoCoLex通过增强上下文的忠实度，为法律文本生成提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多选题问答中表现优异，但其不可靠性（如幻觉和过度自信）限制了在高风险领域的应用。

Method: 采用频率不确定性量化方法，利用共形预测确保覆盖率保证，通过多次独立采样计算预测熵。

Result: 在六个大型语言模型和四个数据集上的实验表明，频率预测熵优于基于logit的预测熵，并能有效控制误覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该方法为多选题问答提供了一个分布无关、模型无关的可靠不确定性量化框架，增强了大型语言模型在实际应用中的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

Motivation: 探讨跨文化政治意见差异是否在多语言大语言模型中表现为跨语言差异。

Method: 通过提示MLLMs报告对政治声明的（不）同意，评估其意见；并在对齐前后分析语言间互动。

Result: 未对齐模型的政治意见跨语言差异极少；对齐后意见在五种语言中几乎一致变化。

Conclusion: 在西方语言背景下，政治意见在语言间传递，突显了MLLMs实现社会语言、文化和政治对齐的挑战。

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

Method: MathSmith从PlanetMath随机采样概念-解释对生成新问题，采用九种策略增加难度，并通过强化学习优化问题结构、推理复杂性和答案一致性。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，MathSmith在短链和长链推理设置下均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: MathSmith展示了高难度合成数据在提升语言模型推理能力方面的潜力，具有强扩展性、泛化性和迁移性。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Result: Cooper缓解了奖励攻击，提升RL性能，如在Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct上平均准确率提升0.54%。

Conclusion: 动态更新奖励模型是解决奖励攻击的有效方法，为RL中更好整合奖励模型提供参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

Method: 通过文本环境表示建模连续物理属性和复杂空间关系，涵盖1,500个家庭和工业场景，系统评估模型性能。

Result: 模型在显式指令下表现良好（85-96%成功率），但在工具推理（56-85%）和隐式协作（63-85%）中性能下降，多任务失败率超50%。微调对单智能体任务提升显著（0.6%至76.3%），但对多智能体任务效果有限（1.5%至5.5%）。

Conclusion: 具身推理对现有模型构成根本性挑战，OmniEAR为评估和推进具身AI系统提供了严格基准。

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 新奖励函数有效提升了模型的事实推理能力，解决了奖励滥用问题，同时保持了回答的实用性。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

*Mehrdad Zakershahrak,Samira Ghodratnama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: H-NET++是一种分层动态分块模型，通过端到端训练学习语言感知的分割，解决了字节级语言模型在形态丰富语言中的计算挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 字节级语言模型在形态丰富语言（MRLs）中面临计算挑战，因为单词可能跨越多个字节。H-NET++旨在提供一种无需显式分词器的解决方案。

Method: H-NET++采用分层动态分块，包括轻量级Transformer上下文混合器、两级潜在超先验、专门处理拼写伪影（如波斯语ZWNJ）以及基于课程的分阶段训练。

Result: 在1.4B标记的波斯语语料库上，H-NET++实现了最先进的结果：比BPE-based GPT-2-fa压缩率提高12%，ParsGLUE性能提升5.4pp，对ZWNJ损坏的鲁棒性提高53%，形态边界F1得分为73.8%。

Conclusion: H-NET++证明了分层动态分块是一种有效的无分词器解决方案，适用于形态丰富语言，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinexDual是一种基于Retinex理论的新型框架，用于超高清图像修复任务，通过两个互补子网络（SAMBA和FIA）分别处理反射和光照问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如下采样或频域转换）在超高清图像修复中存在信息丢失或局部退化问题，RetinexDual旨在克服这些限制。

Method: RetinexDual包含两个子网络：SAMBA（通过粗到细机制修复反射）和FIA（在频域中校正光照和颜色）。

Result: 在四种超高清图像修复任务中，RetinexDual在质量和量化指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RetinexDual通过独特设计和互补子网络，有效解决了超高清图像修复中的关键问题。

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开基准在ENT内窥镜分析中缺乏对分类和病例检索的支持，尤其是视觉和文本描述的结合。

Method: 提出ENTRep数据集，包含专家标注的图像和双语描述，并定义了三个基准任务，采用服务器端评分。

Result: 报告了表现最佳团队的结果，并提供了深入讨论。

Conclusion: ENTRep为ENT内窥镜分析提供了全面的基准，支持多任务和多语言需求。

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

TL;DR: CoMAD是一种轻量级、无参数的框架，通过多教师蒸馏统一自监督视觉Transformer的知识，提升紧凑学生网络的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自监督学习方法孤立预训练、忽略互补知识且模型过大不适用于资源受限场景的问题。

Method: 采用非对称掩码策略，学生仅看到25%的补丁，教师接收不同掩码，通过线性适配器和层归一化对齐教师嵌入，并使用联合共识门控融合知识。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上达到75.4% Top-1准确率，密集预测任务中表现优异，刷新紧凑自监督蒸馏的SOTA。

Conclusion: CoMAD通过多教师蒸馏和共识机制，显著提升了紧凑模型的性能，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于扩散模型的异常检测方法存在计算成本高、重建质量不稳定和噪声选择依赖先验知识的问题，RADAR旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: RADAR直接通过扩散模型生成异常图，避免了耗时的重建过程，提高了检测效率和准确性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和3D打印材料数据集上，RADAR在准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数上均优于现有方法，F1分数分别提高了7%和13%。

Conclusion: RADAR通过无重建方法显著提升了异常检测的性能和效率，为实时应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

Motivation: 眼球快速运动（可达300度/秒）的精确追踪通常需要昂贵的高速相机，研究旨在开发低成本且高效的算法，应用于消费电子领域（如VR/AR）。

Method: 采用深度学习技术，探索多种方法，最终CNN_LSTM模型表现最佳。

Result: CNN_LSTM模型在眼球中心定位任务中达到约81%的准确率。

Conclusion: 研究成功开发了低成本的眼球追踪算法，未来将通过LRP进一步提升模型性能。

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

TL;DR: LuKAN模型结合Kolmogorov-Arnold网络和Lucas多项式激活函数，通过离散小波变换和空间投影层实现高效且准确的3D人体运动预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测精度和计算效率之间难以平衡，需要一种更高效的模型。

Method: 使用离散小波变换编码时间信息，空间投影层捕捉关节依赖关系，KAN层结合Lucas多项式进行高效函数逼近。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，计算效率高。

Conclusion: LuKAN在预测精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

TL;DR: VER-Bench是一个新框架，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在识别细粒度视觉线索和结合世界知识进行复杂推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在评估MLLMs的视觉能力时存在不足，无法全面测试对细微局部细节的深度理解和复杂推理能力。

Method: 提出VER-Bench框架，包含374个精心设计的问题，覆盖多种推理类型，每个问题附带结构化证据（视觉线索和相关推理）。

Result: VER-Bench揭示了现有模型在提取细微视觉证据和构建基于证据的论证方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 需要增强模型在细粒度视觉证据提取、整合和推理方面的能力，以实现真正的视觉理解和类人分析。

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

Result: 在四个基准测试中，DAMM在平均精度（AP）和召回率上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 多模态查询适应和双流注意力机制有效提升了目标检测的精度和效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

Conclusion: 研究强调了时间感知模型和基准的必要性，以提高多模态仇恨视频检测的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

Motivation: 现有视频高光检测方法因使用固定模型而无法适应不同测试视频的多样性，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Highlight-TTA框架，结合主任务（高光检测）和辅助任务（跨模态幻觉），采用元辅助训练方案，在测试时通过辅助任务动态调整模型。

Result: 实验表明，Highlight-TTA显著提升了三种先进高光检测模型在三个基准数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA通过测试时自适应有效解决了现有方法的泛化问题，提升了高光检测性能。

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

Method: 引入校准令牌作为轻量级适配机制，调整潜在嵌入分布，利用自监督学习，无需鱼眼图像数据。

Result: 在室内外场景中，使用单一令牌集显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了FMDEs在鱼眼图像上的分布偏移问题，具有实用性和泛化性。

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

TL;DR: ProMIM是一个轻量级框架，通过结合掩码图像建模（MIM）增强现有视觉语言模型的提示学习，提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法（如CoOp和CoCoOp）在适应新任务时容易过拟合已知类别，限制了泛化能力。

Method: ProMIM利用掩码策略生成实例条件提示，增强特征鲁棒性，同时保持计算成本低。

Result: 实验表明，ProMIM能显著提升零样本和小样本分类任务的泛化性能。

Conclusion: ProMIM为视觉语言应用提供了一种高效、轻量的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自监督学习在领域偏移（如生物医学图像中的批次效应）下的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 在DINOv2架构中引入梯度反转层，实现对抗性领域不变特征学习。

Result: 在非小细胞肺癌的多通道免疫荧光图像上，AdvDINO减少了批次偏差，发现了具有预后意义的表型簇，并提升了生存预测性能。

Conclusion: AdvDINO在领域偏移和标注数据有限的情况下，提升了模型的泛化能力和可解释性，适用于多种图像领域。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖资源密集型离线增量学习或密集标注支持数据的局限性。

Method: 构建查询数据的类原型，利用稀疏人类标注指导分割，引入层次化原型消歧机制和密集条件随机场优化标签分配。

Result: 在稀疏标注（如每新类一次点击）下，HOW-Seg性能与5-shot GFS-Seg相当或更好；使用高级骨干和密集标注时，在S3DIS和ScanNetv2上分别达到85.27%和66.37% mIoU。

Conclusion: HOW-Seg通过动态人类反馈显著提升了开放世界点云分割的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

Result: 在稀疏视角3D合成中表现优异，PSNR提升3.27%（MipNeRF 360数据集）。

Conclusion: 自适应权重和不确定性学习显著提升了3DGS在稀疏视角下的渲染质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

Result: 实验表明，改进方法在质量/成本权衡上表现更好，提高了mAP和召回率。

Conclusion: 可变画布尺寸和可选帧率能有效提升实时感知性能，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

Motivation: 传统扩散图像压缩方法存在解码延迟高和保真度低的缺点，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 利用预训练VAE生成信息丰富的潜在表示，替换多步去噪为单步解码，引入保真度引导模块和速率退火训练策略。

Result: SODEC在率失真感知性能上显著优于现有方法，解码速度提升超过20倍。

Conclusion: SODEC通过单步解码和保真度优化，显著提升了扩散图像压缩的性能和效率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度补全模型在分布外（OOD）场景中性能显著下降，而基础模型在大规模训练中表现出色，因此探索如何利用基础模型提升深度补全的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过深度基础模型从RGB图像中提取环境线索（结构和语义上下文），设计无参数的双空间传播方法（3D和2D空间），并引入可学习的校正模块逐步调整预测深度。

Result: 在NYUv2和KITTI数据集上训练，并在16个其他数据集上评估，模型在OOD场景中表现优异，优于现有深度补全方法。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了深度补全的鲁棒性，无需依赖大规模训练，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

Result: 在多种实验设置下，性能提升高达9%，计算效率提升9倍。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了模态差距问题，显著提升了无监督域适应的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

Motivation: 探索早期视觉皮层如何快速学习全局图像上下文，以及快速权重在其中的作用。

Method: 采用ViT自编码器和LoRA技术，分析熟悉性训练对神经网络早期层的影响。

Result: 熟悉性训练使早期层对全局上下文敏感，LoRA显著增强这一效果。

Conclusion: 快速权重架构为研究大脑快速学习全局上下文提供了可行模型。

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在遮挡场景下因忽视细粒度属性信息而表现不佳，需改进以处理部分遮挡和细微外观差异。

Method: 提出AG-ReID框架：首先生成属性伪标签捕捉细微特征，再通过双引导机制结合整体和细粒度信息增强特征提取。

Result: 在多个Re-ID数据集上取得SOTA结果，显著提升遮挡和细微差异处理能力，同时在标准场景保持竞争力。

Conclusion: AG-ReID通过利用预训练模型的细粒度属性提取能力，有效解决了遮挡和细微差异问题，为Re-ID任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CRAM的视频持续学习方法，通过压缩视频数据减少存储需求，并解决了视频压缩器的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频持续学习面临高存储需求和灾难性遗忘的挑战，需要一种高效且自适应的解决方案。

Method: 使用压缩视觉技术存储视频编码而非原始数据，并通过刷新视频编码解决压缩器的遗忘问题。

Result: 在EpicKitchens-100和Kinetics-700等大规模数据集上，CRAM方法显著优于现有技术，且存储需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: CRAM方法为视频持续学习提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，显著降低了存储需求并提升了性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

Result: MCDRL在实验中表现优于其他方法，分割准确性和泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: MCDRL通过因果驱动方法有效解决了医学图像分割中的领域泛化问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

Result: 论文提供了对现有方法在评估AI-UGC感知质量方面的全面分析。

Conclusion: AU-IQA数据集填补了AI-UGC质量评估的空白，为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症，早期诊断和准确治疗对提高患者生存率至关重要。手动生成SOAP笔记耗时且易导致临床医生疲劳。

Method: 使用弱监督多模态框架，结合病变图像和稀疏临床文本生成SOAP笔记，减少对大量标注数据的需求。

Result: 性能与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro相当，并引入了MedConceptEval和CCS两个新指标评估临床相关性。

Conclusion: skin-SOAP框架能够减轻临床医生负担，实现可扩展的临床文档生成。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

Conclusion: SCSSIM在结构评估上优于现有指标，是生成模型开发和评估的有力工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HAMoBE的新框架，通过分层和自适应混合生物特征专家，显著提升了视频行人重识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频行人重识别方法忽略了从查询-图库对中选择最具区分性特征的必要性，导致匹配效果不佳。

Method: HAMoBE框架利用预训练大模型的多层特征，独立建模关键生物特征（外观、静态体型、动态步态），并通过双输入决策门控网络动态整合专家贡献。

Result: 在MEVID等基准测试中，性能显著提升（如Rank-1准确率提高13.0%）。

Conclusion: HAMoBE通过自适应特征选择和整合，为视频行人重识别提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在复杂文档中处理细粒度细节的能力尚未充分研究，需要一种方法来评估和改进这种能力。

Method: 引入NiM基准测试，并提出Spot-IT方法，通过智能补丁选择和高斯注意力增强MLLMs的能力。

Result: 实验表明Spot-IT在复杂布局中提取精确细节方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Spot-IT有效提升了MLLMs处理细粒度文档理解任务的能力，揭示了当前模型的局限性和潜力。

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂光照条件下估计PBR材料时表现不佳，尤其是在高分辨率和多视角输入下。DualMat旨在解决这些问题，提升材料估计的准确性和效率。

Method: DualMat采用双路径设计：一条路径在RGB潜在空间中优化反照率，另一条路径在紧凑潜在空间中精确估计金属性和粗糙度。通过特征蒸馏和整流流技术提高效率和一致性。

Result: DualMat在Objaverse和真实数据上实现了最先进的性能，反照率估计提升28%，金属性-粗糙度预测误差降低39%。

Conclusion: DualMat通过双路径设计和特征蒸馏，显著提升了PBR材料估计的准确性和效率，适用于高分辨率和多视角输入。

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

Motivation: 现有CSS方法通常采用单阶段编码器-解码器架构，导致新旧类别学习干扰和保留-可塑性平衡不佳。

Result: 该方法在多种挑战性任务中实现了最先进的性能，平衡了保留与适应性。

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS通过解耦检测与分割，有效解决了CSS中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于分类和对抗学习的图像着色方法，旨在解决传统回归方法的局限性。

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GAN和扩散模型方法依赖额外控制模块或算法，可能引入误差，导致迁移效果不佳。

Method: 基于FLUX-Kontext框架，引入RefLoRAInjector轻量级特征注入器，并设计高效数据生成流程。

Result: FLUX-Makeup在实验中表现最佳，鲁棒性强，生成的数据集质量显著优于现有数据集。

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup无需辅助组件即可实现高性能妆容迁移，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

Result: 在三个真实基准测试中，AdaFusion在分类和回归任务中均优于单个PFMs，并提供模型生物语义特化的可解释性。

Conclusion: AdaFusion能够整合异构PFMs，提升性能并增强模型特定归纳偏差的可解释性。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

TL;DR: PoseGen是一个新框架，通过单张参考图像和驱动姿态序列生成任意长度的视频，解决了扩散模型在身份漂移和短片段限制上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在生成长视频时存在身份漂移和片段限制的问题，PoseGen旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 采用上下文LoRA微调策略，在token级别注入主题外观以保持身份，同时在通道级别条件化姿态信息以控制运动。通过分段生成和共享KV缓存机制确保背景一致性和时间平滑性。

Result: 在33小时的小规模视频数据集上训练，PoseGen在身份保真度、姿态准确性和生成无限时长视频方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PoseGen通过创新的微调和分段生成方法，实现了高质量、长时长的视频生成，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

<details>

Motivation: 现实应用中数据隐私和获取成本高，导致增量任务中训练数据不足，性能下降。现有方法难以平衡基类区分性和新类泛化性。

Method: SMP结合了Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging（MIAM）机制和Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration（MPCC）策略，优化基类学习与增量任务决策边界。

Result: 在CIFAR100、ImageNet-R和CUB200上的实验表明，SMP在FSCIL中达到最先进性能，并更好地平衡基类和新类。

Conclusion: SMP通过策略性整合边际惩罚，显著提升了FSCIL的性能和平衡性。

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多实例学习在病理图像分类中因处理高分辨率图像导致的高计算成本问题。

Method: 提出AHDMIL框架，包含DMIN和DB-LIPN网络，通过自蒸馏和非对称蒸馏两步训练筛选无关图像块。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，分类性能和推理速度均有显著提升。

Conclusion: AHDMIL为病理图像分类提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

Conclusion: 通过多潜在表达和视觉细节的结合，显著提升了视觉定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将人类和动物运动分开建模，而跨物种联合方法能提供统一表示和更好的泛化能力，但形态差异仍是挑战。

Result: 在UniMo4D数据集上，X-MoGen在可见和未见物种上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: X-MoGen首次实现了跨物种文本驱动运动生成的统一框架，解决了形态差异问题，并展示了优越性能。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

Conclusion: PhysPatch为MLLM系统提供了高效且物理可实现的对抗攻击方案，具有现实部署潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

Conclusion: MTT框架通过轨迹片段增强和灵活关联，有效提升了未见类别目标的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: SPA++通过谱对齐和一致性正则化，显著提升了域适应的性能，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: SPEX是首个专注于光谱遥感图像土地覆盖提取的多模态视觉语言模型，显著提升了性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

TL;DR: EndoMatcher通过大规模多域数据预训练解决了内窥镜图像匹配中的视觉条件和数据稀缺问题，显著提升了匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像中的通用密集特征匹配对机器人辅助任务至关重要，但由于视觉条件复杂和标注数据稀缺，现有方法难以应对。

Method: 提出EndoMatcher，采用双分支Vision Transformer提取多尺度特征，并构建Endo-Mix6多域数据集，通过渐进式多目标训练策略提升泛化能力。

Result: 在零样本实验中，EndoMatcher在Hamlyn和Bladder数据集上分别提升内点匹配数140.69%和201.43%，在Gastro-Matching数据集上MDPA提升9.40%。

Conclusion: EndoMatcher通过创新方法和数据集设计，显著提升了内窥镜图像匹配的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

Method: 提出VFlowOpt框架，包括重要性映射生成、渐进修剪模块和视觉信息流引导的修剪策略优化。

Result: 实验表明，VFlowOpt可修剪90%的视觉令牌，保持性能，减少89%的KV-Cache内存，推理速度提升3.8倍。

Conclusion: VFlowOpt为LMMs提供了一种高效的令牌修剪方法，显著降低计算成本且性能损失小。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨域少样本分割的挑战，无需源域数据，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性，并发布了数据集TNLLT。

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack通过推理和语言生成优化，显著提升了视觉语言跟踪性能。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

Conclusion: 现代视觉基础模型在复杂气泡分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Result: 框架仅需多相机图像及其位姿即可训练，无需额外传感器或深度图，首次实现多车辆配置下的可控任意视角图像生成。

Conclusion: Arbiviewgen为自动驾驶中的任意视角图像生成提供了高效且无需额外数据的解决方案。

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

Abstract: This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial

two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies
model parameters, and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, which preserve them. We
trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding
space re-engineering (LAAT, TIMA), and from input heuristics (AOM, TTC) to
latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and
future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial

Result: 实验显示，MELLA显著提升了八种语言的性能，模型生成更丰富的描述。

Conclusion: MELLA通过增强文化知识和语言能力，有效提升了低资源语言环境下的MLLM性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

TL;DR: RegionMed-CLIP是一个区域感知的多模态对比学习框架，通过结合局部病理信号和全局语义表示，解决了医学图像理解中数据标注不足和全局特征依赖的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像理解面临高质量标注数据稀缺和全局特征忽略重要病理区域的挑战。

Method: 提出RegionMed-CLIP框架，包含自适应ROI处理器和渐进式训练策略，结合MedRegion-500k数据集进行区域级表示学习。

Result: 在图像-文本检索、零样本分类和视觉问答任务中，RegionMed-CLIP显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 区域感知对比预训练对医学图像理解至关重要，RegionMed-CLIP为多模态医学图像分析提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

TL;DR: Uni-CoT是一个统一的链式思维框架，通过结合图像理解和生成能力，实现了连贯的多模态推理，并在计算效率和性能上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在视觉语言推理任务中因视觉状态转换能力有限或架构碎片化导致的推理不连贯问题。

Method: 提出两层次推理范式：宏观层次的任务规划和微观层次的子任务执行，结合图像-文本监督和多任务目标进行训练。

Result: 在WISE、RISE和KRIS基准测试中表现优异，计算效率高（仅需8块A100 GPU）。

Conclusion: Uni-CoT为多模态推理提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

Result: 总结了现有方法的优缺点，并指出了研究中的空白和挑战。

Conclusion: 论文为研究者提供了性别分类领域的知识，并提出了未来改进的建议和路径。

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

TL;DR: 论文提出GUI-RC和GUI-RCPO方法，通过空间投票和自监督优化提升GUI定位任务的表现，无需额外训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI定位方法依赖高成本像素级标注，限制了其应用。观察到模型预测的空间重叠模式隐含置信度信号，可用于更精准定位。

Method: GUI-RC通过空间投票网格识别共识区域；GUI-RCPO将一致性模式转化为奖励，用于推理时的自监督优化。

Result: GUI-RC将Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct在ScreenSpot-v2上的准确率从80.11%提升至83.57%，GUI-RCPO进一步优化至85.14%。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了测试时缩放和强化学习在GUI定位中的潜力，为更鲁棒、高效的数据利用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CF3的3D高斯特征场构建方法，通过自上而下的流程优化计算效率，减少高斯数量至5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖自下而上的优化过程，计算成本高，且将2D特征视为绝对真理。

Method: 采用多视角2D特征的加权融合，训练高斯自编码器，并引入自适应稀疏化方法优化高斯属性。

Result: CF3方法仅需5%的高斯数量即可实现与Feature-3DGS竞争的性能。

Conclusion: CF3提供了一种高效且紧凑的3D特征场表示方法，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGDFuse利用Segment Anything Model（SAM）生成的语义掩码作为显式先验，通过条件扩散模型实现高保真和语义感知的红外与可见光图像融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因缺乏对场景的深层语义理解，常导致关键目标丢失，且融合过程可能引入伪影和细节损失。

Method: 采用两阶段过程：先初步融合多模态特征，再结合SAM的语义掩码作为条件，驱动扩散模型进行粗到细的去噪生成。

Result: SGDFuse在主观和客观评估中均达到最优性能，且对下游任务适应性强。

Conclusion: SGDFuse为图像融合的核心挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

Result: 提供统一解决方案，支持动态户外环境的时空推理。

Conclusion: B4DL为4D LiDAR在MLLM中的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in
dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated
dataset, and inference outputs on diverse scenarios at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小波变换的双频编码方法（WGDF），通过频域特征建模提升遥感图像中细微变化的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖空间域建模，特征表示多样性有限，难以检测细微变化区域。频域特征建模（如小波域）可以放大频率分量的差异，增强边缘变化的感知。

Method: 使用离散小波变换（DWT）分解图像为高频和低频成分，分别建模局部细节和全局结构。高频分支设计了双频特征增强模块（DFFE）和频域交互差异模块（FDID）；低频分支利用Transformer捕获全局语义关系，并采用渐进上下文差异模块（PCDM）逐步优化变化区域。最终融合高频和低频特征。

Result: 在多个遥感数据集上的实验表明，WGDF显著减轻了边缘模糊问题，检测精度和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WGDF通过频域特征建模和双频编码，有效提升了遥感图像变化检测的性能。

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/boshizhang123/WGDF.

Motivation: 传统PPAT草图分析依赖心理学家经验且耗时，需要一种自动化方法来支持大规模评估。

Method: 提出了VS-LLM方法，结合视觉和语义分析，自动化评估PPAT草图。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法比心理学家评估方法提升了17.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于PPAT草图的心理状态评估提供了高效工具，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

Result: CoCAViT-28M在ImageNet-1K上达到84.0% top-1准确率，在多个OOD基准测试中表现优异，同时保持低延迟。

Conclusion: CoCAViT在小型模型中实现了高效的泛化性能，适用于实时视觉任务。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic
segmentation, while maintaining low latency.

Conclusion: mKG-RAG通过引入结构化多模态知识，有效提升了知识密集型VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练的视觉语言模型在目标检测任务中表现优异，但在特定目标上仍需微调，而这通常会导致模型失去原有的自然语言查询和零样本能力。

Method: 受文本反转在个性化文本到图像扩散模型中成功的启发，作者提出了一种类似的方法，通过学习和改进令牌来扩展VLM的词汇表，仅需少量示例即可检测新对象。

Result: 该方法在保持原始模型性能的同时，显著减少了计算需求，并在多种定量和定性实验中验证了其优于基线方法的表现。

Conclusion: 该方法为开放词汇目标检测提供了一种高效且兼容的解决方案，同时保留了模型的零样本能力。

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Motivation: 3DGS因使用高斯函数而难以捕捉高频细节，且存在冗余基元和内存效率低的问题。

Method: 提出3D Gabor基元，结合多方向3D频率响应，并开发CUDA光栅化器和频率自适应机制。

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat是一种高效且高质量的3D场景表示方法，可无缝集成到现有3DGS框架中。

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

TL;DR: PriorRG是一个新的胸部X光报告生成框架，通过两阶段训练流程有效利用患者特定先验知识，提升报告的临床准确性和流畅性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常忽略患者的临床背景和先验图像信息，导致无法准确捕捉诊断意图或疾病进展。PriorRG旨在模拟真实临床工作流程，填补这一空白。

Method: PriorRG采用两阶段训练：1）先验引导的对比预训练，利用临床背景指导时空特征提取；2）先验感知的粗到细解码，逐步整合患者特定先验知识与视觉编码器隐藏状态。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和MIMIC-ABN数据集上，PriorRG表现优于现有方法，BLEU-4和F1分数分别提升3.6%和3.8%，BLEU-1提升5.9%。

Conclusion: PriorRG通过有效整合先验知识，显著提升了胸部X光报告生成的临床准确性和流畅性。

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

*Yongjun Zhang,Mingtao Xiong,Yi Wan,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Slice-Loc提出了一种两阶段的跨视角定位方法，通过分割查询图像为子图像生成冗余观测，并利用几何刚性公式和NFA模型验证定位可靠性，显著提升了定位精度和失败检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角定位方法通常仅输出单一相机位姿，缺乏冗余观测，难以验证定位可靠性。

Method: Slice-Loc将查询图像分割为子图像，估计每个子图像的3-DoF位姿，通过几何刚性公式过滤错误位姿，并利用NFA模型量化定位可靠性。

Result: Slice-Loc将超过10米的定位误差比例降至3%以下，在DReSS数据集上，平均定位误差从4.47米降至1.86米，平均方向误差从3.42°降至1.24°。

Conclusion: Slice-Loc通过冗余观测和可靠性验证，显著提升了跨视角定位的精度和鲁棒性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要依赖全局图像特征，忽略了细粒度器官关系对准确报告的重要性，因此需要一种能显式建模放射学知识的方法。

Method: 提出CT-GRAPH，利用解剖掩码获取全局和器官级特征，通过图注意力网络细化特征，并集成到大型语言模型中生成报告。

Result: 在CT-RATE数据集上，F1分数比现有方法绝对提升7.9%。

Conclusion: CT-GRAPH通过显式建模解剖层次关系，显著提升了放射学报告的生成性能。

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有MIL方法难以捕捉组织结构的空间依赖性，传统GNN依赖静态图拓扑，且注意力机制缺乏特异性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能，验证了可变形注意力在复杂空间结构中的有效性。

Conclusion: 可变形注意力机制显著提升了病理图像分析的性能，尤其在捕捉空间结构方面表现突出。

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UNCAGE的无训练方法，通过利用注意力图优先解掩代表单个对象的标记，从而提升文本到图像生成的组合保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于掩码生成变换器的文本到图像生成方法在组合保真度和文本-图像对齐方面存在局限性，而扩散模型虽已广泛研究此问题，但掩码生成变换器尚未被探索。

Method: 提出UNCAGE方法，利用注意力图优先解掩代表单个对象的标记，无需额外训练。

Result: UNCAGE在多个基准和指标上均显著提升了性能，且推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: UNCAGE是一种高效且无需训练的方法，显著提升了组合文本到图像生成的保真度。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有的后门攻击防御机制在识别和修复被投毒图像时面临挑战，可能影响数据效用。TrueBiometric旨在提供更准确、实用的解决方案。

Method: 利用多个先进的视觉语言模型进行多数投票检测被投毒图像，并通过校准的校正噪声修复这些图像。

Conclusion: TrueBiometric为后门攻击防御提供了更高效、准确的解决方案，提升了人脸识别系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

Motivation: 物理对抗性伪装对自动驾驶等安全关键领域构成威胁，现有方法在多变物理环境中面临梯度优化不稳定和攻击效果不佳的挑战。

Method: 引入梯度校准策略确保梯度更新的一致性，开发梯度去相关方法优化多角度梯度更新。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了对抗性伪装的效果，同时强调了现实场景中系统设计的鲁棒性需求。

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动查询缺乏样本特定信息，影响图像或视频首帧的精确聚合；非首帧查询已具备样本信息，需不同处理方式。

Method: （1）预热冷启动查询，利用输入特征的丰富信息；（2）区分首帧和非首帧的处理，分别采用完整和单次迭代。

Result: 在对象发现、识别及下游任务中表现优异，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SmoothSA通过优化SA的迭代和递归过程，显著提升了对象中心学习的性能。

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的显著性图方法仅捕捉一阶归因，忽略了视觉-语言编码器中复杂的跨模态交互，因此需要一种更灵活且高效的解释方法。

Method: FIxLIP基于博弈论中的加权Banzhaf交互指数，提供了一种统一的方法来分解相似性，并扩展了解释评估指标。

Result: 在MS COCO和ImageNet-1k基准测试中，FIxLIP表现优于一阶归因方法，并成功用于比较不同模型。

Conclusion: FIxLIP不仅提供了高质量的解释，还能有效比较不同模型，展示了其在视觉-语言预训练模型中的实用价值。

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

Motivation: 传统基于流的方法在模型表达能力上存在限制，无法有效处理高维空间中的异常检测问题。

Method: 提出时间反转FM（rFM）和Worst Transport（WT）位移插值方法，构建非概率演化路径，增强对样本轨迹的动态控制。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上实现了单尺度的最优性能，证明了FM在无监督异常检测任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: FM为无监督异常检测提供了理论支持的计算框架，WT-Flow通过动态控制样本轨迹实现了异常样本的有效分离。

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

Conclusion: F2PASeg和PAS数据集为垂体手术的解剖结构分割提供了有效工具，增强了手术安全性。

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

Motivation: 探讨压缩模型对对抗性攻击的防御效果，特别是高真实感重建图像对攻击难度的影响。

Method: 构建白盒和自适应攻击，评估多种压缩模型在不同攻击场景下的表现。

Result: 高真实感重建的压缩模型对攻击更具抵抗力，而低真实感模型易被攻破。真实感重建与自然图像的分布对齐提供固有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 高真实感重建是抵御对抗性攻击的关键，未来攻击技术需克服这一挑战以进行更全面的安全评估。

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

Motivation: 历史地图缺乏现代图像中的一致性模式，导致预训练基础模型难以直接应用。

Result: SMOL-MapSeg能准确分割OND知识定义的类别，并可通过少样本微调适应新类别，性能优于UNet基线。

Conclusion: OND知识提示方法有效提升了历史地图分割的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality

collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a

We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

*Weikang Wang,Tobias Weißberg,Nafie El Amrani,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督的手性特征提取方法，用于增强形状顶点的手性信息，并在多个下游任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手性信息在形状分析中普遍存在，但现有形状描述符缺乏手性感知能力，亟需开发手性特征提取器。

Method: 基于Diff3F框架，提出无监督的手性特征提取流程，利用2D基础模型提取手性感知信息。

Result: 在左-右解耦、形状匹配和部分分割等任务中，提取的手性特征表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了形状分析中手性信息不足的问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

*Shibo Wang,Haonan He,Maria Parelli,Christoph Gebhardt,Zicong Fan,Jie Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagicHOI提出了一种从单目视频中重建手和物体的方法，解决了传统方法因视角限制导致的物体部分不可见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB手物体重建方法依赖物体模板或假设完全可见，但在实际场景中因固定视角和静态抓握导致部分物体不可见，重建效果不理想。

Method: MagicHOI利用大规模新视角合成扩散模型提供物体监督，通过新视角合成模型和可见接触约束对齐手与物体。

Result: MagicHOI显著优于现有方法，新视角合成扩散先验有效规范了不可见物体区域。

Conclusion: MagicHOI通过结合新视角合成模型和接触约束，提升了手物体重建效果，尤其在视角受限场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督预训练框架，用于从稀疏且嘈杂的事件数据中提取边缘信息和纹理线索，通过三个阶段（差异引导掩码建模、主干固定的特征转换和聚焦对比学习）提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机数据具有高时间分辨率和宽动态范围，但数据稀疏且噪声多，难以有效提取特征，需开发新方法以揭示其潜在信息。

Method: 框架包括差异引导掩码建模（重建时间强度差异图）、主干固定的特征转换（对比事件和图像特征）和聚焦对比学习（更新模型以提高语义区分）。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在对象识别、语义分割和光流估计等任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督预训练框架能有效提取事件数据中的信息，提升下游任务性能，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/EventPretrain.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增强的视觉行人跟踪框架，通过结合更丰富的特征表示和鲁棒的运动模型，解决了严重遮挡场景下的跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，行人遮挡问题严重影响了跟踪器的稳定性，传统方法在遮挡场景下表现不佳。

Method: 结合检测器的回归和分类分支特征，引入头部关键点检测模型，并提出迭代卡尔曼滤波方法。

Result: 提出的方法在遮挡严重的拥挤环境中表现出更鲁棒的跟踪性能。

Conclusion: 通过改进外观和运动建模，该方法为复杂场景下的多目标跟踪提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于特征空间随机平滑的新型图像质量评估（IQA）模型认证防御方法，相比直接在输入空间添加噪声的方法，保留了图像质量并提供鲁棒性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在输入图像中直接注入高斯噪声会降低视觉质量，而新方法通过在特征空间添加噪声，避免了这一问题。

Method: 通过分析主干网络雅可比矩阵的最大奇异值，将特征空间噪声与输入空间扰动关联，支持全参考和无参考IQA模型，无需修改架构。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持图像质量的同时，推理时间减少了99.5%（无认证）和20.6%（有认证），与主观质量分数的相关性提升高达30.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和性能上均优于现有认证防御方法，适用于多种IQA场景。

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

Method: 引入Jacobian Criterion评估参数重要性，并提出Equivalent Pruning机制，通过自编码器保留原始连接的作用。

Result: Jacobian Criterion在保留模型性能上优于其他方法，Equivalent Pruning有效减少了微调后的性能下降。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在结构剪枝中表现优异，兼顾了参数间联系和性能保持。

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

Result: 在多种基准数据集上，SSTGNN在域内和跨域场景中表现优异，且参数比现有最优模型少42.4倍。

Conclusion: SSTGNN是一种高效、轻量且可扩展的解决方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

Method: 引入了一个新的多模态多语言数据集，并通过比较分析评估了MLLMs（如Gemini、GPT和Llama）在品牌安全分类中的表现。

Result: 研究表明MLLMs在品牌安全分类中具有较高的准确性和成本效率，但也存在局限性。

Conclusion: 论文强调了MLLMs在内容审核中的潜力，并公开数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

Motivation: 解决部分标注数据集中已知动作和未知动作的标注问题，适用于神经科学等领域中模糊或缺失标签的场景。

Method: 采用Granularity-Guided Segmentation Module (GGSM)和Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA)两步法，分别处理时间和语义粒度。

Result: 在Breakfast、50Salads和Desktop Assembly数据集上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Action Discovery方法有效解决了部分标注数据集中的动作分割问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Instruction是一种可扩展且高效的数据生成引擎，为生成智能提供了潜力。

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

Motivation: 解决VLP模型在细粒度定位和类别依赖关系建模上的不足，提升开放词汇多标签识别的性能。

Method: 提出DART框架，包含自适应细化模块（ARM）和自适应转移模块（ATM），分别优化定位和类别关系。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DART通过结合弱监督和外部知识，显著提升了OV-MLR任务的性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有视觉分词器在压缩比和重建保真度之间难以平衡，WeTok旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用分组无查找量化（GQ）和生成解码（GD）技术，提升效率和重建质量。

Result: 在ImageNet 50k验证集上，WeTok创下最低零样本rFID记录（0.12），并在高压缩比下表现优异。

Conclusion: WeTok在视觉生成任务中表现出色，为视觉分词器提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE为二元图像-文本相关性评估提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

Conclusion: Hi3DEval提供了一种可扩展的替代手动评估的方法，显著提升了3D生成内容的质量评估能力。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSEv2是一个更具挑战性的视频对象分割数据集，旨在推动真实场景下的研究，包含复杂场景、多样挑战和性能下降的基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VOS数据集主要关注显著、孤立对象，限制了在真实场景中的泛化能力，MOSEv2旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过构建包含复杂场景（如遮挡、恶劣天气、低光照等）的5,024个视频和701,976个高质量掩码的数据集MOSEv2。

Result: 基准测试显示，现有VOS方法在MOSEv2上性能显著下降（如SAM2从76.4%降至50.9%）。

Conclusion: MOSEv2揭示了当前VOS方法在真实场景中的局限性，为未来研究提供了更现实的测试平台。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

*Weiqi Zhang,Junsheng Zhou,Haotian Geng,Wenyuan Zhang,Yu-Shen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAP是一种新方法，通过文本引导将原始点云转换为高保真3D高斯分布，解决了无色点云直接生成高斯的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补无色3D点云直接生成高斯的空白，提升3D高斯渲染的质量和效率。

Method: 采用多视角优化框架，结合深度感知图像扩散模型和表面锚定机制，确保几何精度和一致性。

Result: 在合成点云、真实扫描和大规模场景中均表现出色，成功生成高保真3D高斯分布。

Conclusion: GAP为点云到高斯的转换提供了高效且高质量的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceAnonyMixer 是一种可取消的人脸生成框架，通过混合真实人脸图像的潜在代码与可撤销密钥生成的合成代码，生成隐私保护的人脸图像，同时满足生物特征模板保护的要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人脸匿名化方法通常仅关注身份隐藏，未能满足生物特征模板保护的可撤销性、不可链接性和不可逆性要求。

Method: 利用预训练生成模型的潜在空间，混合真实人脸图像的潜在代码与可撤销密钥生成的合成代码，并通过多目标损失函数优化。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，FaceAnonyMixer 在保持高识别精度的同时，显著增强了隐私保护，商业 API 上比现有方法提升了 11%。

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer 提供了一种高效且隐私保护的人脸生成方法，适用于现有的人脸识别系统。

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

TL;DR: AgenticData是一个创新的数据代理分析系统，通过自然语言查询自动分析多领域数据，显著提升分析效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非结构化数据分析系统依赖专家编写代码和管理复杂工作流，成本高且耗时。

Method: 采用反馈驱动规划技术将自然语言查询转换为语义计划，结合多代理协作策略（数据剖析代理、语义交叉验证代理和智能记忆代理）和语义优化模型。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，AgenticData在简单和复杂任务上均表现出色，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AgenticData通过自动化多代理协作和语义优化，有效解决了传统数据分析系统的局限性。

Abstract: Existing unstructured data analytics systems rely on experts to write code
and manage complex analysis workflows, making them both expensive and
time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticData, an
innovative agentic data analytics system that allows users to simply pose
natural language (NL) questions while autonomously analyzing data sources
across multiple domains, including both unstructured and structured data.
First, AgenticData employs a feedback-driven planning technique that
automatically converts an NL query into a semantic plan composed of relational
and semantic operators. We propose a multi-agent collaboration strategy by
utilizing a data profiling agent for discovering relevant data, a semantic
cross-validation agent for iterative optimization based on feedback, and a
smart memory agent for maintaining short-term context and long-term knowledge.
Second, we propose a semantic optimization model to refine and execute semantic
plans effectively. Our system, AgenticData, has been tested using three
benchmarks. Experimental results showed that AgenticData achieved superior
accuracy on both easy and difficult tasks, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods.

*Ugur Cetintemel,Shu Chen,Alexander W. Lee,Deepti Raghavan*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SPEAR是一种语言和运行时系统，旨在通过结构化、自适应和第一类提示管理解决现代LLM流程中提示的脆弱性和不透明性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM流程中，提示作为核心元素仍是一个脆弱且不透明的字符串，与数据流脱节，限制了重用、优化和运行时控制。

Method: SPEAR通过定义提示代数，支持运行时提示动态调整（基于执行信号）和结构化提示管理（版本化视图、内省和日志）。

Result: 初步实验量化了不同提示调整模式（手动、辅助、自动）与静态提示和代理重试的对比，以及提示级优化（如操作符融合）的影响。

Conclusion: SPEAR通过将提示逻辑视为结构化数据，实现了优化和运行时控制，填补了提示管理空白。

Abstract: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they
retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and
adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process
-- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the
surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime
control.
  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a
language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts
structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR
enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in
response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing
context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments
into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.
  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and
adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual,
assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and
automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables
optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.
Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes
compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of
prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

Motivation: 解决自然语言查询中的歧义问题，提升查询精度，同时保持系统效率。

Method: 结合语义相关性、目录信息增益和潜在成本降低，选择最优澄清问题。

Result: 在三个数据集上验证，DASG提高了查询精度且保持高效。

Conclusion: DASG建立了一种协作分析范式，系统主动参与查询制定而非被动翻译用户请求。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Data-Aware Socratic Guidance (DASG), a
dialogue-based query enhancement framework that embeds \linebreak interactive
clarification as a first-class operator within database systems to resolve
ambiguity in natural language queries. DASG treats dialogue as an optimization
decision, asking clarifying questions only when the expected execution cost
reduction exceeds the interaction overhead. The system quantifies ambiguity
through linguistic fuzziness, schema grounding confidence, and projected costs
across relational and vector backends. Our algorithm selects the optimal
clarifications by combining semantic relevance, catalog-based information gain,
and potential cost reduction. We evaluate our proposed framework on three
datasets. The results show that DASG demonstrates improved query precision
while maintaining efficiency, establishing a cooperative analytics paradigm
where systems actively participate in query formulation rather than passively
translating user requests.

Method: 利用随机线性网络编码（RLNC）技术，设计OPTIMUMP2P算法，并在仿真和实际环境中评估其性能。

Result: 实验结果显示OPTIMUMP2P在信息传播速度和可靠性上优于Gossipsub协议。

Conclusion: OPTIMUMP2P通过RLNC技术显著提升了P2P网络中的信息传播效率，适用于对抗恶意攻击的场景。

Abstract: Gossip algorithms are pivotal in the dissemination of information within
decentralized systems. Consequently, numerous gossip libraries have been
developed and widely utilized especially in blockchain protocols for the
propagation of blocks and transactions. A well-established library is libp2p,
which provides two gossip algorithms: floodsup and gossibsup. These algorithms
enable the delivery of published messages to a set of peers. In this work we
aim to enhance the performance and reliability of libp2p by introducing
OPTIMUMP2P, a novel gossip algorithm that leverages the capabilities of Random
Linear Network Coding (RLNC) to expedite the dissemination of information in a
peer-to-peer (P2P) network while ensuring reliable delivery, even in the
presence of malicious actors capable of corrupting the transmitted data.
Preliminary research from the Ethereum Foundation has demonstrated the use of
RLNC in the significant improvement in the block propagation time [14]. Here we
present extensive evaluation results both in simulation and real-world
environments that demonstrate the performance gains of OPTIMUMP2P over the
Gossipsub protocol.

Result: 分析了不同场景下算法的竞争比，揭示了不对称通信对搜索效率的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为理解通信不对称性在线性搜索中的作用提供了新见解。

Abstract: We consider linear search for capturing an oblivious moving target by two
autonomous robots with different communicating abilities. Both robots can
communicate Face-to-Face (F2F) when co-located but in addition one robot is a
Sender (can also send messages wirelessly) and the other also a Receiver (can
also receive messages wirelessly). This is known as Sender/Receiver (S/R, for
short) communication model. The robots can move with max speed $1$. The moving
target starts at distance $d$ from the origin and can move either with speed
$v<1$ away from the origin in the ``away'' model or with speed $v \geq 0$
toward the origin in the ``toward'' model. We assume that the direction of
motion of the target (i.e., whether it is the away or toward model) is known to
the robots in advance. To capture the target the two robots must be co-located
with it.
  We design new linear search algorithms and analyze the competitive ratio of
the time required to capture the target. The approach takes into account
various scenarios related to what the robots know about the search environment
(e.g., starting distance or speed of the mobile, away or toward model, or a
combination thereof). Our study contributes to understanding how asymmetric
communication affects the competitive ratio of linear search.

Motivation: 现有调度策略要么性能不佳，要么扩展性差，亟需一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 将调度约束建模为图匹配问题，设计了减少任务迁移开销和提高任务打包效率的策略。

Result: 实验表明，Tesserae调度器将平均作业完成时间（JCT）提升至1.62倍，总完成时间（Makespan）提升至1.15倍。

Conclusion: 基于图匹配的调度策略在性能和扩展性上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models has become a dominant workload in
data-centers and improving resource utilization is a key goal of DL cluster
schedulers. In order to do this, schedulers typically incorporate placement
policies that govern where jobs are placed on the cluster. Existing placement
policies are either designed as ad-hoc heuristics or incorporated as
constraints within a complex optimization problem and thus either suffer from
suboptimal performance or poor scalability. Our key insight is that many
placement constraints can be formulated as graph matching problems and based on
that we design novel placement policies for minimizing job migration overheads
and job packing. We integrate these policies into Tesserae and describe how our
design leads to a scalable and effective GPU cluster scheduler. Our
experimental results show that Tesserae improves average JCT by up to 1.62x and
the Makespan by up to 1.15x compared with the existing schedulers.

Abstract: High-order solvers for compressible flows are vital in scientific
applications. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a key technique for reducing
computational cost by concentrating resolution in regions of interest. In this
work, we develop an AMR-based numerical solver using Regent, a high-level
programming language for the Legion programming model. We address several
challenges associated with implementing AMR in Regent. These include dynamic
data structures for patch refinement/coarsening, mesh validity enforcement, and
reducing task launch overhead via task fusion. Experimental results show that
task fusion achieves 18x speedup, while automated GPU kernel generation via
simple annotations yields 9.7x speedup for the targeted kernel. We demonstrate
our approach through simulations of two canonical compressible flow problems
governed by the Euler equations.

Abstract: Online analytical processing of queries on datasets in the many-terabyte
range is only possible with costly distributed computing systems. To decrease
the cost and increase the throughput, systems can leverage accelerators such as
GPUs, which are now ubiquitous in the compute infrastructure. This introduces
many challenges, the majority of which are related to when, where, and how to
best move data around the system. We present Theseus -- a production-ready
enterprise-scale distributed accelerator-native query engine designed to
balance data movement, memory utilization, and computation in an
accelerator-based system context. Specialized asynchronous control mechanisms
are tightly coupled to the hardware resources for the purpose of network
communication, data pre-loading, data spilling across memories and storage, and
GPU compute tasks. The memory subsystem contains a mechanism for fixed-size
page-locked host memory allocations to increase throughput and reduce memory
fragmentation. For the TPC-H benchmarks at scale factors ranging from 1k to 30k
on cloud infrastructure, Theseus outperforms Databricks Photon by up to
$4\times$ at cost parity. Theseus is capable of processing all queries of the
TPC-H and TPC-DS benchmarks at scale factor 100k (100 TB scale) with as few as

Abstract: The growing demand for large-scale GPU clusters in distributed model training
presents a significant barrier to innovation, particularly in model
optimization, performance tuning, and system-level enhancements. To address
this challenge, LLM training simulators are employed to estimate training time
and guide design decisions. However, the state-of-the-art LLM training
simulators assume homogeneous compute and network infrastructure. In practice,
device heterogeneity is inevitable due to resource sharing in cloud
environments, frequent shifts in device generations, and inherent intra-chip
interconnect heterogeneity. To address the gap between state-of-the-art and
practical requirements, we propose the design of a heterogeneity-aware
distributed LLM simulator capable of predicting training time while enabling
abstractions to specify custom configurations for device groups and
device-to-parallelism mapping. We present the design requirements and
challenges in building a heterogeneity-aware distributed ML training simulator,
and design components such as non-uniform workload partitioning. Our initial
simulation results demonstrate the impact of heterogeneity on the model
computation and communication time.

Motivation: 现有下载工具因静态并发设置无法适应动态网络条件，导致带宽利用不足和下载时间延长。

Method: FastBioDL将下载过程建模为在线优化问题，利用效用函数和梯度下降实时调整并发流数量。

Result: 在公共基因组数据集上，FastBioDL比现有工具快4倍；在高速网络中快2.1倍。

Conclusion: FastBioDL为大规模基因组数据获取提供了高效解决方案，无需依赖专业商业软件或协议。

Abstract: Modern next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects routinely generate terabytes
of data, which researchers commonly download from public repositories such as
SRA or ENA. Existing download tools often employ static concurrency settings,
leading to inefficient bandwidth utilization and prolonged download times due
to their inability to adapt to dynamic network conditions. We introduce
FastBioDL, a parallel file downloader designed for large biological datasets,
featuring an adaptive concurrency controller. FastBioDL frames the download
process as an online optimization problem, utilizing a utility function and
gradient descent to adjust the number of concurrent socket streams in real-time
dynamically. This approach maximizes download throughput while minimizing
resource overhead. Comprehensive evaluations on public genomic datasets
demonstrate that FastBioDL achieves up to $4x$ speedup over state-of-the-art
tools. Moreover, in high-speed network experiments, its adaptive design was up
to $2.1x$ faster than existing tools. By intelligently optimizing standard HTTP
or FTP downloads on the client side, FastBioDL provides a robust and efficient
solution for large-scale genomic data acquisition, democratizing
high-performance data retrieval for researchers without requiring specialized

Motivation: 传统文件传输工具因固定配置或单一优化方法导致资源利用不足和不稳定，无法满足高性能应用需求。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（PPO）代理，结合轻量级网络系统模拟器进行离线训练，模块化设计解耦I/O和网络任务。

Result: 在测试中，AutoMDT实现了8倍收敛速度和68%传输完成时间减少。

Conclusion: AutoMDT通过模块化和强化学习显著提升了数据传输效率和适应性。

Abstract: High-performance applications necessitate rapid and dependable transfer of
massive datasets across geographically dispersed locations. Traditional file
transfer tools often suffer from resource underutilization and instability
because of fixed configurations or monolithic optimization methods. We propose
AutoMDT, a novel modular data transfer architecture that employs a deep
reinforcement learning based agent to simultaneously optimize concurrency
levels for read, network, and write operations. Our solution incorporates a
lightweight network-system simulator, enabling offline training of a Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in approximately 45 minutes on average, thereby
overcoming the impracticality of lengthy online training in production
networks. AutoMDT's modular design decouples I/O and network tasks, allowing
the agent to capture complex buffer dynamics precisely and to adapt quickly to
changing system and network conditions. Evaluations on production-grade
testbeds show that AutoMDT achieves up to 8x faster convergence and a 68%
reduction in transfer completion times compared with state-of-the-art
solutions.

Abstract: This paper presents a joint framework that integrates reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) with Terahertz (THz) communications and
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance smart industrial
communications. The proposed system leverages the advantages of RIS and THz
bands to improve spectral efficiency, coverage, and reliability key
requirements for industrial automation and real-time communications in future
6G networks and beyond. Within this framework, two power allocation strategies
are investigated: the first optimally distributes power between near and far
industrial nodes, and the second prioritizes network demands to enhance system
performance further. A performance evaluation is conducted to compare the sum
rate and outage probability against a fixed power allocation scheme. Our scheme
achieves up to a 23% sum rate gain over fixed PA at 30 dBm. Simulation results
validate the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness and
robustness of the RIS-assisted NOMA MIMO framework for THz enabled industrial
communications.

Abstract: This paper presents the concept, architectural design, and performance
evaluation of a 5G Mobile Cell (MC) used to provide 5G wireless connectivity to
User Equipment (UE) in areas with limited fixed 5G infrastructures or subject
to adverse radio conditions. We consider two main approaches to MC design: an
overlay model, where the MC obtains backhaul connectivity from a 5G overlay
network, and an Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB)-based model, discussing
their protocol stacks and architectural implications. In order to validate the
MC's performance, we employ an emulation-based testbed using the
OpenAirInterface (OAI) implementation, considering different MC positions. The
results validate the MC concept and demonstrate that MC positioning
significantly influences network performance. This paper has the potential to
aid network operators and service providers in selecting and deploying MC
architectures for temporary coverage extension and capacity reinforcement in
different environments, including seaports, industrial scenarios, and public
safety.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个保证混合模式更新一致性的算法，基于服务操作的语义特性（如交换性），并证明语义感知是避免不一致的必要条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线服务通常采用可扩展的微服务架构，但动态更新功能时避免混合模式操作导致的不一致性具有挑战性。现有方法要么效率低下，要么存在严重服务失败风险。

Method: 提出基于服务操作语义特性的算法，并开发理论框架以形式化混合模式更新的原子性要求。

Result: 证明了语义感知是避免不一致的必要条件，并提出了新的算法及其正确性。

Conclusion: 论文为混合模式更新提供了理论支持和实用算法，确保了服务更新的原子性和一致性。

Abstract: Online services are commonly implemented with a scalable microservice
architecture, where isomorphic worker processes service client requests,
recording persistent state in a backend data store. To maintain service, any
modifications to the service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as
the service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is
challenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding potential
inconsistencies caused by ''mixed mode'' operation, where workers of current
and new versions are concurrently active and interact via the data store. Some
update methods avoid mixed mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial
inefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving
throughput. The alternative is a so-called ''rolling'' update, which is
uncontrolled and runs the risk of serious service failures arising from
inconsistent mixed-mode behavior.
  In this paper, we present the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for
mixed mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service
actions, such as commutativity. We show that semantic awareness is required, by
proving that any semantically oblivious, mixed-mode update method cannot avoid
inconsistencies. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service
update takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to
inconsistent mixed-mode behavior. We introduce a framework that formalizes this
intuition and develop foundational theory for reasoning about the consistency
of mixed-mode updates, applying that theory to derive the new algorithms and
establish their correctness.

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPT-4o mini在ML项目中生成文件级日志的能力，发现其能部分匹配人类日志位置，但存在过度记录和特定场景下的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在文件级日志生成中的潜力，尤其是在机器学习（ML）应用中，以提升系统可靠性。

Method: 收集171个ML仓库的4,073个Python文件，移除原始日志后，用LLM生成日志，并对比人类日志的位置、级别、变量和文本质量。

Result: LLM在63.91%的情况下与人类日志位置一致，但过度记录率达82.66%，且在大型代码块和项目特定日志规范中存在困难。

Conclusion: LLM在文件级日志生成中表现出潜力，但需解决过度记录和特定场景下的问题才能实际应用。

Abstract: Logging is essential in software development, helping developers monitor
system behavior and aiding in debugging applications. Given the ability of
large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers
are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work
focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log
generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications,
where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate
the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML
projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing
4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed
the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them,
and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text
quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we
manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common
patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place
as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of
82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level
logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function,
difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with
project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for
generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed
for practical implementation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化流程，将游戏bug报告中的视频缩减为最能匹配bug描述的单帧图像，显著减少了开发者的手动工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代游戏工作室快速发布新版本和补丁，产生大量包含游戏视频的bug报告，手动审查这些视频耗时且难以扩展。

Method: 使用FFmpeg提取关键帧，再通过视觉-语言模型（GPT-4o）评估并选择最匹配bug描述的代表性帧。

Result: 在真实游戏视频和JIRA bug报告上测试，F1分数为0.79，准确率为0.89，性能因bug类别而异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提供即时视觉证据，显著提升了bug审查效率，对游戏行业QA团队和开发者具有实际价值。

Abstract: Modern game studios deliver new builds and patches at a rapid pace,
generating thousands of bug reports, many of which embed gameplay videos. To
verify and triage these bug reports, developers must watch the submitted
videos. This manual review is labour-intensive, slow, and hard to scale. In
this paper, we introduce an automated pipeline that reduces each video to a
single frame that best matches the reported bug description, giving developers
instant visual evidence that pinpoints the bug.
  Our pipeline begins with FFmpeg for keyframe extraction, reducing each video
to a median of just 1.90% of its original frames while still capturing bug
moments in 98.79 of cases. These keyframes are then evaluated by a
vision--language model (GPT-4o), which ranks them based on how well they match
the textual bug description and selects the most representative frame. We
evaluated this approach using real-world developer-submitted gameplay videos
and JIRA bug reports from a popular First-Person Shooter (FPS) game. The
pipeline achieves an overall F1 score of 0.79 and Accuracy of 0.89 for the
top-1 retrieved frame. Performance is highest for the Lighting & Shadow (F1 =
0.94), Physics & Collision (0.86), and UI & HUD (0.83) bug categories, and
lowest for Animation & VFX (0.51).
  By replacing video viewing with an immediately informative image, our
approach dramatically reduces manual effort and speeds up triage and regression
checks, offering practical benefits to quality assurance (QA) teams and
developers across the game industry.

Abstract: Open Source Software communities face a wave of uncertainty as Generative AI
rapidly transforms how software is created, maintained, and governed. Without
clear frameworks, communities risk being overwhelmed by the complexity and

development across four domains: software practices, documentation, community
engagement, and governance. By adopting this lens, OSS leaders and researchers
can proactively shape the future of their ecosystems, rather than simply
reacting to technological upheaval.

Result: 超过一半的ABNN故障源于注意力机制特有原因，提出了四种诊断启发式方法。

Conclusion: 研究填补了注意力机制故障分类的空白，为实践者提供了系统诊断工具。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are at the core of modern neural architectures, powering
systems ranging from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles and driving a major
economic impact. However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical
outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention
weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault
taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by
attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable
diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive
empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work
is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96
projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack
Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven
attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results
show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to
attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations
of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root
cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that
explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic
diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.

Abstract: We find ourselves in the midst of an explosion in artificial intelligence
research, particularly with large language models (LLMs). These models have
diverse applications spanning finance, commonsense knowledge graphs, medicine,
and visual analysis. In the world of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), a robust
body of knowledge and methods has been developed for managing complex tasks
through object-oriented thinking. However, the intersection of LLMs with OOP
remains an underexplored territory. Empirically, we currently possess limited
understanding of how LLMs can enhance the effectiveness of OOP learning and
code writing, as well as how we can evaluate such AI-powered tools. Our work
aims to address this gap by presenting a vision from the perspectives of key
stakeholders involved in an OOP task: programmers, mariners, and experienced
programmers. We identify critical junctures within typical coding workflows
where the integration of LLMs can offer significant benefits. Furthermore, we
propose ways to augment existing logical reasoning and code writing, ultimately
enhancing the programming experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着软件系统复杂度的增加，准确识别和管理变更依赖变得至关重要，尤其是在跨团队多组件协作的场景中。

Method: 通过初步研究OpenStack系统中的依赖关系，提出两个机器学习模型：一个预测变更间依赖的可能性，另一个识别具体的依赖变更对。

Result: 模型表现良好，AUC分数分别为79.33%和91.89%，Brier分数为0.11和0.014。第二个模型的top-k召回率较高，但精度有待提升。

Conclusion: 提出的半自动化方法能有效帮助开发者提前识别依赖关系，减少延迟和搜索成本。

Abstract: As software systems grow in complexity, accurately identifying and managing
dependencies among changes becomes increasingly critical. For instance, a
change that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it.
Establishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate
changes effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature
deployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple
components across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment.
They serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing
configurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like
documentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary
study on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our
study revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over
the past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these
dependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay
of 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often
spend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a
median of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify
dependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML
models. The first model predicts the likelihood of dependencies among changes,
while the second identifies the exact pairs of dependent changes. Our proposed
models demonstrate strong performance, achieving average AUC scores of 79.33%
and 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014, respectively. Indeed, the
second model has a good top-k recall across all types of pairs, while the top-k
precision has room for improvement.

Motivation: 提高Android应用中错误定位的准确性和效率，减少开发者的手动调试时间。

Method: LadyBug连接到GitHub仓库，利用错误报告和UI交互记录（通过设备或模拟器上传）进行文本和UI信息的综合检索。

Result: 在包含80个错误报告的基准测试中，LadyBug优于纯文本检索方法，UI信息的利用显著提高了定位准确性。

Conclusion: LadyBug是一个高效的开源工具，通过结合文本和UI信息，显著提升了错误定位的准确性。

Abstract: This paper introduces LadyBug, a GitHub bot that automatically localizes bugs
for Android apps by combining UI interaction information with text retrieval.
LadyBug connects to an Android app's GitHub repository, and is triggered when a
bug is reported in the corresponding issue tracker. Developers can then record
a reproduction trace for the bug on a device or emulator and upload the trace
to LadyBug via the GitHub issue tracker. This enables LadyBug to utilize both
the text from the original bug description, and UI information from the
reproduction trace to accurately retrieve a ranked list of files from the
project that most likely contain the reported bug.
  We empirically evaluated LadyBug using an automated testing pipeline and
benchmark called RedWing that contains 80 fully-localized and reproducible bug
reports from 39 Android apps. Our results illustrate that LadyBug outperforms
text-retrieval-based baselines and that the utilization of UI information leads
to a substantial increase in localization accuracy. LadyBug is an open-source
tool, available at https://github.com/LadyBugML/ladybug.

Motivation: 当前基于测试结果的强化学习忽视了中间推理过程的质量，容易导致奖励欺骗问题。

Method: 开发了LCB-RB基准和OD-based奖励模型训练方法，并提出了P-GRPO算法，选择性奖励成功任务的推理过程。

Result: 7B参数模型在代码生成任务中表现优异，超越基线4.5%，与GPT-4-Turbo相当。方法还可推广至数学任务。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了奖励欺骗问题，提升了推理质量和任务性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for
large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based
rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning
process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising
direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model
learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.
To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively
incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable
reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference
pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score
reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method
for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs
by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along
curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical
rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other
benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method
that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying
rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO
effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning
with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior
performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only
baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further
demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to
mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.

Motivation: 许多领域缺乏标准化的模型，且创建这些模型对非专家来说是一个重大障碍。

Method: 结合大语言模型（LLMs）和确定性技术，通过自然语言输入实现JSON Schema的创建、修改和映射，并集成到MetaConfigurator工具中。

Result: 在化学领域的应用示例中验证了方法的适用性，显著降低了非专家在数据建模和集成中的门槛。

Conclusion: 通过自然语言交互与确定性保障的结合，为非专家提供了更便捷的结构化数据建模和数据集成解决方案。

Abstract: Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) places models at the core of system and data
engineering processes. In the context of research data, these models are
typically expressed as schemas that define the structure and semantics of
datasets. However, many domains still lack standardized models, and creating
them remains a significant barrier, especially for non-experts. We present a
hybrid approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with deterministic
techniques to enable JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping
based on natural language inputs by the user. These capabilities are integrated
into the open-source tool MetaConfigurator, which already provides visual model
editing, validation, code generation, and form generation from models. For data
integration, we generate schema mappings from heterogeneous JSON, CSV, XML, and
YAML data using LLMs, while ensuring scalability and reliability through
deterministic execution of generated mapping rules. The applicability of our
work is demonstrated in an application example in the field of chemistry. By
combining natural language interaction with deterministic safeguards, this work
significantly lowers the barrier to structured data modeling and data
integration for non-experts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准（如HumanEval和MBPP）主要评估功能正确性，而复杂推理任务评估不足，导致模型得分饱和，缺乏区分能力。

Method: 提出SX-Bench，通过多子函数协作任务（如链式调用、嵌套循环）评估整体控制和数据流建模能力，以“计算步骤”为最小执行单元。

Result: 在20多个主流模型上测试，即使是OpenAI-O3在Hard-Reasoning任务上准确率仅为78.37%，显著低于其在传统基准上的表现。

Conclusion: SX-Bench将代码评估从“单函数验证”推进到“多函数动态推理”，为深入评估代码智能模型提供了关键工具。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in code intelligence, yet systematically evaluating their code understanding
and reasoning abilities remains challenging. Mainstream benchmarks such as
HumanEval and MBPP primarily assess functional correctness, while reasoning
benchmarks like CRUXEVAL are limited to single-function, low-complexity
scenarios. As a result, advanced models achieve nearly saturated scores,
limiting their discriminative power. To address this, we present
STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark designed for complex
multi-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench
features tasks involving collaboration among multiple sub-functions (e.g.,
chained calls, nested loops), shifting evaluation towards overall control and
data flow modeling. It defines "computation steps" as the minimal execution
unit and requires models to predict the total number of steps in reasoning
tasks, thereby assessing a model's in-depth understanding of dynamic execution
beyond simple I/O matching. Evaluation on over 20 mainstream models (including
14 reasoning-enhanced models) demonstrates that SX-Bench is highly
discriminative: even the state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3 achieves only 78.37 percent
accuracy on Hard-Reasoning tasks, much lower than its saturated scores on
previous benchmarks, thereby revealing bottlenecks in complex and fine-grained
reasoning. We also release an automated pipeline combining program synthesis,
symbolic execution, and LLM-aided validation for efficient benchmark generation
and quality assurance. SX-Bench advances code evaluation from "single-function
verification" to "multi-function dynamic reasoning," providing a key tool for
the in-depth assessment of advanced code intelligence models.

EvoGraph represents every artefact in a typed directed graph, applies learned

selects survivors with a multi-objective fitness. On three benchmarks, EvoGraph
fixes 83% of known security vulnerabilities, translates COBOL to Java with 93%
functional equivalence (test verified), and maintains documentation freshness
within two minutes. Experiments show a 40% latency reduction and a sevenfold
drop in feature lead time compared with strong baselines. We extend our
approach to **evoGraph**, leveraging language-specific SLMs for modernizing
.NET, Lisp, CGI, ColdFusion, legacy Python, and C codebases, achieving 82-96%
semantic equivalence across languages while reducing computational costs by 90%
compared to large language models. EvoGraph's design responds to empirical
failure modes in legacy modernization, such as implicit contracts, performance
preservation, and integration evolution. Our results suggest a practical path
toward Software 3.0, where systems adapt continuously yet remain under
measurable control.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种概念模型和方法论，利用物联网（IoT）技术提升业务流程（BPs）的可持续性，涵盖环境以外的维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注环境可持续性，而忽略了其他维度。本文旨在通过IoT技术全面衡量和提升BPs的可持续性。

Method: 提出概念模型，将BPM与IoT结合，并设计结构化方法论，分析现有BPs并实施可持续性增强的IoT-BPs。

Result: 通过旅游和医疗领域的案例验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IoT技术可系统性地提升BPs的可持续性，为未来研究提供了框架。

Abstract: The real-time data collection and automation capabilities offered by the
Internet of Things (IoT) are revolutionizing and transforming Business
Processes (BPs) into IoT-enhanced BPs, showing high potential for improving
sustainability. Although already studied in Business Process Management (BPM),
sustainability research has primarily focused on environmental concerns.
However, achieving a holistic and lasting impact requires a systematic approach
to address sustainability beyond the environmental dimension. This work
proposes a conceptual model and a structured methodology with the goal of
analyzing the potential of IoT to measure and improve the sustainability of
BPs. The conceptual model formally represents key sustainability concepts,
linking BPM and IoT by highlighting how IoT devices support and contribute to
sustainability. The methodology guides the systematic analysis of existing BPs,
identifies opportunities, and implements sustainability-aware, IoT-enhanced
BPs. The approach is illustrated through a running example from the tourism
domain and a case study in healthcare.

### [203] [Evaluating the Use of LLMs for Documentation to Code Traceability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16440)
*Ebube Alor,SayedHassan Khatoonabadi,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在文档与代码间建立追踪链接的能力，发现其表现优于传统基线方法，但在解释和多步链重建方面仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在自动化文档与代码追踪方面的潜力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过系统实验评估三种LLM（Claude 3.5 Sonnet、GPT-4o和o3-mini）在追踪链接识别、关系解释和多步链重建上的表现，使用两个开源项目的数据集。

Result: 最佳LLM在两个数据集上的F1分数分别为79.4%和80.4%，远超基线方法；关系解释的完全正确率为42.9%-71.1%，但部分准确率超过97%。

Conclusion: LLM是强大的追踪发现助手，但需结合人工干预，并需进一步研究其错误模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating
documentation-to-code traceability, yet their capabilities remain
underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs (Claude 3.5
Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini) in establishing trace links between various
software documentation (including API references and user guides) and source
code. We create two novel datasets from two open-source projects (Unity Catalog
and Crawl4AI). Through systematic experiments, we assess three key
capabilities: (1) trace link identification accuracy, (2) relationship
explanation quality, and (3) multi-step chain reconstruction. Results show that
the best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4% across the two
datasets, substantially outperforming our baselines (TF-IDF, BM25, and
CodeBERT). While fully correct relationship explanations range from 42.9% to
71.1%, partial accuracy exceeds 97%, indicating that fundamental connections
are rarely missed. For multi-step chains, LLMs maintain high endpoint accuracy
but vary in capturing precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals that
many false positives stem from naming-based assumptions, phantom links, or
overgeneralization of architectural patterns. We demonstrate that task-framing,
such as a one-to-many matching strategy, is critical for performance. These
findings position LLMs as powerful assistants for trace discovery, but their
limitations could necessitate human-in-the-loop tool design and highlight
specific error patterns for future research.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文研究了六种先进LLM在解决Python问题时推荐的库，发现它们倾向于第三方库，但存在可用性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解LLM如何推荐库对代码功能、安全和维护至关重要。

Method: 通过从Stack Overflow获取的Python问题，对六种LLM进行实证研究，分析其推荐的库类型和特性。

Result: LLM主要推荐成熟、流行的第三方库，但4.6%的库因导入名与安装包不匹配无法自动解析，仅两种模型提供安装指导。

Conclusion: 研究为开发者和研究者提供了改进LLM生成代码可靠性和可用性的方向。

Abstract: Software libraries are central to the functionality, security, and
maintainability of modern code. As developers increasingly turn to Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assist with programming tasks, understanding how
these models recommend libraries is essential. In this paper, we conduct an
empirical study of six state-of-the-art LLMs, both proprietary and open-source,
by prompting them to solve real-world Python problems sourced from Stack
Overflow. We analyze the types of libraries they import, the characteristics of
those libraries, and the extent to which the recommendations are usable out of
the box. Our results show that LLMs predominantly favour third-party libraries
over standard ones, and often recommend mature, popular, and permissively
licensed dependencies. However, we also identify gaps in usability: 4.6% of the
libraries could not be resolved automatically due to structural mismatches
between import names and installable packages, and only two models (out of six)
provided installation guidance. While the generated code is technically valid,
the lack of contextual support places the burden of manually resolving
dependencies on the user. Our findings offer actionable insights for both
developers and researchers, and highlight opportunities to improve the
reliability and usability of LLM-generated code in the context of software
dependencies.

### [205] [Assessing Dynamic Connectedness in Global Supply Chain Infrastructure Portfolios: The Impact of Risk Factors and Extreme Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04858)
*Haibo Wang*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文分析了全球供应链基础设施投资的风险因素（能源市场、投资者情绪、全球航运成本），并提出了动态风险相关的投资组合策略。通过TVP-VAR模型研究风险因素的溢出效应和互联性，发现ESG评分高的组合动态关联性更强。COVID-19疫情改变了动态关联结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究全球供应链基础设施投资的风险因素及其动态关联性，为投资策略提供依据，并探讨极端事件（如COVID-19）对风险溢出和投资结果的影响。

Method: 使用时间变参数向量自回归（TVP-VAR）模型，分析2010年至2023年全球供应链基础设施投资组合与风险因素的溢出效应和互联性，并结合ESG指数进行比较。

Result: ESG评分高的投资组合动态关联性更强；WTI、BDI和VIX是净接收者；COVID-19疫情改变了动态关联结构和投资策略的权重分配。

Conclusion: 全球供应链基础设施投资组合的风险溢出和动态关联性受ESG评分和极端事件影响，高ESG评分组合的对冲能力更强。

Abstract: This paper analyses the risk factors around investing in global supply chain
infrastructure: the energy market, investor sentiment, and global shipping
costs. It presents portfolio strategies associated with dynamic risks. A
time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) model is used to study
the spillover and interconnectedness of the risk factors for global supply
chain infrastructure portfolios from January 5th, 2010, to June 29th, 2023,
which are associated with a set of environmental, social, and governance (ESG)
indexes. The effects of extreme events on risk spillovers and investment
strategy are calculated and compared before and after the COVID-19 outbreak.
The results of this study demonstrate that risk shocks influence the dynamic
connectedness between global supply chain infrastructure portfolios and three
risk factors and show the effects of extreme events on risk spillovers and
investment outcomes. Portfolios with higher ESG scores exhibit stronger dynamic
connectedness with other portfolios and factors. Net total directional
connectedness indicates that West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Baltic Exchange Dry
Index (BDI), and investor sentiment volatility index (VIX) consistently are net
receivers of spillover shocks. A portfolio with a ticker GLFOX appears to be a
time-varying net receiver and giver. The pairwise connectedness shows that WTI
and VIX are mostly net receivers. Portfolios with tickers CSUAX, GII, and FGIAX
are mostly net givers of spillover shocks. The COVID-19 outbreak changed the
structure of dynamic connectedness on portfolios. The mean value of HR and HE
indicates that the weights of long/short positions in investment strategy after
the COVID-19 outbreak have undergone structural changes compared to the period
before. The hedging ability of global supply chain infrastructure investment
portfolios with higher ESG scores is superior.

*Senan Hogan-Hennessy*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种控制函数策略，用于在自然实验中估计因果中介效应，解决了传统方法因中介变量非随机分配导致的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果中介分析方法假设中介变量是随机分配的，但在实际应用中（如医疗选择、教育决策等），这一假设常不成立，导致估计偏差。

Method: 提出了一种基于工具变量的控制函数策略，通过中介变量的边际效应识别因果中介效应，支持参数或半参数估计。

Result: 在俄勒冈健康保险实验中，该方法揭示了医疗补助对健康与幸福感的中介效应，传统方法会误判。

Conclusion: 该方法为自然实验中因果中介效应的估计提供了新工具，尤其适用于初始治疗随机但中介变量非随机的情况。

Abstract: Natural experiments are a cornerstone of applied economics, providing
settings for estimating causal effects with a compelling argument for treatment
randomisation, but give little indication of the mechanisms behind causal
effects. Causal Mediation (CM) provides a framework to analyse mechanisms by
identifying the average direct and indirect effects (CM effects), yet
conventional CM methods require the relevant mediator is as-good-as-randomly
assigned. When people choose the mediator based on costs and benefits (whether
to visit a doctor, to attend university, etc.), this assumption fails and
conventional CM analyses are at risk of bias. I propose a control function
strategy that uses instrumental variation in mediator take-up costs, delivering
unbiased direct and indirect effects when selection is driven by unobserved
gains. The method identifies CM effects via the marginal effect of the
mediator, with parametric or semi-parametric estimation that is simple to
implement in two stages. Applying these methods to the Oregon Health Insurance
Experiment reveals a substantial portion of the Medicaid lottery's effect on
self-reported health and happiness flows through increased healthcare usage --
an effect that a conventional CM analysis would mistake. This approach gives
applied researchers an alternative method to estimate CM effects when an
initial treatment is quasi-randomly assigned, but the mediator is not, as is
common in natural experiments.

Motivation: 探讨美联储在不同经济危机中的沟通策略变化，特别是COVID-19期间的独特应对方式。

Method: 使用COVID-19、非传统货币政策和金融稳定相关的专业词典，结合情感分析和主题建模技术。

Result: 发现美联储在COVID-19期间更反应迅速，金融稳定相关情感下降预示宽松政策，非传统货币政策沟通成为常态。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了央行沟通策略在危机中的演变及其对特殊经济环境的适应性。

Abstract: In this study, we examine the Federal Reserve's communication strategies
during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with communication during previous
periods of economic stress. Using specialized dictionaries tailored to
COVID-19, unconventional monetary policy (UMP), and financial stability,
combined with sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques, we identify a
distinct focus in Fed communication during the pandemic on financial stability,
market volatility, social welfare, and UMP, characterized by notable contextual
uncertainty. Through comparative analysis, we juxtapose the Fed's communication
during the COVID-19 crisis with its responses during the dot-com and global
financial crises, examining content, sentiment, and timing dimensions. Our
findings reveal that Fed communication and policy actions were more reactive to
the COVID-19 crisis than to previous crises. Additionally, declining sentiment
related to financial stability in interest rate announcements and minutes
anticipated subsequent accommodative monetary policy decisions. We further
document that communicating about UMP has become the "new normal" for the Fed's
Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Chairman's speeches since the
Global Financial Crisis, reflecting an institutional adaptation in
communication strategy following periods of economic distress. These findings
contribute to our understanding of how central bank communication evolves
during crises and how communication strategies adapt to exceptional economic
circumstances.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于阈值的股票网络存在主观参数选择和二元关系限制，无法捕捉相关强度和负相关性。

Method: 提出统计验证的相关性网络，定义LSCBM并通过MaxBalanceCore算法高效检测。

Result: LSCBM在随机符号图模型中具有渐近存在性，实证分析显示其能动态响应市场变化。

Conclusion: LSCBM为市场子系统分析提供了新工具，尤其在危机时期表现显著。

Abstract: Traditional threshold-based stock networks suffer from subjective parameter
selection and inherent limitations: they constrain relationships to binary
representations, failing to capture both correlation strength and negative
dependencies. To address this, we introduce statistically validated correlation
networks that retain only statistically significant correlations via a rigorous
t-test of Pearson coefficients. We then propose a novel structure termed the
largest strong-correlation balanced module (LSCBM), defined as the maximum-size
group of stocks with structural balance (i.e., positive edge-ign products for
all triplets) and strong pairwise correlations. This balance condition ensures
stable relationships, thus facilitating potential hedging opportunities through
negative edges. Theoretically, within a random signed graph model, we establish
LSCBM's asymptotic existence, size scaling, and multiplicity under various
parameter regimes. To detect LSCBM efficiently, we develop MaxBalanceCore, a
heuristic algorithm that leverages network sparsity. Simulations validate its
efficiency, demonstrating scalability to networks of up to 10,000 nodes within
tens of seconds. Empirical analysis demonstrates that LSCBM identifies core
market subsystems that dynamically reorganize in response to economic shifts
and crises. In the Chinese stock market (2013-2024), LSCBM's size surges during
high-stress periods (e.g., the 2015 crash) and contracts during stable or
fragmented regimes, while its composition rotates annually across dominant
sectors (e.g., Industrials and Financials).

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于动态博弈中基础对象的抽象通用语言，结合决策树理论和外生不确定性概念，引入了随机决策森林模型，并进一步推广为随机扩展形式。通过时间半轴的有序性确保了模型的良好性，并提出了随机过程形式以解决瞬时反应问题。

Motivation: 研究动态博弈中概率不确定性下的基础对象，旨在构建一个通用的语言和模型，以更广泛地描述动态决策问题，并为连续时间博弈的近似理论奠定基础。

Method: 结合Alós-Ferrer--Ritzberger的决策树理论和Harsanyian外生不确定性概念，提出随机决策森林模型，并推广为随机扩展形式。通过时间半轴的有序性确保模型良好性，并引入随机过程形式解决瞬时反应问题。

Result: 提出了随机扩展形式和随机过程形式，能够描述广泛的动态决策问题，并解决了瞬时反应和信息问题。模型适用于随机微分和时机博弈。

Conclusion: 该研究为动态博弈提供了一种通用的语言和模型，解决了瞬时反应问题，并为连续时间博弈的近似理论提供了基础。

Abstract: In this work, an abstract and general language for the fundamental objects
underlying dynamic games under probabilistic uncertainty is developed.
Combining the theory of decision trees by Al\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger (2005) and
a Harsanyian notion of exogenous uncertainty, the concept of stochastic
decision forests is introduced. Exogenous information is modelled via
filtration-like objects providing dynamic updates on the "realised tree", and
an abstract decision-theoretic model of adapted choice is formulated.
  Based on this, a consistent model of "rules" is introduced, leading to the
notion of stochastic extensive forms, generalising Al\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger
(2008, 2011). Well-posedness is completely characterised in terms of
order-theoretic properties of the underlying forest. Moreover, the language of
stochastic extensive forms addresses a vast class of dynamic decision problems
formulated in terms of time-indexed paths of action -- a first step towards an
approximation theory of continuous-time games based on stochastic processes. In
this formulation, a well-posed theory obtains if and only if the time half-axis
is essentially well-ordered.
  Therefore, a relaxed game-theoretic model of "extensive form characteristics"
is introduced: the stochastic process form. Its action processes arise from
well-posed action path stochastic extensive forms under tilting convergence,
which is introduced in order to faithfully describe accumulating reaction
behaviour. The problem of instantaneous reaction and information about it is
tackled by introducing vertically extended continuous time, for which a
suitable stochastic analysis is developed. Stochastic process forms admit a
natural notion of information sets, subgames, and equilibrium. The theory
applies to stochastic differential and timing games, e.g., addressing issues in
Fudenberg--Tirole (1985) and Riedel--Steg (2017) .

Motivation: 探讨对象分配问题中彩票规则的效率等价性，以简化现有特征化结果。

Method: 通过分析满足事后非浪费性和概率单调性的彩票规则，证明事后配对效率与事后帕累托效率的等价性。

Result: 证明了事后配对效率与事后帕累托效率的等价性，可用于强化现有规则的特征化结果。

Conclusion: 该结果为彩票规则和确定性规则的特征化提供了更简化的条件，例如随机序列独裁规则和交易周期规则。

Abstract: We consider object allocation problems with capacities (see, e.g.,
Abdulkadiroglu and Sonmez, 1998; Basteck, 2025) where objects have to be
assigned to agents. We show that if a lottery rule satisfies ex-post
non-wastefulness and probabilistic (Maskin) monotonicity, then ex-post pairwise
efficiency is equivalent to ex-post Pareto efficiency. This result allows for a
strengthening of various existing characterization results, both for lottery
rules and deterministic rules, by replacing (ex-post) Pareto efficiency with
(ex-post) pairwise efficiency, e.g., for characterizations of the Random Serial
Dictatorship rule (Basteck, 2025), Trading Cycles rules (Pycia and Unver,
2017), and Hierarchical Exchange rules (Papai, 2000).

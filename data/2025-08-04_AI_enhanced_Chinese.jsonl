While prior\nliterature shows that multichannel customers tend to be more valuable, it\noverlooks how the reason for adopting a new channel may shape post-adoption\nbehavior. Using transaction-level data from a major Brazilian pet supplies\nretailer, we examine how adoption of online shopping - by previously\noffline-only customers - affects post-adoption spend, profitability, and\nchannel usage. We study four distinct adoption pathways: organic adoption,\nadoption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Black Friday promotions, and a newly\nlaunched loyalty program. We find that although all adopter groups increase\ntheir spending relative to offline-only customers, post-adoption behavior\ndiffers based on the reason for adoption. COVID-19 adopters behave similarly to\norganic adopters in terms of spending, but show greater offline stickiness\nconsistent with consumer inertia and habit theory, yielding higher profits due\nto higher offline margins. In contrast, promotion-driven adopters spend less\npost-adoption due to forward buying and exhibit lower profitability. Our\nfindings caution against treating all multichannel customers as equal and\nhighlight the importance of incorporating behavioral theories into forecasting\nand targeting strategies.

The\ncentral innovation of this work is the abandonment of the traditional\nCobb-Douglas production function in favor of a Constant Elasticity of\nSubstitution (CES) specification. This modification is directly motivated by\nthe compelling evidence from the meta-analysis by Gechert et al. (2021), which\nemphatically rejects the hypothesis of a unit elasticity of substitution\nbetween capital and labor. We integrate this finding with the conclusions from\na wide range of meta-analyses on the state-dependent heterogeneity of fiscal\nmultipliers (Gechert and Rannenberg, 2018), the productivity of public capital\n(Bom and Ligthart, 2014), the effectiveness hierarchy of spending instruments\n(Gechert, 2015), and the empirical failure of Ricardian Equivalence (Stanley,\n1998).

Granger\ncausality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time\nseries. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag\nassumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex\nsystems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses\nthis limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time\nlags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal\ninteractions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.\nFor example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region\nwith a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we\nformalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a\nnovel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling\nfrequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC,\ndemonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference\npipeline.

However, choosing between planar\nand spherical models remains challenging. Planar models neglect Earth's\ncurvature, causing deviations in high-altitude NTN analysis, yet are still\noften used for simplicity. This paper introduces relative error to quantify the\ngap between planar and spherical models, helping determine when planar modeling\nis sufficient. To calculate the relative error, we first propose a point\nprocess (PP) generation algorithm that simultaneously generates a pair of\nhomogeneous and asymptotically similar planar and spherical PPs. We then\nintroduce several typical similarity metrics, including topology-related and\nnetwork-level metrics, and further develop a relative error estimation\nalgorithm based on these metrics. In addition, we derive an analytical\nexpression for the optimal planar altitude, which reduces computational\ncomplexity and provides theoretical support for planar approximation.

We use the term Process Intelligence (PI) to refer to the\namalgamation of process-centric data-driven techniques able to deal with a\nvariety of object and event types, enabling AI in an organizational context.\nThis paper explains why AI requires PI to improve operational processes and\nhighlights opportunities for successfully combining OCPM and generative,\npredictive, and prescriptive AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\uff08OCPM\uff09\u5c06AI\u4e0e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u667a\u80fd\uff08PI\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528AI\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\uff08OCPM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u5f0f\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u6027AI\u3002", "result": "OCPM\u662f\u8fde\u63a5\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u667a\u80fd\uff08PI\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301AI\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u9700\u8981PI\u7684\u652f\u6301\u624d\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0cOCPM\u4e0e\u591a\u79cdAI\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present reinforcement learning-based approaches\nusing deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to dynamically optimize the\nage-of-information (AoI) in HAPS-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks.\nThe proposed method improves information freshness and overall network\nreliability by enabling independent learning without centralized coordination.\nThe findings reveal the potential of HAPS-supported solutions, combined with\nDDPG-based learning, for efficient AoI-aware resource allocation in\nplatoon-based autonomous vehicle systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\uff08DDPG\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316HAPS\u652f\u6301\u7684V2X\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\uff08AoI\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u901a\u4fe1\uff08HRLLC\uff09\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002\u975e\u5730\u9762\u7f51\u7edc\uff08NTN\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u7a7a\u5e73\u53f0\u7ad9\uff08HAPS\uff09\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\uff08DDPG\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316HAPS\u652f\u6301\u7684V2X\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\uff08AoI\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u96c6\u4e2d\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f66\u961f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "HAPS\u4e0eDDPG\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728AoI\u611f\u77e5\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002"}}

Membership inference (MI) has recently emerged as an\neffective tool for assessing privacy risk by identifying whether specific data\nbelong to a model's training set. In parallel, model compression techniques,\nespecially quantization, have gained traction for reducing computational costs\nand enabling the deployment of large models. However, while quantized models\nstill retain knowledge learned from the original training data, it remains\nunclear whether quantization affects their ability to retain and expose privacy\ninformation. Answering this question is of great importance to understanding\nprivacy risks in real-world deployments. In this work, we conduct the first\nempirical study on how quantization influences task performance and privacy\nrisk simultaneously in LLMs4Code.

This problem asks to verify whether every graph\nthat validates a SHACL specification will still do so after applying a given\nupdate sequence. More importantly, it provides a basis for further services for\nreasoning about evolving RDF graphs.

The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and\n(hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to\ndefining hierarchical model architectures - \"hierarchitectures\" - and local\nsampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them.

To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it\nis crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects\nreal-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test\ngeneration benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination\nand structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the\nvalidity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these\nlimited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to\ncontamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural\nsimplicity.\n  To address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new\nbenchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from\nreal-world Python functions. ULT is constructed through a multi-stage curation\nprocess that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case\ncontamination. With 3,909 carefully selected function-level tasks, ULT provides\na more realistic and challenging evaluation of LLMs' test generation\ncapabilities. We also provide PLT (PreLeakedTestbench), a pair benchmark of ULT\nwith leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization\nversus reasoning in test generation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that\nULT is significantly more challenging.

However, their diagnostic\nreliability in complex clinical scenarios remains limited. This study aims to\nenhance LLMs' diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning ability. Method: We\npropose an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to integrate structured\nclinical reasoning into LLM-based diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct\nClinical Reasoning Scaffolding (CRS) based on authoritative clinical guidelines\nfor three representative acute abdominal emergencies: acute appendicitis, acute\npancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Next, we develop the Etiology-Aware Head\nIdentification algorithm to pinpoint attention heads crucial for the model's\netiology reasoning. To ensure reliable clinical reasoning alignment, we\nintroduce the Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning that embeds\netiological reasoning cues into input representations and steers the selected\nEtiology-Aware Heads toward critical information through a Reasoning-Guided\nLoss function. Result: On the Consistent Diagnosis Cohort, our framework\nimproves average diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and boosts the average Reasoning\nFocus Score by 31.6% over baselines. External validation on the Discrepant\nDiagnosis Cohort further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing diagnostic\naccuracy.

An Empirical Study on a One-billion-user Online Service System", "comment": "Accepted by the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical\n  Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025)", "summary": "Background: It has long been suggested that user feedback, typically written\nin natural language by end-users, can help issue detection. However, for\nlarge-scale online service systems that receive a tremendous amount of\nfeedback, it remains a challenging task to identify severe issues from user\nfeedback. Aims: To develop a better feedback-based issue detection approach, it\nis crucial first to gain a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics\nof user feedback in real production systems. Method: In this paper, we conduct\nan empirical study on 50,378,766 user feedback items from six real-world\nservices in a one-billion-user online service system. We first study what users\nprovide in their feedback. We then examine whether certain features of feedback\nitems can be good indicators of severe issues. Finally, we investigate whether\nadopting machine learning techniques to analyze user feedback is reasonable.\nResults: Our results show that a large proportion of user feedback provides\nirrelevant information about system issues. As a result, it is crucial to\nfilter out issue-irrelevant information when processing user feedback.\nMoreover, we find severe issues that cannot be easily detected based solely on\nuser feedback characteristics. Finally, we find that the distributions of the\nfeedback topics in different time intervals are similar. This confirms that\ndesigning machine learning-based approaches is a viable direction for better\nanalyzing user feedback.

With the\ngrowing use of Large Language Models (LLM) as AI modeling assistants, more\nautomation will be involved in generating diagrams. This necessitates the\nadvancement of automatic model correctness evaluation tools. Such a tool can be\nused to evaluate both manually and AI automatically generated models; to\nprovide feedback to system engineers, and enable AI assistants to self-evaluate\nand self-enhance their generated models.\n  In this paper, we propose MCeT, the first fully automated tool to evaluate\nthe correctness of a behavioral model, sequence diagrams in particular, against\nits corresponding requirements text and produce a list of issues that the model\nhas. We utilize LLMs for the correctness evaluation tasks as they have shown\noutstanding natural language understanding ability. However, we show that\ndirectly asking an LLM to compare a diagram to requirements finds less than 35%\nof issues that experienced engineers can find. We propose to supplement the\ndirect check with a fine-grained, multi-perspective approach; we split the\ndiagram into atomic, non-divisible interactions, and split the requirements\ntext into atomic, self-contained items. We compare the diagram with atomic\nrequirements and each diagram-atom with the requirements.

The dataset comprises Python code\nsolutions across three difficulty levels: introductory, interview, and\ncompetition. We analyzed key code quality metrics, including maintainability\nand reliability, and the estimated effort required to resolve code issues.\nResults: Our analysis shows that LLM-generated code has fewer bugs and requires\nless effort to fix them overall. Interestingly, fine-tuned models reduced the\nprevalence of high-severity issues, such as blocker and critical bugs, and\nshifted them to lower-severity categories, but decreased the model's\nperformance. In competition-level problems, the LLM solutions sometimes\nintroduce structural issues that are not present in human-written code.\nConclusion: Our findings provide valuable insights into the quality of\nLLM-generated code; however, the introduction of critical issues in more\ncomplex scenarios highlights the need for a systematic evaluation and\nvalidation of LLM solutions. Our work deepens the understanding of the\nstrengths and limitations of LLMs for code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u5199\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8d28\u91cf\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\u7f3a\u9677\u66f4\u5c11\u4e14\u4fee\u590d\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u5199\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u4ee5\u53caSonarQube\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7f3a\u9677\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u4fee\u590d\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9ad8\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus\non the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the\nmodel has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which\nleverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of\nthe gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as\nthe criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We\nvalidate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream\ndatasets.

Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as\nAgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond\nonly when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems\nlack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution\nshifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime\nenforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis.\nPro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a\nDiscrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it\nanticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe\nstates, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted\nrisk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity\nchecks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability\nwhile approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard\nextensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and\nautonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early\non up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes\n(e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to\n80.4% task completion.

To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a\nmulti-agent system.\n  We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using\nAudio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video,\nand audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing\nevaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies\ngood from broken or mismatched content.\n  We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a\nbank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models). The coding agent selects\nrelevant assets, generates multiple initial codes, uses AVR-Eval to identify\nthe best version, and iteratively improves it through omni-modal agent feedback\nfrom the AVR.\n  We run experiments on games and animations with AVR-Eval (win rate of content\nA against B).

Sharpness-Aware\nMinimization (SAM) improves model generalization for both Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) and Transformers by encouraging convergence to locally flat\nminima. However, the connection between sharpness and generalization has not\nbeen fully explored for LoRA due to the lack of tools to either empirically\nseek flat minima or develop theoretical methods. In this work, we propose\nFlat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to seek flat minima for\nLoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full\nparameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach\neliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across\nmultiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large\nlanguage models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves\noptimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining\ncomparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with\nRoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and\n0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat\nshows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets,\nrespectively.

However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent\ntrade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject\nfidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text\neditability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free\nguidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output\ntoward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target\ndistribution, while AG compromises text alignment.

The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,\ni.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient\nfeature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the\nspatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas\nprior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior\nfeature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified\nspatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby\nenhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios.

Notably, CoST is not tied to any\nspecific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods,\nenhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08CoST\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u878d\u5408\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u878d\u5408\u548c\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u89c2\u6d4b\u7edf\u4e00\u878d\u5408\u5230\u65f6\u7a7a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "CoST\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CoST\u4e3a\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel\nneural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume\nrendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.\nFirstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the\nneural implicit field.

Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more\ntokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU\nmemory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has\nproposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative\ntokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been\ndeveloped to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction\nand its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most\ntraining-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to\ndetermine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a\ntraining-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each\ntoken's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with\nFlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further\ngeneralizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression\ncompatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and\n4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively.

The task spans three datasets, each designed with\ncontrolled and increasing thematic variety within documents. We propose to\naddress this problem by modeling the content of each problem instance - that\nis, a series of sentences - as a whole, using a Sequential Sentence Pair\nClassifier (SSPC). The architecture leverages a pre-trained language model\n(PLM) to obtain representations of individual sentences, which are then fed\ninto a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to contextualize them within the document.\nThe BiLSTM-produced vectors of adjacent sentences are concatenated and passed\nto a multi-layer perceptron for prediction per adjacency.

Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods\noften fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures\nand costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for\ndefect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained\narchitectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for\ndeployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces\n``Adapt-WeldNet\", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that\nsystematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning\nstrategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and\nhyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights.\nAdditionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA)\nframework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable\nAI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific\nevaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals.\nIncorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the\nprinciples of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and\naccountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in\nautomated decisions through expert validation.

Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic\naccuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional\nonline RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized\nmodels (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models\n(e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B\nparameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally,\nagentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically\nrelevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even\nclinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g.,\nMedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of\nretrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic\nframeworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA,\nparticularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their\nclinical utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLMs\u81ea\u4e3b\u5206\u89e3\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6b65\u68c0\u7d22\u7684RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ee3\u7406RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9LLMs\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22Radiopaedia\u8bc1\u636e\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u5408\u6210\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8624\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684LLMs\u3002", "result": "\u4ee3\u7406\u68c0\u7d22\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0873% vs. 64%\uff09\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\uff089.4%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u572846%\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u4e34\u5e8a\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u653e\u5c04\u5b66QA\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4e2d\u578bLLMs\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e34\u5e8a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

This issue limits the\nquality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of\nautoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key\ninnovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a\ntraining-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the\nlatent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter\nlatent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an\naugmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training\nobjectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence.

In this paper, we suggest the\nuse of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and\nreconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as\nin existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting\nmodels to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry\nresults. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a\ncritical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a\ndiscriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the\nextended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of\nadversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical\ndiscriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a\nspecialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global\nfeatures of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function\nenhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and\nglobally coherent outpainted scenes.

Mamba, as an emerging state space model with\ninherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable\nfor processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,\ndue to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in\napplying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot\nmaintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of\nseverely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the\nhidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the\nunderstanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first\nMamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two\ninnovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to\nmigrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of\nthe internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to\ndynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and\nproviding dynamic local receptive fields.

Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual\nprompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing\nSDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information.\nThird, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to\nfocus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance.\nExtensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance\nof our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting.

These avatars allow for more\nimmersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One\nemerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's\navatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to\ndetect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore\nthe challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our\nmain question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as\nreliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's\nvisual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we\nintroduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a\nstate-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and\nimpostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable\nspatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal\nattention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial\ngestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable\nmeaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%.

Project page:\n  https://gwxuan.github.io/IGL-Nav/", "summary": "Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging\nproblem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or\nmodular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot\nfully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and\nthe goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image\nin 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian\n(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS\noptimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly\nleveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is\nprohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D\nGaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal\nnavigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as\nnew images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely\nlocalize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space\nmatching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent\nis close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization\nvia differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental\nconfigurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal\nsetting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to\ncapture goal image at arbitrary pose.

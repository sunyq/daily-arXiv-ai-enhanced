In such systems, task offloading and\nresource allocation encounter multiple challenges, including node\nheterogeneity, unstable communication links, and dynamic task variations. To\naddress these issues, this paper constructs a three-layer heterogeneous MEC\nsystem architecture for low-altitude economic networks, encompassing aerial and\nground users as well as edge servers. The system is systematically modeled from\nthe perspectives of communication channels, computational costs, and constraint\nconditions, and the joint optimization problem of offloading decisions and\nresource allocation is uniformly abstracted into a graph-structured modeling\ntask. On this basis, we propose a graph attention diffusion-based solution\ngenerator (GADSG). This method integrates the contextual awareness of graph\nattention networks with the solution distribution learning capability of\ndiffusion models, enabling joint modeling and optimization of discrete\noffloading variables and continuous resource allocation variables within a\nhigh-dimensional latent space. We construct multiple simulation datasets with\nvarying scales and topologies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed GADSG model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in\nterms of optimization performance, robustness, and generalization across task\nstructures, showing strong potential for efficient task scheduling in dynamic\nand complex low-altitude economic network environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6269\u6563\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08GADSG\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7a7a\u5730\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u591a\u63a5\u5165\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08MEC\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u8282\u70b9\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u94fe\u8def\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5c42\u5f02\u6784MEC\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGADSG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGADSG\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GADSG\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Although visual\ncropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:\nthe need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed\nexhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.\nWe address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping\nmethod, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the\nsearch for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:\nfirst, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute\nan object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and\nrank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the\nfine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed\nsearch strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA\ndatasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping\nmethods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing\nbaseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.", "AI": {"tldr": "FOCUS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528MLLM\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u6307\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u4f4e\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u6216\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "FOCUS\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\u8bc6\u522bVQA\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u8c61\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u6392\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6392\u540d\u6700\u9ad8\u533a\u57df\u6267\u884cVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "FOCUS\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6VQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e24\u79cdMLLM\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53473-6.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "FOCUS\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Traditional activity-based models require extensive data\ncollection and manual calibration, machine learning approaches struggle with\nadaptation to dynamic conditions, and treding agent-based Large Language Models\n(LLMs) implementations face computational constraints with large-scale\nsimulations. To address these challenges, we propose MobiVerse, a hybrid\nframework leverages the efficiency of lightweight domain-specific generator for\ngenerating base activity chains with the adaptability of LLMs for context-aware\nmodifications. A case study was conducted in Westwood, Los Angeles, where we\nefficiently generated and dynamically adjusted schedules for the whole\npopulation of approximately 53,000 agents on a standard PC. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that MobiVerse successfully enables agents to respond to\nenvironmental feedback, including road closures, large gathering events like\nfootball games, and congestion, through our hybrid framework. Its modular\ndesign facilitates testing various mobility algorithms at both transportation\nsystem and agent levels.

To\nenable long-term, lifelike simulations, we endow agents with beliefs, long-term\ngoals, and spatial memory for navigation. CitySim exhibits closer alignment\nwith real humans than prior work, both at micro and macro levels. Additionally,\nwe conduct insightful experiments by modeling tens of thousands of agents and\nevaluating their collective behaviors under various real-world scenarios,\nincluding estimating crowd density, predicting place popularity, and assessing\nwell-being.

For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must\nbalance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound\nof >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard\nbound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being\nresource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit\npreferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is\ncomputationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive\nframeworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain\nknowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often\nlack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference\nstructures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they\nhaven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in\nhigh-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global\nframework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard\nbounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over\nDM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided\nby an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while\nminimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, Active-MoSH's global component,\nT-MoSH, leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify potentially\noverlooked, high-value points beyond immediate feedback.

However, the\ndata ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and\nincompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail\nto cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this\npaper introduces the concept of \"Query as Test\" (QaT). This concept shifts the\nfocus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries\nagainst a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a\nfundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our\nproposal of \"Extensible Scenarios Notations\" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative\ndata framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly\nrepresents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as\na collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep\nsemantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports\ncomplex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides\nnatural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for\non-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy\nprotection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the\nfunctional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving\nsystems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing\nthe expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the\nconcept of \"Validation-Driven Development\" (VDD), which suggests to guide\ndevelopments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era\nof Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and\ndevelopment process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u201cQuery as Test\u201d\uff08QaT\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u67e5\u8be2\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u201cExtensible Scenarios Notations\u201d\uff08ESN\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ea4\u901a\u9886\u57dfAI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u50f5\u5316\u53ca\u8fb9\u7f18\u6848\u4f8b\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eAnswer Set Programming\uff08ASP\uff09\u7684ESN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u903b\u8f91\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0e\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "result": "ESN\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0cQaT\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0e\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u201cValidation-Driven Development\u201d\uff08VDD\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u4ee5\u903b\u8f91\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6307\u5bfc\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

The paper\nconcludes with a roadmap of five priority research directions, emphasizing\nparticipatory inputs, future-proof content filters, ecosystem-wide safety\ninfrastructure, rigorous agentic safeguards, and expanded harm taxonomies.\nThese recommendations informed the February 2025 French AI Action Summit and\nlay groundwork for an open, plural, and accountable AI safety discipline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u54e5\u4f26\u6bd4\u4e9aAI\u5f00\u653e\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u4f1a\u8bae\uff082024\u5e7411\u6708\uff09\u7684\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3001\u6280\u672f\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u3001\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec745\u540d\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u516d\u5468\u7814\u8ba8\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3001\u6280\u672f\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\u6027\uff08\u900f\u660e\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u516c\u5171\u6cbb\u7406\uff09\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u9632\u5fa1\u653b\u51fb\u673a\u5236\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e94\u9879\u4f18\u5148\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u672a\u6765\u5185\u5bb9\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u3001\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7b49\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u3001\u591a\u5143\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684AI\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are\nincreasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized\nfields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset\nfrom over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites.\nBioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of\n5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces\nBioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main\nabilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing\nsuch knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama,\nand Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve\nlearned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level,\nreal-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the\nneed for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in\nbioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM\nin Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of\nfour selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable\nresults compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a\nROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model\nachieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method.

However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with\nrespect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of\nlandmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This\nerror-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous\nlandmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage\nthe error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we\npropose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)\nfor coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding\nforce in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the\nother hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask\nfocusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent\npoints, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means\nrelaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary\nmanner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we\nintegrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet.

By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse\ninto a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and\nstructural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine\ninstruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad\nspectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual\ngeneralization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with\nadvanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving\nthe way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world\nscenarios.

Capturing quasi-periodic\nsignals in the video is crucial for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)\nestimation. To account for signal periodicity, we apply frame masking in terms\nof video sampling, which allows the model to capture resampled quasi-periodic\nsignals during the pre-training stage. Moreover, the framework incorporates\nphysiological bandlimit constraints, leveraging the property that physiological\nsignals are sparse within their frequency bandwidth to provide pulse cues to\nthe model.

This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering\ndata efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training\ndata organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a\nnovel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model\nforgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the\ndata efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,\nvarious instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying\ndegrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these\ninstances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for\ndata ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy\ncan be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.\nTherefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM\ntraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "DELT\u8303\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff08\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLQS\u548cFO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u6548\u80fd\uff08Data Efficacy\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDELT\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u5206\uff08LQS\uff09\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6392\u5e8f\uff08FO\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u68af\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002", "result": "DELT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0cLQS\u4e0eFO\u7ec4\u5408\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u6548\u80fd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u53ef\u517c\u987e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u6548\u80fd\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u503c\u5f97\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

By tracing the gradients of\nmisclassified validation images, we detect training samples where model errors\nalign with inconsistently rated examples or are affected by subtle, nonclinical\nartifacts. We apply this method to a ConvNeXT based weakly supervised model\ndesigned to classify PsO severity from phone images. Removing 8.2% of flagged\nimages improves model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%) on a held out test set.\nCommonly, multiple annotators and an adjudication process ensure annotation\naccuracy, which is expensive and time consuming. Our method detects training\nimages with annotation inconsistencies, potentially removing the need for\nmanual review. When applied to a subset of training data rated by two\ndermatologists, the method identifies over 90% of cases with inter-rater\ndisagreement by reviewing only the top 30% of samples. This improves automated\nscoring for remote assessments, ensuring robustness despite data collection\nvariability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u94f6\u5c51\u75c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u94f6\u5c51\u75c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002\u8fdc\u7a0b\u6210\u50cf\u867d\u5177\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5149\u7167\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u8d28\u91cf\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u975e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u79fb\u96648.2%\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u56fe\u50cf\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578bAUC-ROC\u63d0\u53475%\uff0885%\u81f390%\uff09\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b90%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

Recent research has focused on\nenhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation,\nsearchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots.

A major factor is\nthat accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is\nchallenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,\ntables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard\nstructure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be\ncomposed of connected text and visual components.

To achieve this, existing\nmethods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling\nstrategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four\nreasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task\nperformance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)\nover strong test-time scaling baselines.

Specifically, we first establish a comprehensive database to reflect\nhuman feedback for AI-generated omnidirectionals, termed OHF2024, which\nincludes both subjective quality ratings evaluated from three perspectives and\ndistortion-aware salient regions. Based on the constructed OHF2024 database, we\npropose two models with shared encoders based on the BLIP-2 model to evaluate\nthe human visual experience and predict distortion-aware saliency for\nAI-generated omnidirectional images, which are named as BLIP2OIQA and\nBLIP2OISal, respectively. Finally, based on the proposed models, we present an\nautomatic optimization process that utilizes the predicted visual experience\nscores and distortion regions to further enhance the visual quality of an\nAI-generated omnidirectional image. Extensive experiments show that our\nBLIP2OIQA model and BLIP2OISal model achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in\nthe human visual experience evaluation task and the distortion-aware saliency\nprediction task for AI generated omnidirectional images, and can be effectively\nused in the optimization process. The database and codes will be released on\nhttps://github.com/IntMeGroup/AIGCOIQA to facilitate future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\uff08AIGODIs\uff09\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u5931\u771f\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93OHF2024\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eBLIP-2\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08BLIP2OIQA\u548cBLIP2OISal\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AIGC\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u5728VR/AR\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86OHF2024\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u5931\u771f\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eBLIP-2\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86BLIP2OIQA\u548cBLIP2OISal\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "BLIP2OIQA\u548cBLIP2OISal\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aAIGODIs\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed\n(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become\navailable. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is\ngreatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key\nground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the\nextraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image\nfeature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS\nimages for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These\nchallenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and\ngenerate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning\nmulti-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes\nfrom the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class\ndisparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly\nlose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor\nsegmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked\ndeep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The\nproposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness\nlong-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual\nblocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient\nglobal dependencies thus improving segmentation performance.

To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which\nintegrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head\nas the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision\nwith vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable\nsegmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features\ninto the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed\nprojection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight\ntrainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with\nthe segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the\nmapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose\nSelective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense\nfeatures exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually\nreducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses.\nBesides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense\nvisual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text\nencoder.

However,\nexisting research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of\nthese models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their\nself-reflection pattern (also termed \"Aha moment\") and the interconnections\nacross diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the\nreasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,\nDeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge\nparadigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their\nfinal outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based\nquestions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step\nproblem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both\nthe coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research\nresults uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and\nexploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning\nprocess. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among\nthese models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the\nreliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their\nthinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1.

Here we present a novel learning paradigm that\nenables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with\nincreasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where\nlabelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human\ncognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I\nmodule for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that\niteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This\nparadigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining\nsolutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through\nextended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning\nbut also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.\nThese tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on\nmedical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for\nnon-verbal machine reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u601d\u8003\u7684System I\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6162\u901f\u601d\u8003\u7684System II\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u73a9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ef6\u957f\u601d\u8003\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751a\u81f3\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u764c\u75c7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3a\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Although autoregressive systems\nexhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token\ngeneration mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of\nsynthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video\ndubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for\nspeech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows\nexplicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration\ncontrol; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely\ngenerate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input\nprompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional\nexpression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and\nemotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the\nemotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a\nseparate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to\nreconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance\nclarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent\nrepresentations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier\nfor emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual\ndescriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3.

A key factor\nis that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking\nmechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a\nsimple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level\nspatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual\nprompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically\ndemonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning\ntasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by\n25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in\nscene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship\ntasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset.

However, recent studies\nindicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas\nMulti-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms\ninherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.\nMotivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing\nframework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed\nto systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing\nlanguage model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as\nefficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing\nclassifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of\neither the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the\nmessage-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach\nisolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,\navoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge\nProbing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge\nencoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,\nconsistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations\nacross different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and\nsemantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation\noperations show beneficial effects.

In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating\nboth the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the\ndissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and\nobserved intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view\ntraining loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly\nenforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is\nperformed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method\nexploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the\nrobustness of the registration process. The proposed framework achieves a mean\ntarget registration error (mTRE) of $0.79 \\pm 2.17$ mm on six specimens from\nthe DeepFluoro dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art registration algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d22D/3D\u521a\u6027\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u89c6\u89d2\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u914d\u51c6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u672f\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u91ce\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u89c6\u89d22D/3D\u914d\u51c6\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8054\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u53c9\u89c6\u89d2\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7ec6\u5316\u4f30\u8ba1\u59ff\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepFluoro\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.79\u00b12.17 mm\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u76ee\u6807\u914d\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7ea6\u675f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u914d\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bfc\u822a\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

While these\nperturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they\ncan actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data\naugmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on\nclassical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical\nmachine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere\nrotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet\neffective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional\naugmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations\nlack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like\nimage classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation\nmethods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to\nclassical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch\nrotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet\ndataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves\nimage classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5\naccuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard\nclassical augmentation methods.

To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective.

Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark\ndatasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL),\nhighlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the\nstatements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and\ndemonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods\nthat aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.\nThese approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical\nvalue of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9ed1\u76d2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff08UQ\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5176\u4ec5\u9700\u6a21\u578bAPI\u8bbf\u95ee\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u9648\u8ff0\u53ca\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u57288\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c3\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u666e\u904d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u2018Sim-Any\u2019\u5047\u8bbe\u6700\u5177\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u9ed1\u76d2UQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u89c2\u5bdf\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While neural generation\nmethods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial\nreasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable\ngeneration but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints\nbecome numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of\nfurniture items and compromising layout completeness.\n  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline\nthat converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D\nindoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a\nconstraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts\nhigh-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a\nstructured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.\nIt then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture\narrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a\nheuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.\nTo handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint\nrepresentation that processes both formal specifications and natural language\ninputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a\ncomprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware\nPositioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to\nminimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms\nexisting methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually\nappealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoomCraft\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u8349\u56fe\u6216\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8fde\u8d2f\u76843D\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u62103D\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u56e0\u5168\u5c40\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u5143\u7d20\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5bb6\u5177\u78b0\u649e\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u5c42\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528HDFS\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u653e\u7f6e\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u7ea6\u675f\u8868\u793a\u548cCAPS\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "RoomCraft\u5728\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u623f\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RoomCraft\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5e03\u5c40\u3002"}}

In real-world applications, however, users\noften seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with\nprecise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing\nmethods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open\nand challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward\nhigh-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.

Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,\nincluding variations in language complexity between individuals and\norganizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and\nbetween those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.\nAdditionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to\nuse more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and\nreliability levels converging toward a common jargon.

The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments\n(forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as\nexplicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed\nlabelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes,\nresulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional,\nrequires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a\nsize manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document\nlevel retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe\nour three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset\nstatistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval\nmethods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in\ncrossdomain patent retrieval.
